# Psalms 86

<p class="intro">A Prayer of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I <i>am</i> poor and needy.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Preserve my soul; for I <i>am</i> holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thou, Lord, <i>art</i> good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Among the gods <i>there is</i> none like unto thee, O Lord; neither <i>are there any works</i> like unto thy works.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> great, and doest wondrous things: thou <i>art</i> God alone.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For great <i>is</i> thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent <i>men</i> have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But thou, O Lord, <i>art</i> a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see <i>it</i>, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.</p>
