# I Corinthians 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Upon the first <i>day</i> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <i>God</i> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <i>your</i> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i>there are</i> many adversaries.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <i>do</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; As touching <i>our</i> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Let all your things be done with charity.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <i>that</i> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <i>us</i>, and laboureth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The salutation of <i>me</i> Paul with mine own hand.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; My love <i>be</i> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p class="ps">The first <i>epistle</i> to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.</p>
