# John 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <i>his</i> birth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Some said, This is he: others <i>said</i>, He is like him: <i>but</i> he said, I am <i>he</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; These <i>words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no</i>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow</i>, we know not from whence he is.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>
