# Job 29

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Oh that I were as <i>in</i> months past, as <i>in</i> the days <i>when</i> God preserved me;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When his candle shined upon my head, <i>and when</i> by his light I walked <i>through</i> darkness;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God <i>was</i> upon my tabernacle;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; When the Almighty <i>was</i> yet with me, <i>when</i> my children <i>were</i> about me;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When I went out to the gate through the city, <i>when</i> I prepared my seat in the street!</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <i>and</i> stood up.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The princes refrained talking, and laid <i>their</i> hand on their mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; When the ear heard <i>me</i>, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <i>me</i>, it gave witness to me:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <i>him that had</i> none to help him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <i>was</i> as a robe and a diadem.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I was eyes to the blind, and feet <i>was</i> I to the lame.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I <i>was</i> a father to the poor: and the cause <i>which</i> I knew not I searched out.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply <i>my</i> days as the sand.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; My root <i>was</i> spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My glory <i>was</i> fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Unto me <i>men</i> gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the latter rain.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; <i>If</i> I laughed on them, they believed <i>it</i> not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one <i>that</i> comforteth the mourners.</p>
