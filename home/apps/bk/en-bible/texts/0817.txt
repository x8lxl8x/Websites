# Ezekiel 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, <i>or than</i> a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <i>men</i> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for <i>any</i> work?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for <i>any</i> work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from <i>one</i> fire, and <i>another</i> fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I set my face against them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
