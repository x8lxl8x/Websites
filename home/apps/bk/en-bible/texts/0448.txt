# Job 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; No doubt but ye <i>are</i> the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But I have understanding as well as you; I <i>am</i> not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I am <i>as</i> one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright <i>man is</i> laughed to scorn.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He that is ready to slip with <i>his</i> feet <i>is as</i> a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth <i>abundantly</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; In whose hand <i>is</i> the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; With the ancient <i>is</i> wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; With him <i>is</i> wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; With him <i>is</i> strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver <i>are</i> his.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them <i>again</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness <i>where there is</i> no way.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like <i>a</i> drunken <i>man</i>.</p>
