# Ezekiel 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <i>even</i> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <i>them</i> over the city. And he went in in my sight.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <i>and stood</i> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard <i>even</i> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And <i>one</i> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that <i>was</i> between the cherubims, and took <i>thereof</i>, and put <i>it</i> into the hands of <i>him that was</i> clothed with linen: who took <i>it</i>, and went out.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <i>was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And <i>as for</i> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <i>were</i> full of eyes round about, <i>even</i> the wheels that they four had.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And every one had four faces: the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub, and the second face <i>was</i> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the cherubims were lifted up. This <i>is</i> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; When they stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when they were lifted up, <i>these</i> lifted up themselves <i>also</i>: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in them.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <i>were</i> beside them, and <i>every one</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <i>were</i> the cherubims.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man <i>was</i> under their wings.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the likeness of their faces <i>was</i> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.</p>
