# Jeremiah 30

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Alas! for that day <i>is</i> great, so that none <i>is</i> like it: it <i>is</i> even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <i>that</i> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make <i>him</i> afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise <i>is</i> incurable, <i>and</i> thy wound <i>is</i> grievous.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>There is</i> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; <i>because</i> thy sins were increased.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <i>is</i> incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <i>because</i> thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, <i>saying</i>, This <i>is</i> Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <i>is</i> this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done <i>it</i>, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</p>
