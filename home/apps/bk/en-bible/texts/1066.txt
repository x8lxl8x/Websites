# I Corinthians 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For who maketh thee to differ <i>from another</i>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <i>it</i>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; We <i>are</i> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <i>are</i> wise in Christ; we <i>are</i> weak, but ye <i>are</i> strong; ye <i>are</i> honourable, but we <i>are</i> despised.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <i>and are</i> the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>have ye</i> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word, but in power.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <i>in</i> the spirit of meekness?</p>
