# Nehemiah 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <i>that</i> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <i>some one of</i> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherein <i>was</i> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <i>it, that</i> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <i>There is</i> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <i>O God</i>, strengthen my hands.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <i>was</i> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <i>is there</i>, that, <i>being</i> as I <i>am</i>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore <i>was</i> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <i>that</i> they might have <i>matter</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <i>thereof</i>, and all the heathen that <i>were</i> about us saw <i>these things</i>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah came unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For <i>there were</i> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <i>was</i> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <i>And</i> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p>
