<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
