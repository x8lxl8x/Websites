# Psalms 85

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned <i>thyself</i> from the fierceness of thine anger.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Surely his salvation <i>is</i> nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed <i>each other</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, the LORD shall give <i>that which is</i> good; and our land shall yield her increase.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set <i>us</i> in the way of his steps.</p>
