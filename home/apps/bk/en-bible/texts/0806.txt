# Ezekiel 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, <i>even</i> Jerusalem:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set <i>battering</i> rams against it round about.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it <i>for</i> a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This <i>shall be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm <i>shall be</i> uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And thy meat which thou shalt eat <i>shall be</i> by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And thou shalt eat it <i>as</i> barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</p>
