# Psalms 20

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up <i>our</i> banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Some <i>trust</i> in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.</p>
