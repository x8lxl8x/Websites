# Revelation 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <i>upon</i> them which worshipped his image.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <i>man</i>: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i>are</i> thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i>come</i> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <i>which</i> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is</i> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and</i> so great.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i>every stone</i> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p>
