# Job 34

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear my words, O ye wise <i>men</i>; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what <i>is</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Should I lie against my right? my wound <i>is</i> incurable without transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; What man <i>is</i> like Job, <i>who</i> drinketh up scorning like water?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <i>that he should do</i> wickedness; and <i>from</i> the Almighty, <i>that he should commit</i> iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to <i>his</i> ways.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If he set his heart upon man, <i>if</i> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; If now <i>thou hast</i> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>Is it fit</i> to say to a king, <i>Thou art</i> wicked? <i>and</i> to princes, <i>Ye are</i> ungodly?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>How much less to him</i> that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all <i>are</i> the work of his hands.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For his eyes <i>are</i> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For he will not lay upon man more <i>than right</i>; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <i>them</i> in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth <i>his</i> face, who then can behold him? whether <i>it be done</i> against a nation, or against a man only:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne <i>chastisement</i>, I will not offend <i>any more</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; <i>That which</i> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; <i>Should it be</i> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words <i>were</i> without wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; My desire <i>is that</i> Job may be tried unto the end because of <i>his</i> answers for wicked men.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth <i>his hands</i> among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
