# Psalms 3

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <i>are</i> they that rise up against me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Many <i>there be</i> which say of my soul, <i>There is</i> no help for him in God. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <i>themselves</i> against me round about.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <i>upon</i> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Salvation <i>belongeth</i> unto the LORD: thy blessing <i>is</i> upon thy people. Selah.</p>
