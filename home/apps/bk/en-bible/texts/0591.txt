# Psalms 113

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name <i>is</i> to be praised.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> high above all nations, <i>and</i> his glory above the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who humbleth <i>himself</i> to behold <i>the things that are</i> in heaven, and in the earth!</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <i>and</i> lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; That he may set <i>him</i> with princes, <i>even</i> with the princes of his people.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He maketh the barren woman to keep house, <i>and to be</i> a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
