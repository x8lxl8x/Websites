# Lamentations 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <i>are</i> as widows.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Our necks <i>are</i> under persecution: we labour, <i>and</i> have no rest.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; We have given the hand <i>to</i> the Egyptians, <i>and to</i> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Our fathers have sinned, <i>and are</i> not; and we have borne their iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Servants have ruled over us: <i>there is</i> none that doth deliver <i>us</i> out of their hand.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; We gat our bread with <i>the peril of</i> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They ravished the women in Zion, <i>and</i> the maids in the cities of Judah.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The crown is fallen <i>from</i> our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For this our heart is faint; for these <i>things</i> our eyes are dim.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, <i>and</i> forsake us so long time?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</p>
