# Song of Solomon 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I <i>am</i> my beloved's, and my beloved <i>is</i> mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as <i>an army</i> with banners.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair <i>is</i> as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thy teeth <i>are</i> as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and <i>there is</i> not one barren among them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; As a piece of a pomegranate <i>are</i> thy temples within thy locks.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; My dove, my undefiled is <i>but</i> one; she <i>is</i> the <i>only</i> one of her mother, she <i>is</i> the choice <i>one</i> of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; <i>yea</i>, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> she <i>that</i> looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, <i>and</i> terrible as <i>an army</i> with banners?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, <i>and</i> to see whether the vine flourished, <i>and</i> the pomegranates budded.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Or ever I was aware, my soul made me <i>like</i> the chariots of Amminadib.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</p>
