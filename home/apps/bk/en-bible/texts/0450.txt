# Job 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Man <i>that is</i> born of a woman <i>is</i> of few days, and full of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who can bring a clean <i>thing</i> out of an unclean? not one.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Seeing his days <i>are</i> determined, the number of his months <i>are</i> with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where <i>is</i> he?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>As</i> the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens <i>be</i> no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If a man die, shall he live <i>again</i>? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; My transgression <i>is</i> sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow <i>out</i> of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; His sons come to honour, and he knoweth <i>it</i> not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth <i>it</i> not of them.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</p>
