# Luke 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i>others</i> with them.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And they remembered his words,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and other <i>women that were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i>about</i> threescore furlongs.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i>together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said unto them, What manner of communications <i>are</i> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <i>it</i> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake, and gave to them.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And they told what things <i>were done</i> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <i>his</i> hands and <i>his</i> feet.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And he took <i>it</i>, and did eat before them.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And he said unto them, These <i>are</i> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in</i> the prophets, and <i>in</i> the psalms, concerning me.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
