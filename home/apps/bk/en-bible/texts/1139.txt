# Hebrews 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And this will we do, if God permit.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For <i>it is</i> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put <i>him</i> to an open shame.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But that which beareth thorns and briers <i>is</i> rejected, and <i>is</i> nigh unto cursing; whose end <i>is</i> to be burned.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For God <i>is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation <i>is</i> to them an end of all strife.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed <i>it</i> by an oath:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; That by two immutable things, in which <i>it was</i> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Which <i>hope</i> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <i>even</i> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
