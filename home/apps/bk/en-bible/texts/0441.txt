# Job 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither <i>is there</i> any to deliver <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform <i>their</i> enterprise.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Behold, happy <i>is</i> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle <i>shall be</i> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Thou shalt know also that thy seed <i>shall be</i> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Thou shalt come to <i>thy</i> grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Lo this, we have searched it, so it <i>is</i>; hear it, and know thou <i>it</i> for thy good.</p>
