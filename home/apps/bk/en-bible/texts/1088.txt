# II Corinthians 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <i>am</i> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But I beseech <i>you</i>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; (For the weapons of our warfare <i>are</i> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <i>is</i> Christ's, even so <i>are</i> we Christ's.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For <i>his</i> letters, say they, <i>are</i> weighty and powerful; but <i>his</i> bodily presence <i>is</i> weak, and <i>his</i> speech contemptible.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <i>will we be</i> also in deed when we are present.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But we will not boast of things without <i>our</i> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For we stretch not ourselves beyond <i>our measure</i>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <i>preaching</i> the gospel of Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Not boasting of things without <i>our</i> measure, <i>that is</i>, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; To preach the gospel in the <i>regions</i> beyond you, <i>and</i> not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
