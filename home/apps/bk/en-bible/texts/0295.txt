# I Kings 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; So king Solomon was king over all Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And these <i>were</i> the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar <i>were</i> the priests:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Azariah the son of Nathan <i>was</i> over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan <i>was</i> principal officer, <i>and</i> the king's friend:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Ahishar <i>was</i> over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda <i>was</i> over the tribute.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him <i>pertained</i> Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Baana the son of Ahilud; <i>to him pertained</i> Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which <i>is</i> by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, <i>even</i> unto <i>the place that is</i> beyond Jokneam:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him <i>pertained</i> the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which <i>are</i> in Gilead; to him <i>also pertained</i> the region of Argob, which <i>is</i> in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Ahinadab the son of Iddo <i>had</i> Mahanaim:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Ahimaaz <i>was</i> in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Baanah the son of Hushai <i>was</i> in Asher and in Aloth:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Geber the son of Uri <i>was</i> in the country of Gilead, <i>in</i> the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and <i>he was</i> the only officer which <i>was</i> in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Judah and Israel <i>were</i> many, as the sand which <i>is</i> by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For he had dominion over all <i>the region</i> on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where <i>the officers</i> were, every man according to his charge.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that <i>is</i> on the sea shore.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that <i>is</i> in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p>
