# Romans 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <i>execute</i> wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Wherefore <i>ye</i> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <i>is due</i>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <i>there be</i> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <i>is</i> the fulfilling of the law.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And that, knowing the time, that now <i>it is</i> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <i>is</i> our salvation nearer than when we believed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <i>fulfil</i> the lusts <i>thereof</i>.</p>
