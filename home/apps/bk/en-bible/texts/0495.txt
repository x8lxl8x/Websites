# Psalms 17

<p class="intro">A Prayer of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, <i>that goeth</i> not out of feigned lips.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <i>me</i> in the night; thou hast tried me, <i>and</i> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <i>that</i> my mouth shall not transgress.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <i>me from</i> the paths of the destroyer.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Hold up my goings in thy paths, <i>that</i> my footsteps slip not.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <i>and hear</i> my speech.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust <i>in thee</i> from those that rise up <i>against them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; From the wicked that oppress me, <i>from</i> my deadly enemies, <i>who</i> compass me about.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Like as a lion <i>that</i> is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, <i>which is</i> thy sword:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; From men <i>which are</i> thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <i>which have</i> their portion in <i>this</i> life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid <i>treasure</i>: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their <i>substance</i> to their babes.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</p>
