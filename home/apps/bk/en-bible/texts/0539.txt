# Psalms 61

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Neginah, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <i>that</i> is higher than I.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou hast been a shelter for me, <i>and</i> a strong tower from the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given <i>me</i> the heritage of those that fear thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou wilt prolong the king's life: <i>and</i> his years as many generations.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, <i>which</i> may preserve him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</p>
