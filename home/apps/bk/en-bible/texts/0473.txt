# Job 37

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound <i>that</i> goeth out of his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For he saith to the snow, Be thou <i>on</i> the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; How thy garments <i>are</i> warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south <i>wind</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Hast thou with him spread out the sky, <i>which is</i> strong, <i>and</i> as a molten looking glass?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Teach us what we shall say unto him; <i>for</i> we cannot order <i>our speech</i> by reason of darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And now <i>men</i> see not the bright light which <i>is</i> in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God <i>is</i> terrible majesty.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>Touching</i> the Almighty, we cannot find him out: <i>he is</i> excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any <i>that are</i> wise of heart.</p>
