# Psalms 146

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Put not your trust in princes, <i>nor</i> in the son of man, in whom <i>there is</i> no help.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Happy <i>is he</i> that <i>hath</i> the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope <i>is</i> in the LORD his God:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein <i>is</i>: which keepeth truth for ever:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD openeth <i>the eyes of</i> the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The LORD shall reign for ever, <i>even</i> thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
