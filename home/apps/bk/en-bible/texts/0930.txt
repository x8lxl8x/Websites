# Matthew 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <i>that had been the wife</i> of Urias;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So all the generations from Abraham to David <i>are</i> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon <i>are</i> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ <i>are</i> fourteen generations.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then Joseph her husband, being a just <i>man</i>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</p>
