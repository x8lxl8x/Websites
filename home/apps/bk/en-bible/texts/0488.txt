# Psalms 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? <i>why</i> hidest thou <i>thyself</i> in times of trouble?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The wicked in <i>his</i> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, <i>whom</i> the LORD abhorreth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <i>after God</i>: God <i>is</i> not in all his thoughts.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <i>are</i> far above out of his sight: <i>as for</i> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <i>I shall</i> never <i>be</i> in adversity.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <i>is</i> mischief and vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He croucheth, <i>and</i> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou hast seen <i>it</i>; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <i>it</i> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <i>man</i>: seek out his wickedness <i>till</i> thou find none.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>
