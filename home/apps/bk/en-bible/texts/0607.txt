# Psalms 129

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let them be as the grass <i>upon</i> the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <i>be</i> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</p>
