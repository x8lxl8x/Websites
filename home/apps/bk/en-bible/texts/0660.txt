# Ecclesiastes 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <i>is</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>One</i> generation passeth away, and <i>another</i> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <i>is</i> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; All things <i>are</i> full of labour; man cannot utter <i>it</i>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The thing that hath been, it <i>is that</i> which shall be; and that which is done <i>is</i> that which shall be done: and <i>there is</i> no new <i>thing</i> under the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Is there <i>any</i> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <i>is</i> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no remembrance of former <i>things</i>; neither shall there be <i>any</i> remembrance of <i>things</i> that are to come with <i>those</i> that shall come after.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <i>things</i> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>That which is</i> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <i>they</i> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For in much wisdom <i>is</i> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
