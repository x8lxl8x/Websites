# Job 27

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>As</i> God liveth, <i>who</i> hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, <i>who</i> hath vexed my soul;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; All the while my breath <i>is</i> in me, and the spirit of God <i>is</i> in my nostrils;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach <i>me</i> so long as I live.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For what <i>is</i> the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I will teach you by the hand of God: <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Behold, all ye yourselves have seen <i>it</i>; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, <i>which</i> they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If his children be multiplied, <i>it is</i> for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He may prepare <i>it</i>, but the just shall put <i>it</i> on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth <i>that</i> the keeper maketh.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he <i>is</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For <i>God</i> shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>Men</i> shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
