# Zechariah 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus <i>shall be</i> the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, <i>shall be</i> toward the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Ashkelon shall see <i>it</i>, and fear; Gaza also <i>shall see it</i>, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, <i>shall be</i> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he <i>is</i> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion <i>shall be</i> from sea <i>even</i> to sea, and from the river <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein <i>is</i> no water.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare <i>that</i> I will render double unto thee;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, <i>and</i> make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, <i>and</i> as the corners of the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they <i>shall be as</i> the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For how great <i>is</i> his goodness, and how great <i>is</i> his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</p>
