# I Corinthians 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts</i>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <i>that</i> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the body is not one member, but many.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>were</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>were</i> the smelling?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And if they were all one member, where <i>were</i> the body?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But now <i>are they</i> many members, yet but one body.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And those <i>members</i> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For our comely <i>parts</i> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <i>part</i> which lacked:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; That there should be no schism in the body; but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care one for another.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; <i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>are</i> all prophets? <i>are</i> all teachers? <i>are</i> all workers of miracles?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</p>
