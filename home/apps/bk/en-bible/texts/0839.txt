# Ezekiel 37

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which <i>was</i> full of bones,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <i>there were</i> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <i>they were</i> very dry.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but <i>there was</i> no breath in them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>, and performed <i>it</i>, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel his companions:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou <i>meanest</i> by these?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which <i>is</i> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, <i>even</i> with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And David my servant <i>shall be</i> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, <i>even</i> they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David <i>shall be</i> their prince for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
