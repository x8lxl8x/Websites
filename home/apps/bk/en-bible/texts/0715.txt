# Isaiah 36

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, <i>that</i> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I say, <i>sayest thou</i>, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <i>is it</i> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i>it</i>: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that <i>are</i> on the wall.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? <i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me <i>by</i> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>Beware</i> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Who <i>are they</i> among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>
