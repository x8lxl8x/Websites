# John 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every <i>branch</i> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I am the vine, ye <i>are</i> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire, and they are burned.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <i>that</i> your joy might be full.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <i>that</i> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <i>it hated</i> you.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But <i>this cometh to pass</i>, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <i>even</i> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</p>
