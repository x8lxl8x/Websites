# Matthew 28

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day</i> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i>even</i> unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>
