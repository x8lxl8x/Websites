# Job 33

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My words <i>shall be of</i> the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If thou canst answer me, set <i>thy words</i> in order before me, stand up.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Behold, I <i>am</i> according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of <i>thy</i> words, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I am clean without transgression, I <i>am</i> innocent; neither <i>is there</i> iniquity in me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Behold, <i>in</i> this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For God speaketh once, yea twice, <i>yet man</i> perceiveth it not.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That he may withdraw man <i>from his</i> purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong <i>pain</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones <i>that</i> were not seen stick out.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He looketh upon men, and <i>if any</i> say, I have sinned, and perverted <i>that which was</i> right, and it profited me not;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Lo, all these <i>things</i> worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
