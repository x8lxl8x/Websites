# Psalms 149

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, <i>and</i> his praise in the congregation of saints.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Let</i> the high <i>praises</i> of God <i>be</i> in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, <i>and</i> punishments upon the people;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
