# Hosea 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him <i>in</i> Bethel, and there he spake with us;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD <i>is</i> his memorial.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>He is</i> a merchant, the balances of deceit <i>are</i> in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: <i>in</i> all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that <i>were</i> sin.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I <i>that am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>Is there</i> iniquity <i>in</i> Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars <i>are</i> as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept <i>sheep</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Ephraim provoked <i>him</i> to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</p>
