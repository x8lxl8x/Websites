# Psalms 21

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He asked life of thee, <i>and</i> thou gavest <i>it</i> him, <i>even</i> length of days for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; His glory <i>is</i> great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, <i>which</i> they are not able <i>to perform</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, <i>when</i> thou shalt make ready <i>thine arrows</i> upon thy strings against the face of them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: <i>so</i> will we sing and praise thy power.</p>
