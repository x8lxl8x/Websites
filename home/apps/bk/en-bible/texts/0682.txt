# Isaiah 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I will give children <i>to be</i> their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, <i>saying</i>, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and <i>let</i> this ruin <i>be</i> under thy hand:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house <i>is</i> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings <i>are</i> against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide <i>it</i> not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Say ye to the righteous, that <i>it shall be</i> well <i>with him</i>: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Woe unto the wicked! <i>it shall be</i> ill <i>with him</i>: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>As for</i> my people, children <i>are</i> their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause <i>thee</i> to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor <i>is</i> in your houses.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; What mean ye <i>that</i> ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing <i>as</i> they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <i>their</i> tinkling ornaments <i>about their feet</i>, and <i>their</i> cauls, and <i>their</i> round tires like the moon,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The rings, and nose jewels,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; <i>and</i> burning instead of beauty.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she <i>being</i> desolate shall sit upon the ground.</p>
