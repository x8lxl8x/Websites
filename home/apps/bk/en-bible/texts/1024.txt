# Acts 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples <i>unto them</i>, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid <i>their</i> hands on them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called <i>the synagogue</i> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and <i>against</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon <i>him</i>, and caught him, and brought <i>him</i> to the council,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p>
