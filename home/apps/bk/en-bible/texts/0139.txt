# Numbers 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan <i>by</i> Jericho.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they <i>were</i> many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all <i>that are</i> round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor <i>was</i> king of the Moabites at that time.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <i>is</i> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they <i>are</i> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, <i>that</i> we may smite them, and <i>that</i> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest <i>is</i> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <i>are</i> these with thee?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, <i>there is</i> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <i>are</i> blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <i>and</i> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <i>being</i> on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And the ass said unto Balaam, <i>Am</i> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <i>I was</i> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <i>thy</i> way is perverse before me:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <i>is</i> in the border of Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the utmost coast.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <i>were</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <i>part</i> of the people.</p>
