# Psalms 59

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not <i>for</i> my transgression, nor <i>for</i> my sin, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They run and prepare themselves without <i>my</i> fault: awake to help me, and behold.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords <i>are</i> in their lips: for who, <i>say they</i>, doth hear?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Because of</i> his strength will I wait upon thee: for God <i>is</i> my defence.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see <i>my desire</i> upon mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>For</i> the sin of their mouth <i>and</i> the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying <i>which</i> they speak.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Consume <i>them</i> in wrath, consume <i>them</i>, that they <i>may</i> not <i>be</i>: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And at evening let them return; <i>and</i> let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God <i>is</i> my defence, <i>and</i> the God of my mercy.</p>
