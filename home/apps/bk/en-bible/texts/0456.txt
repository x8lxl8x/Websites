# Job 20

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for <i>this</i> I make haste.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Knowest thou <i>not</i> this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is</i> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <i>but</i> for a moment?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where <i>is</i> he?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The eye also <i>which</i> saw him shall <i>see him</i> no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; His bones are full <i>of the sin</i> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, <i>though</i> he hide it under his tongue;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>Though</i> he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> his meat in his bowels is turned, <i>it is</i> the gall of asps within him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow <i>it</i> down: according to <i>his</i> substance <i>shall</i> the restitution <i>be</i>, and he shall not rejoice <i>therein</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Because he hath oppressed <i>and</i> hath forsaken the poor; <i>because</i> he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>When</i> he is about to fill his belly, <i>God</i> shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain <i>it</i> upon him while he is eating.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He shall flee from the iron weapon, <i>and</i> the bow of steel shall strike him through.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors <i>are</i> upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; All darkness <i>shall be</i> hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The increase of his house shall depart, <i>and his goods</i> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p>
