# Exodus 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And this <i>is</i> the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' <i>hair</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; According to all that I shew thee, <i>after</i> the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they shall make an ark <i>of</i> shittim wood: two cubits and a half <i>shall be</i> the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put <i>them</i> in the four corners thereof; and two rings <i>shall be</i> in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And thou shalt make staves <i>of</i> shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And thou shalt make a mercy seat <i>of</i> pure gold: two cubits and a half <i>shall be</i> the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And thou shalt make two cherubims <i>of</i> gold, <i>of</i> beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: <i>even</i> of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the cherubims shall stretch forth <i>their</i> wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces <i>shall look</i> one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which <i>are</i> upon the ark of the testimony, of all <i>things</i> which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thou shalt also make a table <i>of</i> shittim wood: two cubits <i>shall be</i> the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that <i>are</i> on the four feet thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And thou shalt make the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: <i>of</i> pure gold shalt thou make them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And thou shalt make a candlestick <i>of</i> pure gold: <i>of</i> beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Three bowls made like unto almonds, <i>with</i> a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, <i>with</i> a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And in the candlestick <i>shall be</i> four bowls made like unto almonds, <i>with</i> their knops and their flowers.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And <i>there shall be</i> a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it <i>shall be</i> one beaten work <i>of</i> pure gold.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, <i>shall be of</i> pure gold.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; <i>Of</i> a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And look that thou make <i>them</i> after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.</p>
