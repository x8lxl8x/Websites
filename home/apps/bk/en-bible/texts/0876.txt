# Hosea 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive <i>us</i> graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, <i>Ye are</i> our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive <i>as</i> the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof <i>shall be</i> as the wine of Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Ephraim <i>shall say</i>, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard <i>him</i>, and observed him: I <i>am</i> like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> wise, and he shall understand these <i>things</i>? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD <i>are</i> right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>
