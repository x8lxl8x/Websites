# Romans 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; (For not the hearers of the law <i>are</i> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <i>their</i> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And knowest <i>his</i> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <i>is that</i> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But he <i>is</i> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <i>is that</i> of the heart, in the spirit, <i>and</i> not in the letter; whose praise <i>is</i> not of men, but of God.</p>
