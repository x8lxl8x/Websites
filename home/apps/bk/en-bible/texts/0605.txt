# Psalms 127

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees for Solomon.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh <i>but</i> in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>It is</i> vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: <i>for</i> so he giveth his beloved sleep.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Lo, children <i>are</i> an heritage of the LORD: <i>and</i> the fruit of the womb <i>is his</i> reward.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; As arrows <i>are</i> in the hand of a mighty man; so <i>are</i> children of the youth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p>
