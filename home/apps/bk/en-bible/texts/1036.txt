# Acts 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>was</i> Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <i>his</i> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <i>be</i> upon your own heads; I <i>am</i> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <i>man's</i> house, named Justus, <i>one</i> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he continued <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Saying, This <i>fellow</i> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And when Paul was now about to open <i>his</i> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <i>ye</i> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But if it be a question of words and names, and <i>of</i> your law, look ye <i>to it</i>; for I will be no judge of such <i>matters</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <i>him</i> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Paul <i>after this</i> tarried <i>there</i> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <i>his</i> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; When they desired <i>him</i> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And after he had spent some time <i>there</i>, he departed, and went over <i>all</i> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <i>and</i> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <i>them</i>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For he mightily convinced the Jews, <i>and that</i> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p>
