# Judges 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name <i>was</i> Micah.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver <i>is</i> with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed <i>be thou</i> of the LORD, my son.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when he had restored the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel, <i>but</i> every man did <i>that which was</i> right in his own eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who <i>was</i> a Levite, and he sojourned there.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find <i>a place</i>: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I <i>am</i> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find <i>a place</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to <i>my</i> priest.</p>
