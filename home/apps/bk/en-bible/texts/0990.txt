# Luke 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe <i>unto him</i>, through whom they come!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And they lifted up <i>their</i> voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And when he saw <i>them</i>, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And fell down on <i>his</i> face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where <i>are</i> the nine?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after <i>them</i>, nor follow <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one <i>part</i> under heaven, shineth unto the other <i>part</i> under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <i>them</i> all.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Remember Lot's wife.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; I tell you, in that night there shall be two <i>men</i> in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Two <i>women</i> shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Two <i>men</i> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body <i>is</i>, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
