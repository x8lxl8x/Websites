# Isaiah 33

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou <i>wast</i> not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; <i>and</i> when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And your spoil shall be gathered <i>like</i> the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, <i>and</i> strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD <i>is</i> his treasure.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The earth mourneth <i>and</i> languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed <i>and</i> hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off <i>their fruits</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, <i>as</i> fire, shall devour you.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the people shall be <i>as</i> the burnings of lime: <i>as</i> thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Hear, ye <i>that are</i> far off, what I have done; and, ye <i>that are</i> near, acknowledge my might.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He shall dwell on high: his place of defence <i>shall be</i> the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters <i>shall be</i> sure.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where <i>is</i> the scribe? where <i>is</i> the receiver? where <i>is</i> he that counted the towers?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, <i>that thou canst</i> not understand.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle <i>that</i> shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But there the glorious LORD <i>will be</i> unto us a place of broad rivers <i>and</i> streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For the LORD <i>is</i> our judge, the LORD <i>is</i> our lawgiver, the LORD <i>is</i> our king; he will save us.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein <i>shall be</i> forgiven <i>their</i> iniquity.</p>
