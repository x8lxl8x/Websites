# Psalms 104

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who coverest <i>thyself</i> with light as <i>with</i> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Who</i> laid the foundations of the earth, <i>that</i> it should not be removed for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou coveredst it with the deep as <i>with</i> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <i>which</i> run among the hills.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <i>which</i> sing among the branches.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And wine <i>that</i> maketh glad the heart of man, <i>and</i> oil to make <i>his</i> face to shine, and bread <i>which</i> strengtheneth man's heart.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The trees of the LORD are full <i>of sap</i>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Where the birds make their nests: <i>as for</i> the stork, the fir trees <i>are</i> her house.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The high hills <i>are</i> a refuge for the wild goats; <i>and</i> the rocks for the conies.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <i>forth</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; <i>So is</i> this great and wide sea, wherein <i>are</i> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; There go the ships: <i>there is</i> that leviathan, <i>whom</i> thou hast made to play therein.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <i>them</i> their meat in due season.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; <i>That</i> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
