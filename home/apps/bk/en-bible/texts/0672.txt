## Song of Solomon ##
# Song of Solomon 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The song of songs, which <i>is</i> Solomon's.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <i>is</i> better than wine.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <i>is as</i> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I <i>am</i> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Look not upon me, because I <i>am</i> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; <i>but</i> mine own vineyard have I not kept.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest <i>thy flock</i> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thy cheeks are comely with rows <i>of jewels</i>, thy neck with chains <i>of gold</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; While the king <i>sitteth</i> at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; A bundle of myrrh <i>is</i> my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; My beloved <i>is</i> unto me <i>as</i> a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair, my love; behold, thou <i>art</i> fair; thou <i>hast</i> doves' eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed <i>is</i> green.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The beams of our house <i>are</i> cedar, <i>and</i> our rafters of fir.</p>
