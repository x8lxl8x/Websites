# Ezekiel 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause <i>it</i> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <i>hair</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <i>and</i> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <i>for</i> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <i>is</i> Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries <i>that are</i> round about her.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <i>are</i> round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that <i>are</i> round about you, <i>and</i> have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that <i>are</i> round about you;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, <i>am</i> against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wherefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish <i>thee</i>; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i> in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that <i>are</i> round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that <i>are</i> round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for <i>their</i> destruction, <i>and</i> which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</p>
