# Exodus 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I <i>am</i> the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by <i>the name of</i> God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I <i>am</i> the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; These <i>be</i> the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these <i>be</i> the families of Reuben.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these <i>are</i> the families of Simeon.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and seven years.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and three years.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these <i>are</i> the families of Levi according to their generations.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram <i>were</i> an hundred and thirty and seven years.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these <i>are</i> the families of the Korhites.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Eleazar Aaron's son took him <i>one</i> of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these <i>are</i> the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; These <i>are</i> that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; These <i>are</i> they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these <i>are</i> that Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And it came to pass on the day <i>when</i> the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I <i>am</i> the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?</p>
