# Job 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Is it</i> any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or <i>is it</i> gain <i>to him</i>, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But <i>as for</i> the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore snares <i>are</i> round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Or darkness, <i>that</i> thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thick clouds <i>are</i> a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Yet he filled their houses with good <i>things</i>: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The righteous see <i>it</i>, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the <i>gold</i> of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; When <i>men</i> are cast down, then thou shalt say, <i>There is</i> lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p>
