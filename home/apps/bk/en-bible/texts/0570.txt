# Psalms 92

<p class="intro">A Psalm <i>or</i> Song for the sabbath day.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; <i>It is a</i> good <i>thing</i> to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O LORD, how great are thy works! <i>and</i> thy thoughts are very deep.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; <i>it is</i> that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But thou, LORD, <i>art most</i> high for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But my horn shalt thou exalt like <i>the horn of</i> an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Mine eye also shall see <i>my desire</i> on mine enemies, <i>and</i> mine ears shall hear <i>my desire</i> of the wicked that rise up against me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; To shew that the LORD <i>is</i> upright: <i>he is</i> my rock, and <i>there is</i> no unrighteousness in him.</p>
