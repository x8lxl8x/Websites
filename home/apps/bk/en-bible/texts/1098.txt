# Ephesians 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; <i>even</i> in him:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In whom ye also <i>trusted</i>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And what <i>is</i> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <i>him</i> at his own right hand in the heavenly <i>places</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And hath put all <i>things</i> under his feet, and gave him <i>to be</i> the head over all <i>things</i> to the church,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>
