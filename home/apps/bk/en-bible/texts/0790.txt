# Jeremiah 45

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, <i>that</i> which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek <i>them</i> not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.</p>
