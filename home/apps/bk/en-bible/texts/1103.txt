# Ephesians 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Servants, be obedient to them that are <i>your</i> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether <i>he be</i> bond or free.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i>places</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But that ye also may know my affairs, <i>and</i> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and <i>that</i> he might comfort your hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Peace <i>be</i> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</p>
