# Psalms 48

<p class="intro">A Song <i>and</i> Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, <i>in</i> the mountain of his holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, <i>is</i> mount Zion, <i>on</i> the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They saw <i>it, and</i> so they marvelled; they were troubled, <i>and</i> hasted away.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Fear took hold upon them there, <i>and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; According to thy name, O God, so <i>is</i> thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell <i>it</i> to the generation following.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For this God <i>is</i> our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide <i>even</i> unto death.</p>
