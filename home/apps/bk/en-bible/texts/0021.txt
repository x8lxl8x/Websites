# Genesis 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, <i>so that</i> all that hear will laugh with me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born <i>him</i> a son in his old age.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the <i>same</i> day that Isaac was weaned.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i>even</i> with Isaac.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he <i>is</i> thy seed.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave <i>it</i> unto Hagar, putting <i>it</i> on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And she went, and sat her down over against <i>him</i> a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against <i>him</i>, and lift up her voice, and wept.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God <i>is</i> with thee in all that thou doest:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: <i>but</i> according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I <i>of it</i>, but to day.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What <i>mean</i> these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he said, For <i>these</i> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And <i>Abraham</i> planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p>
