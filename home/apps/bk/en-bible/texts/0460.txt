# Job 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>Some</i> remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed <i>thereof</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, <i>as</i> wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness <i>yieldeth</i> food for them <i>and</i> for <i>their</i> children.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They reap <i>every one</i> his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that <i>they have</i> no covering in the cold.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They cause <i>him</i> to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf <i>from</i> the hungry;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>Which</i> make oil within their walls, <i>and</i> tread <i>their</i> winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly <i>to them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth <i>his</i> face.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; In the dark they dig through houses, <i>which</i> they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the morning <i>is</i> to them even as the shadow of death: if <i>one</i> know <i>them, they are in</i> the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He <i>is</i> swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Drought and heat consume the snow waters: <i>so doth</i> the grave <i>those which</i> have sinned.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He evil entreateth the barren <i>that</i> beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no <i>man</i> is sure of life.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>Though</i> it be given him <i>to be</i> in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes <i>are</i> upon their ways.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all <i>other</i>, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And if <i>it be</i> not <i>so</i> now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>
