# Revelation 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Nevertheless I have <i>somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <i>I know</i> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <i>are</i> the synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <i>some</i> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <i>even</i> where Satan's seat <i>is</i>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <i>was</i> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <i>are</i> like fine brass;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <i>to be</i> more than the first.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But that which ye have <i>already</i> hold fast till I come.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And I will give him the morning star.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
