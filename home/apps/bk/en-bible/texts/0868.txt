# Hosea 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then shall we know, <i>if</i> we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Therefore have I hewed <i>them</i> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <i>are as</i> the light <i>that</i> goeth forth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Gilead <i>is</i> a city of them that work iniquity, <i>and is</i> polluted with blood.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i>so</i> the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there <i>is</i> the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</p>
