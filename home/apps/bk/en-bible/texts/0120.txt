# Numbers 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; These also <i>are</i> the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day <i>that</i> the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they <i>are</i> wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Because all the firstborn <i>are</i> mine; <i>for</i> on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These <i>are</i> the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Of Gershon <i>was</i> the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these <i>are</i> the families of the Gershonites.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <i>even</i> those that were numbered of them <i>were</i> seven thousand and five hundred.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites <i>shall be</i> Eliasaph the son of Lael.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation <i>shall be</i> the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which <i>is</i> by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And of Kohath <i>was</i> the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these <i>are</i> the families of the Kohathites.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites <i>shall be</i> Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And their charge <i>shall be</i> the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest <i>shall be</i> chief over the chief of the Levites, <i>and have</i> the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Of Merari <i>was</i> the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these <i>are</i> the families of Merari.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> six thousand and two hundred.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari <i>was</i> Zuriel the son of Abihail: <i>these</i> shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And <i>under</i> the custody and charge of the sons of Merari <i>shall be</i> the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, <i>even</i> before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, <i>shall be</i> Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> twenty and two thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I <i>am</i> the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take <i>them</i>: (the shekel <i>is</i> twenty gerahs:)</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five <i>shekels</i>, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
