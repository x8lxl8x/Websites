# Numbers 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And <i>when</i> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took <i>some</i> of them prisoners.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <i>there is</i> no bread, neither <i>is there any</i> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which <i>is</i> before Moab, toward the sunrising.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon <i>is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And from thence <i>they went</i> to Beer: that <i>is</i> the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by <i>the direction of</i> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness <i>they went</i> to Mattanah:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And from Bamoth <i>in</i> the valley, that <i>is</i> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <i>of</i> the waters of the well: <i>but</i> we will go along by the king's <i>high</i> way, until we be past thy borders.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <i>was</i> strong.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For Heshbon <i>was</i> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <i>and</i> the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which <i>reacheth</i> unto Medeba.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <i>were</i> there.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p>
