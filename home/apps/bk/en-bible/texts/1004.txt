# John 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and <i>then</i> I go unto him that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come?</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And every man went unto his own house.</p>
