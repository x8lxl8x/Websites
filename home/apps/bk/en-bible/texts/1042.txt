# Acts 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and <i>with</i> a certain orator <i>named</i> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i>him</i>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; We accept <i>it</i> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For we have found this man <i>a</i> pestilent <i>fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the chief captain Lysias came <i>upon us</i>, and with great violence took <i>him</i> away out of our hands,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <i>toward</i> men.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Or else let these same <i>here</i> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i>that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
