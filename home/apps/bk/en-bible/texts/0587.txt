# Psalms 109

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For my love they are my adversaries: but I <i>give myself unto</i> prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let his days be few; <i>and</i> let another take his office.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <i>their bread</i> also out of their desolate places.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let his posterity be cut off; <i>and</i> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Let it be unto him as the garment <i>which</i> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>Let</i> this <i>be</i> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy <i>is</i> good, deliver thou me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I became also a reproach unto them: <i>when</i> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; That they may know that this <i>is</i> thy hand; <i>that</i> thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <i>him</i> from those that condemn his soul.</p>
