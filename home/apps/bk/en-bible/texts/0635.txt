# Proverbs 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Say unto wisdom, Thou <i>art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And, behold, there met him a woman <i>with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; (She <i>is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now <i>is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; So she caught him, and kissed him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i>works</i>, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i>is</i> for his life.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <i>men</i> have been slain by her.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Her house <i>is</i> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
