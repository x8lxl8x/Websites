# Isaiah 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The earth mourneth <i>and</i> fadeth away, the world languisheth <i>and</i> fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, <i>there shall be</i> as the shaking of an olive tree, <i>and</i> as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, <i>even</i> the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, <i>even</i> glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i>are</i> upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones <i>that are</i> on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they shall be gathered together, <i>as</i> prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.</p>
