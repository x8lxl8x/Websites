# Psalms 116

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice <i>and</i> my supplications.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon <i>him</i> as long as I live.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Gracious <i>is</i> the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God <i>is</i> merciful.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, <i>and</i> my feet from falling.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I said in my haste, All men <i>are</i> liars.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; What shall I render unto the LORD <i>for</i> all his benefits toward me?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Precious in the sight of the LORD <i>is</i> the death of his saints.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; O LORD, truly I <i>am</i> thy servant; I <i>am</i> thy servant, <i>and</i> the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
