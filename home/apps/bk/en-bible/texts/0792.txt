# Jeremiah 47

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <i>horses</i>, at the rushing of his chariots, <i>and at</i> the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <i>their</i> children for feebleness of hands;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, <i>and</i> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <i>with</i> the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O thou sword of the LORD, how long <i>will it be</i> ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.</p>
