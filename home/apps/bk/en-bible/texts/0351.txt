# I Chronicles 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that it be</i> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</p>
