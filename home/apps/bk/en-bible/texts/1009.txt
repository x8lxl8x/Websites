# John 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, which should betray him,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed <i>is</i> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and <i>that</i> they had done these things unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, I have both glorified <i>it</i>, and will glorify <i>it</i> again.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <i>it</i>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him</i>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
