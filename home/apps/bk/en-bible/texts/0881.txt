# Amos 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, <i>and</i> with the sound of the trumpet:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <i>same</i> maid, to profane my holy name:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And they lay <i>themselves</i> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned <i>in</i> the house of their god.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height <i>was</i> like the height of the cedars, and he <i>was</i> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. <i>Is it</i> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed <i>that is</i> full of sheaves.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and <i>he that is</i> swift of foot shall not deliver <i>himself</i>: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And <i>he that is</i> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</p>
