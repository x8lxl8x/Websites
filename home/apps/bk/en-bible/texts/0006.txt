# Genesis 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they <i>were</i> fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also <i>is</i> flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare <i>children</i> to them, the same <i>became</i> mighty men which <i>were</i> of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And GOD saw that the wickedness of man <i>was</i> great in the earth, and <i>that</i> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i>was</i> only evil continually.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man <i>and</i> perfect in his generations, <i>and</i> Noah walked with God.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And this <i>is the fashion</i> which thou shalt make it <i>of</i>: The length of the ark <i>shall be</i> three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; <i>with</i> lower, second, and third <i>stories</i> shalt thou make it.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein <i>is</i> the breath of life, from under heaven; <i>and</i> every thing that <i>is</i> in the earth shall die.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every <i>sort</i> shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep <i>them</i> alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every <i>sort</i> shall come unto thee, to keep <i>them</i> alive.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather <i>it</i> to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.</p>
