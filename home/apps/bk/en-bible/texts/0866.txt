# Hosea 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <i>there is</i> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people <i>are</i> as they that strive with the priest.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <i>therefore</i> will I change their glory into shame.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <i>them</i> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <i>is</i> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <i>that</i> doth not understand shall fall.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <i>yet</i> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Ephraim <i>is</i> joined to idols: let him alone.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers <i>with</i> shame do love, Give ye.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</p>
