# Psalms 33

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: <i>for</i> praise is comely for the upright.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery <i>and</i> an instrument of ten strings.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the word of the LORD <i>is</i> right; and all his works <i>are done</i> in truth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For he spake, and it was <i>done</i>; he commanded, and it stood fast.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the nation whose God <i>is</i> the LORD; <i>and</i> the people <i>whom</i> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; An horse <i>is</i> a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver <i>any</i> by his great strength.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Behold, the eye of the LORD <i>is</i> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <i>is</i> our help and our shield.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</p>
