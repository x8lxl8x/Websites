# I Corinthians 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; It is reported commonly <i>that there is</i> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Your glorying <i>is</i> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
