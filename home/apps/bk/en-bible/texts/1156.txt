# I Peter 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight <i>thereof</i>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Neither as being lords over <i>God's</i> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all <i>of you</i> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; To him <i>be</i> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The <i>church that is</i> at Babylon, elected together with <i>you</i>, saluteth you; and <i>so doth</i> Marcus my son.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace <i>be</i> with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
