# Psalms 147

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD: for <i>it is</i> good to sing praises unto our God; for <i>it is</i> pleasant; <i>and</i> praise is comely.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by <i>their</i> names.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Great <i>is</i> our Lord, and of great power: his understanding <i>is</i> infinite.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He giveth to the beast his food, <i>and</i> to the young ravens which cry.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He maketh peace <i>in</i> thy borders, <i>and</i> filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He sendeth forth his commandment <i>upon</i> earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, <i>and</i> the waters flow.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He hath not dealt so with any nation: and <i>as for his</i> judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
