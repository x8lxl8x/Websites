# I Samuel 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <i>that</i> he came down <i>with</i> an ephod in his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver <i>thee</i> up.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then David and his men, <i>which were</i> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <i>was</i> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> on the south of Jeshimon?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <i>shall be</i> to deliver him into the king's hand.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Saul said, Blessed <i>be</i> ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <i>and</i> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <i>that</i> he dealeth very subtilly.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <i>were</i> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Saul also and his men went to seek <i>him</i>. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <i>that</i>, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.</p>
