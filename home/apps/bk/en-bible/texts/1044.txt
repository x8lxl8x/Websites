# Acts 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Especially <i>because I know</i> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Unto which <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <i>God</i> day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even unto strange cities.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Delivering thee from the people, and <i>from</i> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; To open their eyes, <i>and</i> to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; That Christ should suffer, <i>and</i> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
