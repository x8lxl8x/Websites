# Ecclesiastes 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <i>such as were</i> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <i>there was</i> power; but they had no comforter.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea, better <i>is he</i> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <i>is</i> also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> an handful <i>with</i> quietness, than both the hands full <i>with</i> travail and vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; There is one <i>alone</i>, and <i>there is</i> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <i>is there</i> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <i>saith he</i>, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This <i>is</i> also vanity, yea, it <i>is</i> a sore travail.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Two <i>are</i> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <i>that is</i> alone when he falleth; for <i>he hath</i> not another to help him up.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <i>alone</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <i>he that is</i> born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no end of all the people, <i>even</i> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
