# Proverbs 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <i>is</i> before thee:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <i>are</i> deceitful meat.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <i>riches</i> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Eat thou not the bread of <i>him that hath</i> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For as he thinketh in his heart, so <i>is</i> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <i>is</i> not with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The morsel <i>which</i> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For their redeemer <i>is</i> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Withhold not correction from the child: for <i>if</i> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <i>be thou</i> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <i>a man</i> with rags.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Buy the truth, and sell <i>it</i> not; <i>also</i> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <i>child</i> shall have joy of him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For a whore <i>is</i> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <i>is</i> a narrow pit.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; She also lieth in wait as <i>for</i> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <i>when</i> it moveth itself aright.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; They have stricken me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
