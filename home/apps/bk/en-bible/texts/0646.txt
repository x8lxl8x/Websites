# Proverbs 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <i>and</i> intermeddleth with all wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When the wicked cometh, <i>then</i> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The words of a man's mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters, <i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>It is</i> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; A fool's mouth <i>is</i> his destruction, and his lips <i>are</i> the snare of his soul.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The name of the LORD <i>is</i> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He that answereth a matter before he heareth <i>it</i>, it <i>is</i> folly and shame unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city: and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <i>and</i> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Death and life <i>are</i> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>Whoso</i> findeth a wife findeth a good <i>thing</i>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; A man <i>that hath</i> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <i>that</i> sticketh closer than a brother.</p>
