# Song of Solomon 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs <i>are</i> like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thy navel <i>is like</i> a round goblet, <i>which</i> wanteth not liquor: thy belly <i>is like</i> an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thy two breasts <i>are</i> like two young roes <i>that are</i> twins.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thy neck <i>is</i> as a tower of ivory; thine eyes <i>like</i> the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose <i>is</i> as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thine head upon thee <i>is</i> like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king <i>is</i> held in the galleries.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters <i>of grapes</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth <i>down</i> sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I <i>am</i> my beloved's, and his desire <i>is</i> toward me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, <i>whether</i> the tender grape appear, <i>and</i> the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates <i>are</i> all manner of pleasant <i>fruits</i>, new and old, <i>which</i> I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</p>
