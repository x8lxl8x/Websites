# Exodus 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, <i>there shall</i> no blood <i>be shed</i> for him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If the sun be risen upon him, <i>there shall be</i> blood <i>shed</i> for him; <i>for</i> he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed <i>therewith</i>; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, <i>to see</i> whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For all manner of trespass, <i>whether it be</i> for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, <i>or</i> for any manner of lost thing, which <i>another</i> challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; <i>and</i> whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing <i>it</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>Then</i> shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept <i>thereof</i>, and he shall not make <i>it</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If it be torn in pieces, <i>then</i> let him bring it <i>for</i> witness, <i>and</i> he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if a man borrow <i>ought</i> of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof <i>being</i> not with it, he shall surely make <i>it</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>But</i> if the owner thereof <i>be</i> with it, he shall not make <i>it</i> good: if it <i>be</i> an hired <i>thing</i>, it came for his hire.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He that sacrificeth unto <i>any</i> god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; If thou lend money to <i>any of</i> my people <i>that is</i> poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For that <i>is</i> his covering only, it <i>is</i> his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I <i>am</i> gracious.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Thou shalt not delay <i>to offer</i> the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, <i>and</i> with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat <i>any</i> flesh <i>that is</i> torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
