# Proverbs 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A false balance <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but a just weight <i>is</i> his delight.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>When</i> pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly <i>is</i> wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in <i>their own</i> naughtiness.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When a wicked man dieth, <i>his</i> expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust <i>men</i> perisheth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; An hypocrite with <i>his</i> mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, <i>there is</i> shouting.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Where no counsel <i>is</i>, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <i>for it</i>: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <i>men</i> retain riches.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but <i>he that is</i> cruel troubleth his own flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <i>shall be</i> a sure reward.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; As righteousness <i>tendeth</i> to life: so he that pursueth evil <i>pursueth it</i> to his own death.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They that are of a froward heart <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD: but <i>such as are</i> upright in <i>their</i> way <i>are</i> his delight.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>Though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>As</i> a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, <i>so is</i> a fair woman which is without discretion.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The desire of the righteous <i>is</i> only good: <i>but</i> the expectation of the wicked <i>is</i> wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and <i>there is</i> that withholdeth more than is meet, but <i>it tendeth</i> to poverty.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing <i>shall be</i> upon the head of him that selleth <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool <i>shall be</i> servant to the wise of heart.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The fruit of the righteous <i>is</i> a tree of life; and he that winneth souls <i>is</i> wise.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>
