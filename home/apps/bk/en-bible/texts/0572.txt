# Psalms 94

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>How long</i> shall they utter <i>and</i> speak hard things? <i>and</i> all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Understand, ye brutish among the people: and <i>ye</i> fools, when will ye be wise?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, <i>shall not he know</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they <i>are</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? <i>or</i> who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Unless the LORD <i>had been</i> my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But the LORD is my defence; and my God <i>is</i> the rock of my refuge.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; <i>yea</i>, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</p>
