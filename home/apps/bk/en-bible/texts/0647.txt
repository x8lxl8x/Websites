# Proverbs 19

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <i>he that is</i> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Also, <i>that</i> the soul <i>be</i> without knowledge, <i>it is</i> not good; and he that hasteth with <i>his</i> feet sinneth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man <i>is</i> a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth <i>them with</i> words, <i>yet</i> they <i>are</i> wanting <i>to him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <i>it is</i> his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The king's wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; A foolish son <i>is</i> the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife <i>are</i> a continual dropping.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; House and riches <i>are</i> the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife <i>is</i> from the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; <i>but</i> he that despiseth his ways shall die.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver <i>him</i>, yet thou must do it again.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>There are</i> many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The desire of a man <i>is</i> his kindness: and a poor man <i>is</i> better than a liar.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>tendeth</i> to life: and <i>he that hath it</i> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; A slothful <i>man</i> hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, <i>and</i> he will understand knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He that wasteth <i>his</i> father, <i>and</i> chaseth away <i>his</i> mother, <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <i>that causeth</i> to err from the words of knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</p>
