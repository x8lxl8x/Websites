# Genesis 35

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that <i>were</i> with him, Put away the strange gods that <i>are</i> among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which <i>were</i> in their hand, and <i>all their</i> earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which <i>was</i> by Shechem.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that <i>were</i> round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; So Jacob came to Luz, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, that <i>is</i>, Bethel, he and all the people that <i>were</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And God said unto him, Thy name <i>is</i> Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And God said unto him, I <i>am</i> God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, <i>even</i> a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which <i>is</i> Bethlehem.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that <i>is</i> the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard <i>it</i>. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these <i>are</i> the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which <i>is</i> Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, <i>being</i> old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>
