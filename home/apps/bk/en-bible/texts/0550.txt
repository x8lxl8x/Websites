# Psalms 72

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> for Solomon.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers <i>that</i> water the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and <i>him</i> that hath no helper.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; <i>and</i> daily shall he be praised.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and <i>they</i> of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and <i>men</i> shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And blessed <i>be</i> his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled <i>with</i> his glory; Amen, and Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</p>
