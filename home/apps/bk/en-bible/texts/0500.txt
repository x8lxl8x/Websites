# Psalms 22

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <i>why art thou so</i> far from helping me, <i>and from</i> the words of my roaring?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But thou <i>art</i> holy, <i>O thou</i> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He trusted on the LORD <i>that</i> he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But thou <i>art</i> he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope <i>when I was</i> upon my mother's breasts.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <i>art</i> my God from my mother's belly.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Be not far from me; for trouble <i>is</i> near; for <i>there is</i> none to help.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Many bulls have compassed me: strong <i>bulls</i> of Bashan have beset me round.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They gaped upon me <i>with</i> their mouths, <i>as</i> a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I may tell all my bones: they look <i>and</i> stare upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; My praise <i>shall be</i> of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For the kingdom <i>is</i> the LORD'S: and he <i>is</i> the governor among the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; All <i>they that be</i> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done <i>this</i>.</p>
