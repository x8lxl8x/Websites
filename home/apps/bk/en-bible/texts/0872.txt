# Hosea 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Israel <i>is</i> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <i>that</i> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; It shall be also carried unto Assyria <i>for</i> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>As for</i> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>It is</i> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Ephraim <i>is as</i> an heifer <i>that is</i> taught, <i>and</i> loveth to tread out <i>the corn</i>; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <i>and</i> Jacob shall break his clods.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <i>it is</i> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <i>her</i> children.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</p>
