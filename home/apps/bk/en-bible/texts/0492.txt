# Psalms 14

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The fool hath said in his heart, <i>There is</i> no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, <i>there is</i> none that doeth good.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, <i>and</i> seek God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They are all gone aside, they are <i>all</i> together become filthy: <i>there is</i> none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <i>as</i> they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; There were they in great fear: for God <i>is</i> in the generation of the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD <i>is</i> his refuge.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Oh that the salvation of Israel <i>were come</i> out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <i>and</i> Israel shall be glad.</p>
