# Exodus 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt <i>already</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and mightier than we:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and <i>so</i> get them up out of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <i>was</i> with rigour.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see <i>them</i> upon the stools; if it <i>be</i> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it <i>be</i> a daughter, then she shall live.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not as the Egyptian women; for they <i>are</i> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>
