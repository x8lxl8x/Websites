# Zephaniah 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Before the decree bring forth, <i>before</i> the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD <i>is</i> against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the sea coast shall be dwellings <i>and</i> cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified <i>themselves</i> against their border.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore <i>as</i> I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, <i>even</i> the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified <i>themselves</i> against the people of the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD <i>will be</i> terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and <i>men</i> shall worship him, every one from his place, <i>even</i> all the isles of the heathen.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Ye Ethiopians also, ye <i>shall be</i> slain by my sword.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, <i>and</i> dry like a wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; <i>their</i> voice shall sing in the windows; desolation <i>shall be</i> in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I <i>am</i>, and <i>there is</i> none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, <i>and</i> wag his hand.</p>
