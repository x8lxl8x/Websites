# Psalms 143

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, <i>and</i> in thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul <i>thirsteth</i> after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Teach me to do thy will; for thou <i>art</i> my God: thy spirit <i>is</i> good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I <i>am</i> thy servant.</p>
