# Psalms 18

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i>that</i> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <i>and</i> my high tower.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I will call upon the LORD, <i>who is worthy</i> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <i>even</i> into his ears.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <i>were</i> dark waters <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; At the brightness <i>that was</i> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For all his judgments <i>were</i> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; <i>As for</i> God, his way <i>is</i> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <i>is</i> a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For who <i>is</i> God save the LORD? or who <i>is</i> a rock save our God?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; <i>It is</i> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He maketh my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; They cried, but <i>there was</i> none to save <i>them: even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <i>whom</i> I have not known shall serve me.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; <i>It is</i> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
