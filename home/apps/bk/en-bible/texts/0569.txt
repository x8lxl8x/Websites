# Psalms 91

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will say of the LORD, <i>He is</i> my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, <i>and</i> from the noisome pestilence.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth <i>shall be thy</i> shield and buckler.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; <i>nor</i> for the arrow <i>that</i> flieth by day;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Nor</i> for the pestilence <i>that</i> walketh in darkness; <i>nor</i> for the destruction <i>that</i> wasteth at noonday.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; <i>but</i> it shall not come nigh thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Because thou hast made the LORD, <i>which is</i> my refuge, <i>even</i> the most High, thy habitation;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They shall bear thee up in <i>their</i> hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I <i>will be</i> with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</p>
