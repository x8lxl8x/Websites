# Isaiah 62

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp <i>that</i> burneth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For <i>as</i> a young man marrieth a virgin, <i>so</i> shall thy sons marry thee: and <i>as</i> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, <i>so</i> shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, <i>which</i> shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn <i>to be</i> meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward <i>is</i> with him, and his work before him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.</p>
