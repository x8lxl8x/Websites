# Romans 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <i>whereof</i> to glory; but not before God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Saying</i>, Blessed <i>are</i> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Cometh</i> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <i>only</i>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had yet</i> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <i>he had</i> being <i>yet</i> uncircumcised.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <i>was</i> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For if they which are of the law <i>be</i> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <i>there is</i> no transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith, that <i>it might be</i> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <i>even</i> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p>
