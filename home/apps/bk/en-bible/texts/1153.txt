# I Peter 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <i>is</i> gracious.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; To whom coming, <i>as unto</i> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <i>and</i> precious,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Unto you therefore which believe <i>he is</i> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <i>even to them</i> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But ye <i>are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Which in time past <i>were</i> not a people, but <i>are</i> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Dearly beloved, I beseech <i>you</i> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by <i>your</i> good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; As free, and not using <i>your</i> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Honour all <i>men</i>. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Servants, <i>be</i> subject to <i>your</i> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For what glory <i>is it</i>, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <i>for it</i>, ye take it patiently, this <i>is</i> acceptable with God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <i>himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
