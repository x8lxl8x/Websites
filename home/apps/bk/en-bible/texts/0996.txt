# Luke 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <i>fellow</i> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <i>to</i> the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i>season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <i>him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I will therefore chastise him, and release <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <i>man</i>, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But they cried, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <i>him</i> go.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i>him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And, behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <i>and he was</i> a good man, and a just:</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <i>he was</i> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; This <i>man</i> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>
