# Song of Solomon 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair, my love; behold, thou <i>art</i> fair; thou <i>hast</i> doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair <i>is</i> as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thy teeth <i>are</i> like a flock <i>of sheep that are even</i> shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none <i>is</i> barren among them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thy lips <i>are</i> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech <i>is</i> comely: thy temples <i>are</i> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thy neck <i>is</i> like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thy two breasts <i>are</i> like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> all fair, my love; <i>there is</i> no spot in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Come with me from Lebanon, <i>my</i> spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; How fair is thy love, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thy lips, O <i>my</i> spouse, drop <i>as</i> the honeycomb: honey and milk <i>are</i> under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments <i>is</i> like the smell of Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; A garden inclosed <i>is</i> my sister, <i>my</i> spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy plants <i>are</i> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, <i>that</i> the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</p>
