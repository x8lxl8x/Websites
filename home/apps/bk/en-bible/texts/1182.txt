# Revelation 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <i>and</i> over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <i>are</i> thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true <i>are</i> thy ways, thou King of saints.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for <i>thou</i> only <i>art</i> holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p>
