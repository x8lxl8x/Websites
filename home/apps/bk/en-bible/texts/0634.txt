# Proverbs 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter</i>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Bind them continually upon thine heart, <i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; <i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But <i>if</i> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; <i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <i>that</i> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
