# Proverbs 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The king's heart <i>is</i> in the hand of the LORD, <i>as</i> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Every way of a man <i>is</i> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; To do justice and judgment <i>is</i> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; An high look, and a proud heart, <i>and</i> the plowing of the wicked, <i>is</i> sin.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The thoughts of the diligent <i>tend</i> only to plenteousness; but of every one <i>that is</i> hasty only to want.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>It is</i> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He that loveth pleasure <i>shall be</i> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The wicked <i>shall be</i> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>There is</i> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Proud <i>and</i> haughty scorner <i>is</i> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination: how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <i>as for</i> the upright, he directeth his way.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The horse <i>is</i> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>
