# Psalms 58

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Their poison <i>is</i> like the poison of a serpent: <i>they are</i> like the deaf adder <i>that</i> stoppeth her ear;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Let them melt away as waters <i>which</i> run continually: <i>when</i> he bendeth <i>his bow to shoot</i> his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; As a snail <i>which</i> melteth, let <i>every one of them</i> pass away: <i>like</i> the untimely birth of a woman, <i>that</i> they may not see the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <i>his</i> wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; So that a man shall say, Verily <i>there is</i> a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>
