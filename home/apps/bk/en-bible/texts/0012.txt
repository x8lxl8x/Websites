# Genesis 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram <i>was</i> seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite <i>was</i> then in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, <i>having</i> Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine <i>was</i> grievous in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou <i>art</i> a fair woman to look upon:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This <i>is</i> his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Say, I pray thee, thou <i>art</i> my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she <i>was</i> very fair.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she <i>was</i> thy wife?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Why saidst thou, She <i>is</i> my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take <i>her</i>, and go thy way.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Pharaoh commanded <i>his</i> men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
