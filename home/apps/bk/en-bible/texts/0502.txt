# Psalms 24

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The earth <i>is</i> the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift <i>them</i> up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he <i>is</i> the King of glory. Selah.</p>
