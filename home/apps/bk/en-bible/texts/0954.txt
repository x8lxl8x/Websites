# Matthew 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so</i>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i>thee</i>? or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink?</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>
