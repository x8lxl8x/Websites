# Hebrews 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <i>in</i> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <i>so many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <i>them</i>, and embraced <i>them</i>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And truly, if they had been mindful of that <i>country</i> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But now they desire a better <i>country</i>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Accounting that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <i>leaning</i> upon the top of his staff.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <i>land</i>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <i>of</i> Barak, and <i>of</i> Samson, and <i>of</i> Jephthae; <i>of</i> David also, and Samuel, and <i>of</i> the prophets:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And others had trial of <i>cruel</i> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <i>in</i> mountains, and <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p>
