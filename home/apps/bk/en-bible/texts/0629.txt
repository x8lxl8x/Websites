# Proverbs 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>
