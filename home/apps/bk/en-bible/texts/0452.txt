# Job 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I have heard many such things: miserable comforters <i>are</i> ye all.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I also could speak as ye <i>do</i>: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>But</i> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage <i>your grief</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and <i>though</i> I forbear, what am I eased?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <i>which</i> is a witness <i>against me</i>: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He teareth <i>me</i> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken <i>me</i> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids <i>is</i> the shadow of death;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Not for <i>any</i> injustice in mine hands: also my prayer <i>is</i> pure.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Also now, behold, my witness <i>is</i> in heaven, and my record <i>is</i> on high.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My friends scorn me: <i>but</i> mine eye poureth out <i>tears</i> unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man <i>pleadeth</i> for his neighbour!</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; When a few years are come, then I shall go the way <i>whence</i> I shall not return.</p>
