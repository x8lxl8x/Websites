# Hebrews 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <i>them</i> slip.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard <i>him</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; God also bearing <i>them</i> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <i>that is</i> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For it became him, for whom <i>are</i> all things, and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <i>are</i> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For verily he took not on <i>him the nature of</i> angels; but he took on <i>him</i> the seed of Abraham.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <i>his</i> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p>
