# Psalms 137

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us <i>required of us</i> mirth, <i>saying</i>, Sing us <i>one</i> of the songs of Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <i>her cunning</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <i>it</i>, rase <i>it, even</i> to the foundation thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <i>shall he be</i>, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Happy <i>shall he be</i>, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</p>
