# Jonah 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, <i>was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made <i>it</i> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <i>even</i> unto death.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <i>also</i> much cattle?</p>
