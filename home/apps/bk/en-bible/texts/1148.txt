# James 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>the Lord</i> of glory, with respect of persons.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i>point</i>, he is guilty of all.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; What <i>doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <i>ye</i> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <i>doth it</i> profit?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <i>them</i> out another way?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
