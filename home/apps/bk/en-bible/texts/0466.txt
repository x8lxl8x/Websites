# Job 30

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But now <i>they that are</i> younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Yea, whereto <i>might</i> the strength of their hands <i>profit</i> me, in whom old age was perished?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For want and famine <i>they were</i> solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots <i>for</i> their meat.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They were driven forth from among <i>men</i>, (they cried after them as <i>after</i> a thief;)</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, <i>in</i> caves of the earth, and <i>in</i> the rocks.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>They were</i> children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Upon <i>my</i> right <i>hand</i> rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They came <i>upon me</i> as a wide breaking in <i>of waters</i>: in the desolation they rolled themselves <i>upon me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; By the great force <i>of my disease</i> is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride <i>upon it</i>, and dissolvest my substance.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For I know <i>that</i> thou wilt bring me <i>to</i> death, and <i>to</i> the house appointed for all living.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Howbeit he will not stretch out <i>his</i> hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was <i>not</i> my soul grieved for the poor?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; When I looked for good, then evil came <i>unto me</i>: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, <i>and</i> I cried in the congregation.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; My harp also is <i>turned</i> to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</p>
