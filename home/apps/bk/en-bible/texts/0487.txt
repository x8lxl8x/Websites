# Psalms 9

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will praise <i>thee</i>, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i>which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i>that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The LORD is known <i>by</i> the judgment <i>which</i> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The wicked shall be turned into hell, <i>and</i> all the nations that forget God.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <i>not</i> perish for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Put them in fear, O LORD: <i>that</i> the nations may know themselves <i>to be but</i> men. Selah.</p>
