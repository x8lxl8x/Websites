# Psalms 29

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The voice of the LORD <i>is</i> upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD <i>is</i> upon many waters.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The voice of the LORD <i>is</i> powerful; the voice of the LORD <i>is</i> full of majesty.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of <i>his</i> glory.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.</p>
