# Psalms 31

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou <i>art</i> my strength.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <i>yea</i>, my soul and my belly.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I have heard the slander of many: fear <i>was</i> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <i>art</i> my God.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My times <i>are</i> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, <i>and</i> let them be silent in the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>Oh</i> how great <i>is</i> thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; <i>which</i> thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; O love the LORD, all ye his saints: <i>for</i> the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</p>
