# Revelation 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <i>which is</i> new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and <i>I will write upon him</i> my new name.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <i>that</i> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
