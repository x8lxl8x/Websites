# Psalms 132

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, <i>and</i> all his afflictions:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How he sware unto the LORD, <i>and</i> vowed unto the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, <i>or</i> slumber to mine eyelids,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD hath sworn <i>in</i> truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired <i>it</i> for his habitation.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; This <i>is</i> my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>
