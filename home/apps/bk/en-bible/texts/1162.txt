# I John 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Not as Cain, <i>who</i> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <i>his</i> brother abideth in death.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</p>
