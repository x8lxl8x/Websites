# Genesis 44

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks <i>with</i> food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>And</i> when they were gone out of the city, <i>and</i> not <i>yet</i> far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not this <i>it</i> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he said, Now also <i>let</i> it <i>be</i> according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he searched, <i>and</i> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he <i>was</i> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Joseph said unto them, What deed <i>is</i> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we <i>are</i> my lord's servants, both we, and <i>he</i> also with whom the cup is found.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said, God forbid that I should do so: <i>but</i> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou <i>art</i> even as Pharaoh.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for <i>if</i> he should leave his father, <i>his father</i> would die.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And our father said, Go again, <i>and</i> buy us a little food.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother <i>be</i> with us.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two <i>sons</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad <i>be</i> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad <i>is</i> not <i>with us</i>, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad <i>be</i> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>
