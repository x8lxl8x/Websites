# II Corinthians 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; We then, <i>as</i> workers together <i>with him</i>, beseech <i>you</i> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <i>is</i> the accepted time; behold, now <i>is</i> the day of salvation.)</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But in all <i>things</i> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <i>yet</i> true;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; As unknown, and <i>yet</i> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i>yet</i> possessing all things.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; O <i>ye</i> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <i>my</i> children,) be ye also enlarged.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <i>them</i>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <i>thing</i>; and I will receive you,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
