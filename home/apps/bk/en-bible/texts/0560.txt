# Psalms 82

<p class="intro">A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Deliver the poor and needy: rid <i>them</i> out of the hand of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have said, Ye <i>are</i> gods; and all of you <i>are</i> children of the most High.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>
