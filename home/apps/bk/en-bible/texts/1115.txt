# I Thessalonians 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <i>you</i> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <i>so</i> ye would abound more and more.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For this is the will of God, <i>even</i> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That no <i>man</i> go beyond and defraud his brother in <i>any</i> matter: because that the Lord <i>is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <i>that</i> ye may have lack of nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <i>and</i> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then we which are alive <i>and</i> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
