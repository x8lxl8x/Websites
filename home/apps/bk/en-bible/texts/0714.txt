# Isaiah 35

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, <i>and</i> the excellency of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Say to them <i>that are</i> of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come <i>with</i> vengeance, <i>even</i> God <i>with</i> a recompence; he will come and save you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then shall the lame <i>man</i> leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, <i>shall be</i> grass with reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it <i>shall be</i> for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err <i>therein</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; No lion shall be there, nor <i>any</i> ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk <i>there</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>
