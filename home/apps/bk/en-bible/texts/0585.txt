# Psalms 107

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD, for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let the redeemed of the LORD say <i>so</i>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <i>being</i> bound in affliction and iron;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and <i>there was</i> none to help.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he saved them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <i>them</i> from their destructions.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <i>where there is</i> no way.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <i>him</i> families like a flock.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; The righteous shall see <i>it</i>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> wise, and will observe these <i>things</i>, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>
