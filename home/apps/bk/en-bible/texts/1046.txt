# Acts 28

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when the barbarians saw the <i>venomous</i> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i>us</i> with such things as were necessary.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i>there</i> three days.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But when the Jews spake against <i>it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i>you</i>, and to speak with <i>you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i>out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i>that</i> they will hear it.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
