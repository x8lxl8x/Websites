# Romans 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <i>her</i> husband.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; So then if, while <i>her</i> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <i>even</i> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <i>was</i> dead.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the commandment, which <i>was ordained</i> to life, I found <i>to be</i> unto death.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <i>it is</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <i>how</i> to perform that which is good I find not.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
