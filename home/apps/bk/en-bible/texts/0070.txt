# Exodus 20

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And God spake all these words, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness <i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the water under the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God <i>am</i> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of the LORD thy God: <i>in it</i> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that <i>is</i> within thy gates:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For <i>in</i> six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them <i>is</i>, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou shalt not steal.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that <i>is</i> thy neighbour's.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw <i>it</i>, they removed, and stood afar off.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God <i>was</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p>
