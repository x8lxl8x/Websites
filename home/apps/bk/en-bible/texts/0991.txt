# Luke 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end</i>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i>his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <i>his</i> disciples saw <i>it</i>, they rebuked them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But Jesus called them <i>unto him</i>, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none <i>is</i> good, save one, <i>that is</i>, God.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And they that heard <i>it</i> said, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Then he took <i>unto him</i> the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And they shall scourge <i>him</i>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he cried, saying, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <i>Thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <i>it</i>, gave praise unto God.</p>
