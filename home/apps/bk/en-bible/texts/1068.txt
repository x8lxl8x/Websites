# I Corinthians 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <i>suffer yourselves to</i> be defrauded?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <i>your</i> brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <i>is</i> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <i>them</i> the members of an harlot? God forbid.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</p>
