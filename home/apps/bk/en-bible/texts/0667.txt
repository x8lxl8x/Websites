# Ecclesiastes 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> as the wise <i>man</i>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I <i>counsel thee</i> to keep the king's commandment, and <i>that</i> in regard of the oath of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <i>is</i> great upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <i>hath he</i> power in the day of death: and <i>there is</i> no discharge in <i>that</i> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <i>there is</i> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this <i>is</i> also vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <i>days</i> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which are</i> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <i>men</i>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <i>men</i>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also <i>is</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <i>there is that</i> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <i>it</i> out, yet he shall not find <i>it</i>; yea further; though a wise <i>man</i> think to know <i>it</i>, yet shall he not be able to find <i>it</i>.</p>
