# Ezekiel 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then said he unto me, Son of man, these <i>are</i> the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Which say, <i>It is</i> not near; let us build houses: this <i>city is</i> the caldron, and we <i>be</i> the flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, <i>every one of</i> them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they <i>are</i> the flesh, and this <i>city is</i> the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; This <i>city</i> shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; <i>but</i> I will judge you in the border of Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that <i>are</i> round about you.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Son of man, thy brethren, <i>even</i> thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, <i>are</i> they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But <i>as for them</i> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which <i>is</i> on the east side of the city.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</p>
