# James 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; From whence <i>come</i> wars and fightings among you? <i>come they</i> not hence, <i>even</i> of your lusts that war in your members?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume <i>it</i> upon your lusts.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <i>your</i> hands, <i>ye</i> sinners; and purify <i>your</i> hearts, <i>ye</i> double minded.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and <i>your</i> joy to heaviness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of <i>his</i> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Whereas ye know not what <i>shall be</i> on the morrow. For what <i>is</i> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For that ye <i>ought</i> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <i>it</i> not, to him it is sin.</p>
