# Psalms 11

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <i>as</i> a bird to your mountain?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For, lo, the wicked bend <i>their</i> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne <i>is</i> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <i>this shall be</i> the portion of their cup.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
