# I Samuel 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: <i>they were</i> judges in Beersheba.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint <i>them</i> for himself, for his chariots, and <i>to be</i> his horsemen; and <i>some</i> shall run before his chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and <i>will set them</i> to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he will take your daughters <i>to be</i> confectionaries, and <i>to be</i> cooks, and <i>to be</i> bakers.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, <i>even</i> the best <i>of them</i>, and give <i>them</i> to his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put <i>them</i> to his work.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>
