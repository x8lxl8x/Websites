# Isaiah 61

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The Spirit of the Lord GOD <i>is</i> upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to <i>them that are</i> bound;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <i>shall be</i> your plowmen and your vinedressers.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: <i>men</i> shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For your shame <i>ye shall have</i> double; and <i>for</i> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they <i>are</i> the seed <i>which</i> the LORD hath blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh <i>himself</i> with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth <i>herself</i> with her jewels.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</p>
