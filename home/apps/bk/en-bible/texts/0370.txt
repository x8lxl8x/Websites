# II Chronicles 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where <i>the LORD</i> appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he began to build in the second <i>day</i> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Now these <i>are the things wherein</i> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure <i>was</i> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the porch that <i>was</i> in the front <i>of the house</i>, the length <i>of it was</i> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold <i>was</i> gold of Parvaim.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he made the most holy house, the length whereof <i>was</i> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, <i>amounting</i> to six hundred talents.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the weight of the nails <i>was</i> fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the wings of the cherubims <i>were</i> twenty cubits long: one wing <i>of the one cherub was</i> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <i>was likewise</i> five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And <i>one</i> wing of the other cherub <i>was</i> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <i>was</i> five cubits <i>also</i>, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces <i>were</i> inward.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he made the vail <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that <i>was</i> on the top of each of them <i>was</i> five cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he made chains, <i>as</i> in the oracle, and put <i>them</i> on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put <i>them</i> on the chains.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</p>
