# Psalms 99

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth <i>between</i> the cherubims; let the earth be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> great in Zion; and he <i>is</i> high above all the people.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let them praise thy great and terrible name; <i>for</i> it <i>is</i> holy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; <i>for</i> he <i>is</i> holy.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance <i>that</i> he gave them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God <i>is</i> holy.</p>
