# Job 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Lo, mine eye hath seen all <i>this</i>, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; What ye know, <i>the same</i> do I know also: I <i>am</i> not inferior unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But ye <i>are</i> forgers of lies, ye <i>are</i> all physicians of no value.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye <i>so</i> mock him?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Your remembrances <i>are</i> like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what <i>will</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He also <i>shall be</i> my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Behold now, I have ordered <i>my</i> cause; I know that I shall be justified.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Only do not two <i>things</i> unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; How many <i>are</i> mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</p>
