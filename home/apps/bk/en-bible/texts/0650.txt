# Proverbs 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches, <i>and</i> loving favour rather than silver and gold.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <i>is</i> the maker of them all.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He that loveth pureness of heart, <i>for</i> the grace of his lips the king <i>shall be</i> his friend.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Foolishness <i>is</i> bound in the heart of a child; <i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <i>riches, and</i> he that giveth to the rich, <i>shall</i> surely <i>come</i> to want.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For <i>it is</i> a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Rob not the poor, because he <i>is</i> poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Be not thou <i>one</i> of them that strike hands, <i>or</i> of them that are sureties for debts.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean <i>men</i>.</p>
