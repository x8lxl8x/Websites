# II Corinthians 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <i>my</i> folly: and indeed bear with me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i>you as</i> a chaste virgin to Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <i>if</i> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But though <i>I be</i> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I robbed other churches, taking wages <i>of them</i>, to do you service.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <i>things</i> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <i>so</i> will I keep <i>myself</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For such <i>are</i> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Therefore <i>it is</i> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That which I speak, I speak <i>it</i> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <i>yourselves</i> are wise.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <i>you</i>, if a man take <i>of you</i>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Are they Hebrews? so <i>am</i> I. Are they Israelites? so <i>am</i> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <i>am</i> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Of the Jews five times received I forty <i>stripes</i> save one.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>In</i> journeyings often, <i>in</i> perils of waters, <i>in</i> perils of robbers, <i>in</i> perils by <i>mine own</i> countrymen, <i>in</i> perils by the heathen, <i>in</i> perils in the city, <i>in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i>in</i> perils in the sea, <i>in</i> perils among false brethren;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</p>
