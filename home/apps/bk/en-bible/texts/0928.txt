# Malachi 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he <i>is</i> like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he shall sit <i>as</i> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in <i>his</i> wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <i>from his right</i>, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept <i>them</i>. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Ye <i>are</i> cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, <i>even</i> this whole nation.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that <i>there shall</i> not <i>be room</i> enough <i>to receive it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken <i>so much</i> against thee?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Ye have said, It <i>is</i> vain to serve God: and what profit <i>is it</i> that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, <i>they that</i> tempt God are even delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard <i>it</i>, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</p>
