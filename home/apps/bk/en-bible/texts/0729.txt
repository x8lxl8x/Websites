# Isaiah 50

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Where <i>is</i> the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors <i>is it</i> to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Wherefore, when I came, <i>was there</i> no man? when I called, <i>was there</i> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because <i>there is</i> no water, and dieth for thirst.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <i>him that is</i> weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>He is</i> near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who <i>is</i> mine adversary? let him come near to me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh <i>in</i> darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass <i>yourselves</i> about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks <i>that</i> ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.</p>
