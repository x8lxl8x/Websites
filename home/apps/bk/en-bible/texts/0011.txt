# Genesis 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top <i>may reach</i> unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the LORD said, Behold, the people <i>is</i> one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the generations of Shem: Shem <i>was</i> an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife <i>was</i> Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But Sarai was barren; she <i>had</i> no child.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p>
