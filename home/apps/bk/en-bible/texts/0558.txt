# Psalms 80

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims, shine forth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <i>and</i> save us.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou preparedst <i>room</i> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <i>were like</i> the goodly cedars.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Why hast thou <i>then</i> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <i>that</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>It is</i> burned with fire, <i>it is</i> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man <i>whom</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
