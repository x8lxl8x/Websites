# Psalms 75

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Altaschith, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, <i>unto thee</i> do we give thanks: for <i>that</i> thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Lift not up your horn on high: speak <i>not with</i> a stiff neck.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For promotion <i>cometh</i> neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But God <i>is</i> the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For in the hand of the LORD <i>there is</i> a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring <i>them</i> out, <i>and</i> drink <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; <i>but</i> the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.</p>
