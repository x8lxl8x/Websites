# Galatians 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; This persuasion <i>cometh</i> not of him that calleth you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <i>use</i> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>This</i> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <i>these</i>; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <i>you</i> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
