# Psalms 83

<p class="intro">A Song <i>or</i> Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <i>being</i> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Do unto them as <i>unto</i> the Midianites; as <i>to</i> Sisera, as <i>to</i> Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Which</i> perished at Endor: they became <i>as</i> dung for the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; That <i>men</i> may know that thou, whose name alone <i>is</i> JEHOVAH, <i>art</i> the most high over all the earth.</p>
