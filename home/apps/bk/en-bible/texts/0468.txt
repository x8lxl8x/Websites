# Job 32

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he <i>was</i> righteous in his own eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and <i>yet</i> had condemned Job.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they <i>were</i> elder than he.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; When Elihu saw that <i>there was</i> no answer in the mouth of <i>these</i> three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <i>am</i> young, and ye <i>are</i> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But <i>there is</i> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Great men are not <i>always</i> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <i>there was</i> none of you that convinced Job, <i>or</i> that answered his words:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now he hath not directed <i>his</i> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <i>and</i> answered no more;)</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>I said</i>, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Behold, my belly <i>is</i> as wine <i>which</i> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For I know not to give flattering titles; <i>in so doing</i> my maker would soon take me away.</p>
