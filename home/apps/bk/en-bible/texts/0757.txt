# Jeremiah 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Righteous <i>art</i> thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of <i>thy</i> judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? <i>wherefore</i> are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <i>art</i> near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <i>if</i> in the land of peace, <i>wherein</i> thou trustedst, <i>they wearied thee</i>, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Mine heritage <i>is</i> unto me <i>as</i> a speckled bird, the birds round about <i>are</i> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They have made it desolate, <i>and being</i> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth <i>it</i> to heart.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <i>one</i> end of the land even to the <i>other</i> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, <i>but</i> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.</p>
