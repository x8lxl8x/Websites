# Micah 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <i>and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <i>or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <i>for</i> my transgression, the fruit of my body <i>for</i> the sin of my soul?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He hath shewed thee, O man, what <i>is</i> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and <i>the man of</i> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <i>that is</i> abominable?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <i>is</i> deceitful in their mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i>shall be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>
