# Proverbs 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My son, attend unto my wisdom, <i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
