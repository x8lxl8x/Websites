# Genesis 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>That these</i> made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that <i>were</i> with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which <i>is</i> by the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which <i>is</i> Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same <i>is</i> Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the vale of Siddim <i>was full of</i> slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these <i>were</i> confederate with Abram.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained <i>servants</i>, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued <i>them</i> unto Dan.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which <i>is</i> on the left hand of Damascus.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that <i>were</i> with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which <i>is</i> the king's dale.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he <i>was</i> the priest of the most high God.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he blessed him, and said, Blessed <i>be</i> Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; That I will not <i>take</i> from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that <i>is</i> thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.</p>
