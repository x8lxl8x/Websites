# Isaiah 53

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, <i>there is</i> no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were <i>our</i> faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But he <i>was</i> wounded for our transgressions, <i>he was</i> bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace <i>was</i> upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither <i>was any</i> deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <i>him</i> to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <i>his</i> seed, he shall prolong <i>his</i> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He shall see of the travail of his soul, <i>and</i> shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore will I divide him <i>a portion</i> with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
