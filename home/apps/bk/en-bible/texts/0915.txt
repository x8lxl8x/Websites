# Zechariah 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <i>of</i> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <i>are</i> upon the top thereof:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <i>side</i> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <i>side</i> thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <i>is</i> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Who <i>art</i> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <i>thou shalt become</i> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <i>thereof with</i> shoutings, <i>crying</i>, Grace, grace unto it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <i>with</i> those seven; they <i>are</i> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then answered I, and said unto him, What <i>are</i> these two olive trees upon the right <i>side</i> of the candlestick and upon the left <i>side</i> thereof?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I answered again, and said unto him, What <i>be these</i> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <i>oil</i> out of themselves?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <i>be</i>? And I said, No, my lord.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then said he, These <i>are</i> the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
