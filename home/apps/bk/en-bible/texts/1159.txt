# II Peter 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i>both</i> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they were</i> from the beginning of the creation.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i>is</i> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>Seeing</i> then <i>that</i> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner <i>of persons</i> ought ye to be in <i>all</i> holy conversation and godliness,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And account <i>that</i> the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is</i> salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; As also in all <i>his</i> epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as <i>they do</i> also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <i>these things</i> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But grow in grace, and <i>in</i> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <i>be</i> glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
