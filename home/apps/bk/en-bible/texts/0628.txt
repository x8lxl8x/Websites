# Psalms 150

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
