# Psalms 110

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thy people <i>shall be</i> willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill <i>the places</i> with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>
