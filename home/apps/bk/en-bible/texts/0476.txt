# Job 40

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct <i>him</i>? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Deck thyself now <i>with</i> majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one <i>that is</i> proud, and abase him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Look on every one <i>that is</i> proud, <i>and</i> bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Hide them in the dust together; <i>and</i> bind their faces in secret.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins, and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; His bones <i>are as</i> strong pieces of brass; his bones <i>are</i> like bars of iron.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He <i>is</i> the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach <i>unto him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The shady trees cover him <i>with</i> their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Behold, he drinketh up a river, <i>and</i> hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He taketh it with his eyes: <i>his</i> nose pierceth through snares.</p>
