# Isaiah 41

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew <i>their</i> strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who raised up the righteous <i>man</i> from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made <i>him</i> rule over kings? he gave <i>them</i> as the dust to his sword, <i>and</i> as driven stubble to his bow.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He pursued them, <i>and</i> passed safely; <i>even</i> by the way <i>that</i> he had not gone with his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who hath wrought and done <i>it</i>, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I <i>am</i> he.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The isles saw <i>it</i>, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They helped every one his neighbour; and <i>every one</i> said to his brother, Be of good courage.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, <i>and</i> he that smootheth <i>with</i> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It <i>is</i> ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, <i>that</i> it should not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But thou, Israel, <i>art</i> my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Thou</i> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou <i>art</i> my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Fear thou not; for I <i>am</i> with thee: be not dismayed; for I <i>am</i> thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, <i>even</i> them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Fear not, thou worm Jacob, <i>and</i> ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat <i>them</i> small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, <i>and</i> shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>When</i> the poor and needy seek water, and <i>there is</i> none, <i>and</i> their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, <i>and</i> the pine, and the box tree together:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong <i>reasons</i>, saith the King of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Let them bring <i>them</i> forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they <i>be</i>, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye <i>are</i> gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold <i>it</i> together.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Behold, ye <i>are</i> of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination <i>is he that</i> chooseth you.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I have raised up <i>one</i> from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as <i>upon</i> morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, <i>He is</i> righteous? yea, <i>there is</i> none that sheweth, yea, <i>there is</i> none that declareth, yea, <i>there is</i> none that heareth your words.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The first <i>shall say</i> to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For I beheld, and <i>there was</i> no man; even among them, and <i>there was</i> no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Behold, they <i>are</i> all vanity; their works <i>are</i> nothing: their molten images <i>are</i> wind and confusion.</p>
