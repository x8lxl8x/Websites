# Ezekiel 27

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <i>which art</i> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <i>am</i> of perfect beauty.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thy borders <i>are</i> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They have made all thy <i>ship</i> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Of</i> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <i>of</i> ivory, <i>brought</i> out of the isles of Chittim.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise <i>men</i>, O Tyrus, <i>that</i> were in thee, were thy pilots.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The ancients of Gebal and the wise <i>men</i> thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The men of Arvad with thine army <i>were</i> upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Tarshish <i>was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <i>kind of</i> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they <i>were</i> thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The men of Dedan <i>were</i> thy merchants; many isles <i>were</i> the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee <i>for</i> a present horns of ivory and ebony.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Syria <i>was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Judah, and the land of Israel, they <i>were</i> thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Damascus <i>was</i> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Dedan <i>was</i> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these <i>were they</i> thy merchants.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they <i>were</i> thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, <i>and</i> Chilmad, <i>were</i> thy merchants.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; These <i>were</i> thy merchants in all sorts <i>of things</i>, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that <i>are</i> in thee, and in all thy company which <i>is</i> in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <i>and</i> all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart <i>and</i> bitter wailing.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, <i>saying</i>, What <i>city is</i> like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; In the time <i>when</i> thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in <i>their</i> countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never <i>shalt be</i> any more.</p>
