# Isaiah 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For it shall be, <i>that</i>, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, <i>so</i> the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; We have heard of the pride of Moab; <i>he is</i> very proud: <i>even</i> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: <i>but</i> his lies <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely <i>they are</i> stricken.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the fields of Heshbon languish, <i>and</i> the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come <i>even</i> unto Jazer, they wandered <i>through</i> the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in <i>their</i> presses; I have made <i>their vintage</i> shouting to cease.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant <i>shall be</i> very small <i>and</i> feeble.</p>
