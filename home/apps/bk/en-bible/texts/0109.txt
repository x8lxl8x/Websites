# Leviticus 19

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God <i>am</i> holy.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it <i>is</i> abominable; it shall not be accepted.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore <i>every one</i> that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather <i>every</i> grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob <i>him</i>: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: <i>but</i> in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou shalt not go up and down <i>as</i> a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that <i>is</i> a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>even</i> a ram for a trespass offering.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD <i>withal</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Ye shall not eat <i>any thing</i> with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; <i>But</i> the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>
