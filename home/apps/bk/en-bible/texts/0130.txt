# Numbers 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men <i>were</i> heads of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And these <i>were</i> their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Of the tribe of Joseph, <i>namely</i>, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this <i>way</i> southward, and go up into the mountain:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And see the land, what it <i>is</i>; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they <i>be</i> strong or weak, few or many;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And what the land <i>is</i> that they dwell in, whether it <i>be</i> good or bad; and what cities <i>they be</i> that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And what the land <i>is</i>, whether it <i>be</i> fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time <i>was</i> the time of the firstripe grapes.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, <i>were</i>. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and <i>they brought</i> of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this <i>is</i> the fruit of it.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Nevertheless the people <i>be</i> strong that dwell in the land, and the cities <i>are</i> walled, <i>and</i> very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they <i>are</i> stronger than we.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, <i>is</i> a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it <i>are</i> men of a great stature.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, <i>which come</i> of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p>
