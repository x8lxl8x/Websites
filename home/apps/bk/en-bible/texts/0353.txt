# I Chronicles 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <i>the place that</i> I have prepared for it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i>was</i> skilful.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And it came to pass, <i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>
