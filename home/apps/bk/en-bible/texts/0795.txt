# Jeremiah 50

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word that the LORD spake against Babylon <i>and</i> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <i>and</i> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <i>saying</i>, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <i>that</i> shall not be forgotten.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <i>on</i> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows <i>shall be</i> as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <i>shall be</i> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <i>is</i> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Israel <i>is</i> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <i>him</i> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <i>there shall be</i> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Go up against the land of Merathaim, <i>even</i> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; A sound of battle <i>is</i> in the land, and of great destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this <i>is</i> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, <i>O thou</i> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <i>that</i> I will visit thee.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah <i>were</i> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Their Redeemer <i>is</i> strong; the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; A sword <i>is</i> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; A sword <i>is</i> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword <i>is</i> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; A sword <i>is</i> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that <i>are</i> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword <i>is</i> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; A drought <i>is</i> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it <i>is</i> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon <i>their</i> idols.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell <i>there</i>, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <i>cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD; <i>so</i> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <i>are</i> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, <i>every one</i> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <i>and</i> pangs as of a woman in travail.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who <i>is</i> a chosen <i>man, that</i> I may appoint over her? for who <i>is</i> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <i>is</i> that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make <i>their</i> habitation desolate with them.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</p>
