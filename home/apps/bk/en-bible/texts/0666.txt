# Ecclesiastes 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A good name <i>is</i> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that <i>is</i> the end of all men; and the living will lay <i>it</i> to his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Sorrow <i>is</i> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The heart of the wise <i>is</i> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <i>is</i> in the house of mirth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <i>is</i> the laughter of the fool: this also <i>is</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <i>and</i> the patient in spirit <i>is</i> better than the proud in spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Say not thou, What is <i>the cause</i> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> good with an inheritance: and <i>by it there is</i> profit to them that see the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For wisdom <i>is</i> a defence, <i>and</i> money <i>is</i> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <i>is, that</i> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Consider the work of God: for who can make <i>that</i> straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All <i>things</i> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <i>man</i> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <i>man</i> that prolongeth <i>his life</i> in his wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>It is</i> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <i>men</i> which are in the city.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For <i>there is</i> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <i>was</i> far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <i>of things</i>, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <i>and</i> madness:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <i>is</i> snares and nets, <i>and</i> her hands <i>as</i> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <i>counting</i> one by one, to find out the account:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p>
