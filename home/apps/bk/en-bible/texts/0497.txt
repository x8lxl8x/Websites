# Psalms 19

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no speech nor language, <i>where</i> their voice is not heard.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Which <i>is</i> as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, <i>and</i> rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; His going forth <i>is</i> from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The law of the LORD <i>is</i> perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD <i>is</i> sure, making wise the simple.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The statutes of the LORD <i>are</i> right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD <i>is</i> pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD <i>are</i> true <i>and</i> righteous altogether.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; More to be desired <i>are they</i> than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Moreover by them is thy servant warned: <i>and</i> in keeping of them <i>there is</i> great reward.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Who can understand <i>his</i> errors? cleanse thou me from secret <i>faults</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous <i>sins</i>; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</p>
