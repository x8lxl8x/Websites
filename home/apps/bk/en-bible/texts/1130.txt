# Titus 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; To Titus, <i>mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; One of themselves, <i>even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i>are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Unto the pure all things <i>are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i>is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i>him</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
