# Micah 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <i>there is</i> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The good <i>man</i> is perished out of the earth: and <i>there is</i> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i>man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The best of them <i>is</i> as a brier: the most upright <i>is sharper</i> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <i>and</i> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies <i>are</i> the men of his own house.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <i>shall be</i> a light unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <i>and</i> I shall behold his righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then <i>she that is</i> mine enemy shall see <i>it</i>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>In</i> the day that thy walls are to be built, <i>in</i> that day shall the decree be far removed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>In</i> that day <i>also</i> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <i>from</i> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <i>from</i> mountain to mountain.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <i>in</i> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <i>in</i> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <i>their</i> hand upon <i>their</i> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <i>in</i> mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <i>and</i> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</p>
