# Isaiah 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will <i>God</i> appoint <i>for</i> walls and bulwarks.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou wilt keep <i>him</i> in perfect peace, <i>whose</i> mind <i>is</i> stayed <i>on thee</i>: because he trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> everlasting strength:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, <i>even</i> to the ground; he bringeth it <i>even</i> to the dust.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The foot shall tread it down, <i>even</i> the feet of the poor, <i>and</i> the steps of the needy.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The way of the just <i>is</i> uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of <i>our</i> soul <i>is</i> to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments <i>are</i> in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let favour be shewed to the wicked, <i>yet</i> will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; LORD, <i>when</i> thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: <i>but</i> they shall see, and be ashamed for <i>their</i> envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; O LORD our God, <i>other</i> lords beside thee have had dominion over us: <i>but</i> by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>They are</i> dead, they shall not live; <i>they are</i> deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed <i>it</i> far <i>unto</i> all the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer <i>when</i> thy chastening <i>was</i> upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Like as a woman with child, <i>that</i> draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, <i>and</i> crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thy dead <i>men</i> shall live, <i>together with</i> my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew <i>is as</i> the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</p>
