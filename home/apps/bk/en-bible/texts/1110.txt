# Colossians 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; When Christ, <i>who is</i> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And have put on the new <i>man</i>, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <i>nor</i> free: but Christ <i>is</i> all, and in all.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also <i>do</i> ye.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And above all these things <i>put on</i> charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <i>do</i> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Husbands, love <i>your</i> wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Children, obey <i>your</i> parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Fathers, provoke not your children <i>to anger</i>, lest they be discouraged.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Servants, obey in all things <i>your</i> masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And whatsoever ye do, do <i>it</i> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
