# Job 35

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Elihu spake moreover, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thinkest thou this to be right, <i>that</i> thou saidst, My righteousness <i>is</i> more than God's?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? <i>and</i>, What profit shall I have, <i>if I be cleansed</i> from my sin?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds <i>which</i> are higher than thou.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or <i>if</i> thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thy wickedness <i>may hurt</i> a man as thou <i>art</i>; and thy righteousness <i>may profit</i> the son of man.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make <i>the oppressed</i> to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But none saith, Where <i>is</i> God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, <i>yet</i> judgment <i>is</i> before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But now, because <i>it is</i> not <i>so</i>, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth <i>it</i> not in great extremity:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
