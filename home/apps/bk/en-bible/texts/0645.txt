# Proverbs 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <i>with</i> strife.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <i>and</i> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Children's children <i>are</i> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <i>are</i> their fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; A gift <i>is as</i> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <i>very</i> friends.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Wherefore <i>is there</i> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; A man void of understanding striketh hands, <i>and</i> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <i>and</i> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He that begetteth a fool <i>doeth it</i> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; A merry heart doeth good <i>like</i> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; A wicked <i>man</i> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <i>are</i> in the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; A foolish son <i>is</i> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Also to punish the just <i>is</i> not good, <i>nor</i> to strike princes for equity.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <i>and</i> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <i>and</i> he that shutteth his lips <i>is esteemed</i> a man of understanding.</p>
