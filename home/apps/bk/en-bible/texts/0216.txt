# Judges 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, <i>even</i> I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing <i>praise</i> to the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The mountains melted from before the LORD, <i>even</i> that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>The inhabitants of</i> the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They chose new gods; then <i>was</i> war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; My heart <i>is</i> toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>They that are delivered</i> from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, <i>even</i> the righteous acts <i>toward the inhabitants</i> of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Out of Ephraim <i>was there</i> a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the princes of Issachar <i>were</i> with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben <i>there were</i> great thoughts of heart.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben <i>there were</i> great searchings of heart.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Zebulun and Naphtali <i>were</i> a people <i>that</i> jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The kings came <i>and</i> fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He asked water, <i>and</i> she gave <i>him</i> milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot <i>so</i> long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Have they not sped? have they <i>not</i> divided the prey; to every man a damsel <i>or</i> two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, <i>meet</i> for the necks of <i>them that take</i> the spoil?</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but <i>let</i> them that love him <i>be</i> as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.</p>
