# I Corinthians 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Have we not power to eat and to drink?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <i>as</i> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Or saith he <i>it</i> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <i>this</i> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <i>is it</i> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If others be partakers of <i>this</i> power over you, <i>are</i> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <i>of the things</i> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <i>it were</i> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <i>of the gospel</i> is committed unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; What is my reward then? <i>Verily</i> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For though I be free from all <i>men</i>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <i>men</i>, that I might by all means save some.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <i>do it</i> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But I keep under my body, and bring <i>it</i> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</p>
