# II Samuel 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <i>are</i> good and right; but <i>there is</i> no man <i>deputed</i> of the king to hear thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And it was <i>so</i>, that when any man came nigh <i>to him</i> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i>that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And David said unto all his servants that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <i>which were</i> concubines, to keep the house.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Whereas thou camest <i>but</i> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <i>be</i> with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Ittai answered the king, and said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, and <i>as</i> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <i>were</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <i>here am</i> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i>Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And David went up by the ascent of <i>mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <i>was</i> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And <i>one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And it came to pass, that <i>when</i> David was come to the top <i>of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto, so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And <i>hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <i>that</i> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <i>it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Behold, <i>they have</i> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's <i>son</i>, and Jonathan Abiathar's <i>son</i>; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>
