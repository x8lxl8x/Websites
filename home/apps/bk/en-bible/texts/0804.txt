# Ezekiel 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <i>even</i> unto this very day.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For <i>they are</i> impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns <i>be</i> with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they <i>are</i> most rebellious.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when I looked, behold, an hand <i>was</i> sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book <i>was</i> therein;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he spread it before me; and it <i>was</i> written within and without: and <i>there was</i> written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>
