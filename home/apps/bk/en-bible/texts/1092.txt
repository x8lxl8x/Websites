# Galatians 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God the Father, and <i>from</i> our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; To whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; As we said before, so say I now again, If any <i>man</i> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <i>it</i>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <i>me</i> by his grace,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And they glorified God in me.</p>
