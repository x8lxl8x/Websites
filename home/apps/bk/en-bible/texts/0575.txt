# Psalms 97

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad <i>thereof</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Clouds and darkness <i>are</i> round about him: righteousness and judgment <i>are</i> the habitation of his throne.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all <i>ye</i> gods.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For thou, LORD, <i>art</i> high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
