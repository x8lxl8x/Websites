# Psalms 87

<p class="intro">A Psalm <i>or</i> Song for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; His foundation <i>is</i> in the holy mountains.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this <i>man</i> was born there.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, <i>that</i> this <i>man</i> was born there. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; As well the singers as the players on instruments <i>shall be there</i>: all my springs <i>are</i> in thee.</p>
