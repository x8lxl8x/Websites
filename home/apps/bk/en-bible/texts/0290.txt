# II Samuel 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now these <i>be</i> the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man <i>who was</i> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <i>was</i> in my tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <i>must be</i> just, ruling in the fear of God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And <i>he shall be</i> as the light of the morning, <i>when</i> the sun riseth, <i>even</i> a morning without clouds; <i>as</i> the tender grass <i>springing</i> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Although my house <i>be</i> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <i>things</i>, and sure: for <i>this is</i> all my salvation, and all <i>my</i> desire, although he make <i>it</i> not to grow.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But <i>the sons</i> of Belial <i>shall be</i> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the man <i>that</i> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <i>same</i> place.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; These <i>be</i> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <i>was</i> Adino the Eznite: <i>he lift up his spear</i> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <i>one</i> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <i>that</i> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And after him <i>was</i> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And David <i>was</i> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <i>was</i> then <i>in</i> Bethlehem.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which <i>is</i> by the gate!</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: <i>is not this</i> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, <i>and</i> slew <i>them</i>, and had the name among three.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the <i>first</i> three.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the <i>first</i> three. And David set him over his guard.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Asahel the brother of Joab <i>was</i> one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</p>
