# Psalms 84

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; How amiable <i>are</i> thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, <i>even</i> thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Blessed <i>are</i> they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man whose strength <i>is</i> in thee; in whose heart <i>are</i> the ways <i>of them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Who</i> passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They go from strength to strength, <i>every one of them</i> in Zion appeareth before God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For a day in thy courts <i>is</i> better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the LORD God <i>is</i> a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good <i>thing</i> will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; O LORD of hosts, blessed <i>is</i> the man that trusteth in thee.</p>
