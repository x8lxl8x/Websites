# Psalms 52

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Maschil, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God <i>endureth</i> continually.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou lovest evil more than good; <i>and</i> lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou lovest all devouring words, O <i>thou</i> deceitful tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of <i>thy</i> dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Lo, <i>this is</i> the man <i>that</i> made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <i>and</i> strengthened himself in his wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done <i>it</i>: and I will wait on thy name; for <i>it is</i> good before thy saints.</p>
