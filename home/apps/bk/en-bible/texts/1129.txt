# II Timothy 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they shall turn away <i>their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my</i> course, I have kept the faith:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i>with thee</i>, and the books, <i>but</i> especially the parchments.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i>men</i> forsook me: <i>I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with thy spirit. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</p>
