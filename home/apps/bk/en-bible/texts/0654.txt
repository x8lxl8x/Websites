# Proverbs 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <i>and</i> drinketh damage.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The legs of the lame are not equal: so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <i>is</i> he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>As</i> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The great <i>God</i> that formed all <i>things</i> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; As a dog returneth to his vomit, <i>so</i> a fool returneth to his folly.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion in the way; a lion <i>is</i> in the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>As</i> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <i>doth</i> the slothful upon his bed.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The slothful hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The sluggard <i>is</i> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He that passeth by, <i>and</i> meddleth with strife <i>belonging</i> not to him, <i>is like</i> one that taketh a dog by the ears.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; As a mad <i>man</i> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; So <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Where no wood is, <i>there</i> the fire goeth out: so where <i>there is</i> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>As</i> coals <i>are</i> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <i>is</i> a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Burning lips and a wicked heart <i>are like</i> a potsherd covered with silver dross.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <i>there are</i> seven abominations in his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>Whose</i> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the <i>whole</i> congregation.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; A lying tongue hateth <i>those that are</i> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>
