# II Samuel 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The rich <i>man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Nathan said to David, Thou <i>art</i> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i>that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <i>them</i> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For thou didst <i>it</i> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also <i>that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <i>himself</i>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i>whether</i> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof <i>was</i> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <i>set</i> on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he brought forth the people that <i>were</i> therein, and put <i>them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p>
