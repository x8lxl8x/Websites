# Zechariah 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what <i>is</i> the breadth thereof, and what <i>is</i> the length thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited <i>as</i> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Ho, ho, <i>come forth</i>, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest <i>with</i> the daughter of Babylon.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</p>
