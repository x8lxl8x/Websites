# Isaiah 52

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Shake thyself from the dust; arise, <i>and</i> sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day <i>is</i> blasphemed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore <i>they shall know</i> in that day that I <i>am</i> he that doth speak: behold, <i>it is</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean <i>thing</i>; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel <i>will be</i> your rereward.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for <i>that</i> which had not been told them shall they see; and <i>that</i> which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>
