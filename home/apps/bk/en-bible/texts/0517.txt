# Psalms 39

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>even</i> to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, <i>even</i> from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: <i>then</i> spake I with my tongue,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it <i>is; that</i> I may know how frail I <i>am</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, thou hast made my days <i>as</i> an handbreadth; and mine age <i>is</i> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state <i>is</i> altogether vanity. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <i>riches</i>, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope <i>is</i> in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man <i>is</i> vanity. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I <i>am</i> a stranger with thee, <i>and</i> a sojourner, as all my fathers <i>were</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</p>
