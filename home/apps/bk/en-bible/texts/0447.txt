# Job 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou hast said, My doctrine <i>is</i> pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that <i>they are</i> double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee <i>less</i> than thine iniquity <i>deserveth</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>It is</i> as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The measure thereof <i>is</i> longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For vain man would be wise, though man be born <i>like</i> a wild ass's colt.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If iniquity <i>be</i> in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Because thou shalt forget <i>thy</i> misery, <i>and</i> remember <i>it</i> as waters <i>that</i> pass away:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And <i>thine</i> age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig <i>about thee, and</i> thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make <i>thee</i> afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope <i>shall be as</i> the giving up of the ghost.</p>
