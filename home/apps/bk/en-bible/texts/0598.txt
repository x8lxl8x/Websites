# Psalms 120

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, <i>and</i> from a deceitful tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, <i>that</i> I dwell in the tents of Kedar!</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I <i>am for</i> peace: but when I speak, they <i>are</i> for war.</p>
