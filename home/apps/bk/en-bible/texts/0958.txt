# Mark 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And there came a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Saying, Let <i>us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <i>is</i> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <i>men</i> seek for thee.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; But he went out, and began to publish <i>it</i> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
