# Psalms 111

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with <i>my</i> whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <i>in</i> the congregation.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The works of the LORD <i>are</i> great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; His work <i>is</i> honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD <i>is</i> gracious and full of compassion.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The works of his hands <i>are</i> verity and judgment; all his commandments <i>are</i> sure.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They stand fast for ever and ever, <i>and are</i> done in truth and uprightness.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend <i>is</i> his name.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do <i>his commandments</i>: his praise endureth for ever.</p>
