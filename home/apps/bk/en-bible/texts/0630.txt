# Proverbs 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea</i>, every good path.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man</i>, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men</i>, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
