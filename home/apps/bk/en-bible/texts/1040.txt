# Acts 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence <i>which I make</i> now unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I am verily a man <i>which am</i> a Jew, born in Tarsus, <i>a city</i> in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, <i>and</i> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <i>there</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they gave him audience unto this word, and <i>then</i> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <i>fellow</i> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And as they cried out, and cast off <i>their</i> clothes, and threw dust into the air,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; When the centurion heard <i>that</i>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <i>free</i> born.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <i>his</i> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</p>
