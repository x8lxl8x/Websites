# Psalms 70

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, to bring to remembrance.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; <i>Make haste</i>, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou <i>art</i> my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.</p>
