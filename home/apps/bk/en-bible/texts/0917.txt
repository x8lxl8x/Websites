# Zechariah 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of brass.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; In the first chariot <i>were</i> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the angel answered and said unto me, These <i>are</i> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The black horses which <i>are</i> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Take of <i>them of</i> the captivity, <i>even</i> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <i>them</i> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <i>is</i> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And they <i>that are</i> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <i>this</i> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</p>
