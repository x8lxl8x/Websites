# Psalms 77

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I cried unto God with my voice, <i>even</i> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <i>his</i> promise fail for evermore?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And I said, This <i>is</i> my infirmity: <i>but I will remember</i> the years of the right hand of the most High.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy way, O God, <i>is</i> in the sanctuary: who <i>is so</i> great a God as <i>our</i> God?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou hast with <i>thine</i> arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The voice of thy thunder <i>was</i> in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thy way <i>is</i> in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
