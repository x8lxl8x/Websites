# Psalms 81

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Gittith, <i>A Psalm</i> of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For this <i>was</i> a statute for Israel, <i>and</i> a law of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; This he ordained in Joseph <i>for</i> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <i>where</i> I heard a language <i>that</i> I understood not.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: <i>and</i> they walked in their own counsels.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <i>and</i> Israel had walked in my ways!</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p>
