# Psalms 100

<p class="intro">A Psalm of praise.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Know ye that the LORD he <i>is</i> God: <i>it is</i> he <i>that</i> hath made us, and not we ourselves; <i>we are</i> his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, <i>and</i> into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, <i>and</i> bless his name.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For the LORD <i>is</i> good; his mercy <i>is</i> everlasting; and his truth <i>endureth</i> to all generations.</p>
