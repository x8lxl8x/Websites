# Leviticus 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be <i>of</i> fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, <i>to be</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the remnant of the meat offering <i>shall be</i> Aaron's and his sons': <i>it is</i> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, <i>it shall be</i> unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And if thy oblation <i>be</i> a meat offering <i>baken</i> in a pan, it shall be <i>of</i> fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it <i>is</i> a meat offering.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And if thy oblation <i>be</i> a meat offering <i>baken</i> in the fryingpan, it shall be made <i>of</i> fine flour with oil.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn <i>it</i> upon the altar: <i>it is</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And that which is left of the meat offering <i>shall be</i> Aaron's and his sons': <i>it is</i> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, <i>even</i> corn beaten out of full ears.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it <i>is</i> a meat offering.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, <i>part</i> of the beaten corn thereof, and <i>part</i> of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: <i>it is</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
