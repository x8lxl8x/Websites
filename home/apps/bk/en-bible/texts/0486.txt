# Psalms 8

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD our Lord, how excellent <i>is</i> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <i>things</i> under his feet:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, <i>and whatsoever</i> passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O LORD our Lord, how excellent <i>is</i> thy name in all the earth!</p>
