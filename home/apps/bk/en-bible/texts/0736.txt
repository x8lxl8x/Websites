# Isaiah 57

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth <i>it</i> to heart: and merciful men <i>are</i> taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil <i>to come</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, <i>each one</i> walking <i>in</i> his uprightness.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, <i>and</i> draw out the tongue? <i>are</i> ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Among the smooth <i>stones</i> of the stream <i>is</i> thy portion; they, they <i>are</i> thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered <i>thyself to another</i> than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee <i>a covenant</i> with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase <i>thyself even</i> unto hell.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; <i>yet</i> saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid <i>it</i> to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take <i>them</i>: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name <i>is</i> Holy; I dwell in the high and holy <i>place</i>, with him also <i>that is</i> of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls <i>which</i> I have made.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to <i>him that is</i> far off, and to <i>him that is</i> near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But the wicked <i>are</i> like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p>
