# Psalms 105

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He <i>is</i> the LORD our God: his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Which <i>covenant</i> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When they were <i>but</i> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When they went from one nation to another, from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He sent a man before them, <i>even</i> Joseph, <i>who</i> was sold for a servant:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The king sent and loosed him; <i>even</i> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He sent Moses his servant; <i>and</i> Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <i>and</i> lice in all their coasts.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; He gave them hail for rain, <i>and</i> flaming fire in their land.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <i>there was</i> not one feeble <i>person</i> among their tribes.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; <i>The people</i> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <i>like</i> a river.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; For he remembered his holy promise, <i>and</i> Abraham his servant.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And he brought forth his people with joy, <i>and</i> his chosen with gladness:</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
