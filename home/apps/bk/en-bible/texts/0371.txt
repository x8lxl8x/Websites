# II Chronicles 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And under it <i>was</i> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen <i>were</i> cast, when it was cast.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea <i>was set</i> above upon them, and all their hinder parts <i>were</i> inward.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the thickness of it <i>was</i> an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; <i>and</i> it received and held three thousand baths.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea <i>was</i> for the priests to wash in.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He made also ten tables, and placed <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>To wit</i>, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters <i>which were</i> on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <i>were</i> on the top of the pillars;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <i>were</i> upon the pillars.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Solomon made all the vessels that <i>were for</i> the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread <i>was set</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, <i>made he of</i> gold, <i>and</i> that perfect gold;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, <i>of</i> pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy <i>place</i>, and the doors of the house of the temple, <i>were of</i> gold.</p>
