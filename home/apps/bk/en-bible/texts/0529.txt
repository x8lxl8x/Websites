# Psalms 51

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <i>is</i> ever before me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <i>this</i> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <i>and</i> be clear when thou judgest.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden <i>part</i> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Make me to hear joy and gladness; <i>that</i> the bones <i>which</i> thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me <i>with thy</i> free spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>Then</i> will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: <i>and</i> my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give <i>it</i>: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The sacrifices of God <i>are</i> a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</p>
