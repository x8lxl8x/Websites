# Ezekiel 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <i>even</i> of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set <i>it</i> on, and also pour water into it:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Gather the pieces thereof into it, <i>even</i> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <i>it</i> with the choice bones.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, <i>and</i> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum <i>is</i> therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and <i>that</i> the filthiness of it may be molten in it, <i>that</i> the scum of it may be consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; She hath wearied <i>herself</i> with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum <i>shall be</i> in the fire.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In thy filthiness <i>is</i> lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>: it shall come to pass, and I will do <i>it</i>; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not <i>thy</i> lips, and eat not the bread of men.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <i>things are</i> to us, that thou doest <i>so</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover <i>your</i> lips, nor eat the bread of men.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And your tires <i>shall be</i> upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Also, thou son of man, <i>shall it</i> not <i>be</i> in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>That</i> he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause <i>thee</i> to hear <i>it</i> with <i>thine</i> ears?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>
