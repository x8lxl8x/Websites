# Psalms 40

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, <i>and</i> established my goings.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he hath put a new song in my mouth, <i>even</i> praise unto our God: many shall see <i>it</i>, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Many, O LORD my God, <i>are</i> thy wonderful works <i>which</i> thou hast done, and thy thoughts <i>which are</i> to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: <i>if</i> I would declare and speak <i>of them</i>, they are more than can be numbered.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book <i>it is</i> written of me,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law <i>is</i> within my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> poor and needy; <i>yet</i> the Lord thinketh upon me: thou <i>art</i> my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</p>
