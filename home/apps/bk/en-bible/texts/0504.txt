# Psalms 26

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; <i>therefore</i> I shall not slide.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; In whose hands <i>is</i> mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.</p>
