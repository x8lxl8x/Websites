# Psalms 74

<p class="intro">Maschil of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O God, why hast thou cast <i>us</i> off for ever? <i>why</i> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Remember thy congregation, <i>which</i> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, <i>which</i> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <i>even</i> all <i>that</i> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns <i>for</i> signs.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>A man</i> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <i>by casting down</i> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; We see not our signs: <i>there is</i> no more any prophet: neither <i>is there</i> among us any that knoweth how long.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck <i>it</i> out of thy bosom.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For God <i>is</i> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, <i>and</i> gavest him <i>to be</i> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The day <i>is</i> thine, the night also <i>is</i> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Remember this, <i>that</i> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and <i>that</i> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude <i>of the wicked</i>: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>
