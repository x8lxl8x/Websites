# John 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that</i> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <i>it</i> unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew <i>it</i> unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then said <i>some</i> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give <i>it</i> you.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
