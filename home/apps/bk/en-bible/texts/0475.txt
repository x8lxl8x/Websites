# Job 39

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? <i>or</i> canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Canst thou number the months <i>that</i> they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The range of the mountains <i>is</i> his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wilt thou trust him, because his strength <i>is</i> great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather <i>it into</i> thy barn?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>Gavest thou</i> the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; She is hardened against her young ones, as though <i>they were</i> not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils <i>is</i> terrible.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in <i>his</i> strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that <i>it is</i> the sound of the trumpet.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, <i>and</i> stretch her wings toward the south?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; From thence she seeketh the prey, <i>and</i> her eyes behold afar off.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain <i>are</i>, there <i>is</i> she.</p>
