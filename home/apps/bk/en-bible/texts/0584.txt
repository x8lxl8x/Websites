# Psalms 106

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <i>who</i> can shew forth all his praise?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Blessed <i>are</i> they that keep judgment, <i>and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <i>that thou bearest unto</i> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <i>him</i> at the sea, <i>even</i> at the Red sea.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <i>them</i>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They envied Moses also in the camp, <i>and</i> Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <i>and</i> terrible things by the Red sea.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But murmured in their tents, <i>and</i> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Thus they provoked <i>him</i> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <i>so</i> the plague was stayed.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; They angered <i>him</i> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And shed innocent blood, <i>even</i> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <i>him</i> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <i>and</i> to triumph in thy praise.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
