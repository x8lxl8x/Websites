# Romans 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <i>but</i> not to doubtful disputations.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <i>alike</i>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He that regardeth the day, regardeth <i>it</i> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <i>it</i>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For it is written, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <i>his</i> brother's way.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <i>there is</i> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him <i>it is</i> unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But if thy brother be grieved with <i>thy</i> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For he that in these things serveth Christ <i>is</i> acceptable to God, and approved of men.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed <i>are</i> pure; but <i>it is</i> evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>It is</i> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <i>any thing</i> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Hast thou faith? have <i>it</i> to thyself before God. Happy <i>is</i> he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because <i>he eateth</i> not of faith: for whatsoever <i>is</i> not of faith is sin.</p>
