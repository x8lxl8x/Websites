<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <i>certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Children in whom <i>was</i> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <i>had</i> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <i>the name</i> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <i>are</i> of your sort? then shall ye make <i>me</i> endanger my head to the king.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers that <i>were</i> in all his realm.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Daniel continued <i>even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>
