# Job 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Job spake, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <i>in which</i> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; As <i>for</i> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <i>have</i> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Because it shut not up the doors of my <i>mother's</i> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Why died I not from the womb? <i>why</i> did I <i>not</i> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <i>which</i> never saw light.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; There the wicked cease <i>from</i> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>There</i> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The small and great are there; and the servant <i>is</i> free from his master.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <i>in</i> soul;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Which long for death, but it <i>cometh</i> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Which rejoice exceedingly, <i>and</i> are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>Why is light given</i> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>
