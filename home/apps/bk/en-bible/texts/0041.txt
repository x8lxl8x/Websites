# Genesis 41

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <i>other</i> kine upon the brink of the river.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <i>there was</i> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, <i>both</i> me and the chief baker:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And <i>there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <i>himself</i>, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <i>that</i> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <i>It is</i> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <i>were</i> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <i>this</i> unto the magicians; but <i>there was</i> none that could declare <i>it</i> to me.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <i>is</i> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i>is</i> about to do.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The seven good kine <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven good ears <i>are</i> seven years: the dream <i>is</i> one.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <i>is</i> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <i>shall be</i> very grievous.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <i>it is</i> because the thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Let Pharaoh do <i>this</i>, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this <i>is</i>, a man in whom the Spirit of God <i>is</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <i>there is</i> none so discreet and wise as thou <i>art</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <i>ruler</i> over all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And Joseph <i>was</i> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <i>was</i> round about every city, laid he up in the same.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <i>it was</i> without number.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <i>said he</i>, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <i>corn</i>; because that the famine was <i>so</i> sore in all lands.</p>
