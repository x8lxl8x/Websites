# II Peter 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For if these things be in you, and abound, they make <i>you that ye shall</i> neither <i>be</i> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <i>them</i>, and be established in the present truth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <i>you</i> in remembrance;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Knowing that shortly I must put off <i>this</i> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
