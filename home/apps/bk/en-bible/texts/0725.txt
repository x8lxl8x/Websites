# Isaiah 46

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages <i>were</i> heavy loaden; <i>they are</i> a burden to the weary <i>beast</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne <i>by me</i> from the belly, which are carried from the womb:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And <i>even</i> to <i>your</i> old age I <i>am</i> he; and <i>even</i> to hoar hairs will I carry <i>you</i>: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; To whom will ye liken me, and make <i>me</i> equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, <i>and</i> hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, <i>one</i> shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring <i>it</i> again to mind, O ye transgressors.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Remember the former things of old: for I <i>am</i> God, and <i>there is</i> none else; <i>I am</i> God, and <i>there is</i> none like me,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times <i>the things</i> that are not <i>yet</i> done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken <i>it</i>, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed <i>it</i>, I will also do it.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that <i>are</i> far from righteousness:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</p>
