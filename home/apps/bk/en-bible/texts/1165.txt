# II Johnn

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Grace be with you, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <i>your</i> house, neither bid him God speed:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Having many things to write unto you, I would not <i>write</i> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
