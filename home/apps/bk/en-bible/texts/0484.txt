# Psalms 6

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I <i>am</i> weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For in death <i>there is</i> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return <i>and</i> be ashamed suddenly.</p>
