# Psalms 54

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, God <i>is</i> mine helper: the Lord <i>is</i> with them that uphold my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <i>it is</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen <i>his desire</i> upon mine enemies.</p>
