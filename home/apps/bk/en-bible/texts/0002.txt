# Genesis 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i>there was</i> not a man to till the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the LORD God formed man <i>of</i> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison: that <i>is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there is</i> gold;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the gold of that land <i>is</i> good: there <i>is</i> bdellium and the onyx stone.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the name of the second river <i>is</i> Gihon: the same <i>is</i> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the name of the third river <i>is</i> Hiddekel: that <i>is</i> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river <i>is</i> Euphrates.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the LORD God said, <i>It is</i> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <i>them</i> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <i>was</i> the name thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Adam said, This <i>is</i> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>
