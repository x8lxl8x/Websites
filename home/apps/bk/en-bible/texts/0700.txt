# Isaiah 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; <i>so</i> it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing <i>of it</i>; I was dismayed at the seeing <i>of it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, <i>and</i> anoint the shield.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he saw a chariot <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, <i>and</i> a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>
