# Luke 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <i>him</i> stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And John calling <i>unto him</i> two of his disciples sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And in that same hour he cured many of <i>their</i> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <i>that were</i> blind he gave sight.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And blessed is <i>he</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; This is <i>he</i>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And all the people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And stood at his feet behind <i>him</i> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i>it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Simon answered and said, I suppose that <i>he</i>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
