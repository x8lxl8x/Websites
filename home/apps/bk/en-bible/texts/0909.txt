# Zephaniah 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Her princes within her <i>are</i> roaring lions; her judges <i>are</i> evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Her prophets <i>are</i> light <i>and</i> treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The just LORD <i>is</i> in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, <i>and</i> corrupted all their doings.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination <i>is</i> to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, <i>even</i> all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, <i>even</i> the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, <i>even</i> the LORD, <i>is</i> in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: <i>and to</i> Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The LORD thy God in the midst of thee <i>is</i> mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I will gather <i>them that are</i> sorrowful for the solemn assembly, <i>who</i> are of thee, <i>to whom</i> the reproach of it <i>was</i> a burden.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; At that time will I bring you <i>again</i>, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</p>
