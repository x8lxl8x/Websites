# Psalms 27

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD <i>is</i> the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When the wicked, <i>even</i> mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> confident.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; One <i>thing</i> have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Hear, O LORD, <i>when</i> I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>When thou saidst</i>, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Hide not thy face <i>far</i> from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>I had fainted</i>, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</p>
