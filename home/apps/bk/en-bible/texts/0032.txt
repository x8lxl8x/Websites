# Genesis 32

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And when Jacob saw them, he said, This <i>is</i> God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <i>was</i> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, <i>and</i> the mother with the children.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he delivered <i>them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose <i>art</i> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose <i>are</i> these before thee?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then thou shalt say, <i>They be</i> thy servant Jacob's; it <i>is</i> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <i>is</i> behind us.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And he said unto him, What <i>is</i> thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Jacob asked <i>him</i>, and said, Tell <i>me</i>, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Therefore the children of Israel eat not <i>of</i> the sinew which shrank, which <i>is</i> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
