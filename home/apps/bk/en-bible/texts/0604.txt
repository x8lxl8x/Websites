# Psalms 126

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The LORD hath done great things for us; <i>whereof</i> we are glad.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <i>with him</i>.</p>
