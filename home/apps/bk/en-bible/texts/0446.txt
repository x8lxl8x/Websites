# Job 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Is it</i> good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Are</i> thy days as the days of man? <i>are</i> thy years as man's days,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and <i>there is</i> none that can deliver out of thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And these <i>things</i> hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this <i>is</i> with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; If I be wicked, woe unto me; and <i>if</i> I be righteous, <i>yet</i> will I not lift up my head. <i>I am</i> full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war <i>are</i> against me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>Are</i> not my days few? cease <i>then, and</i> let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Before I go <i>whence</i> I shall not return, <i>even</i> to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; A land of darkness, as darkness <i>itself; and</i> of the shadow of death, without any order, and <i>where</i> the light <i>is</i> as darkness.</p>
