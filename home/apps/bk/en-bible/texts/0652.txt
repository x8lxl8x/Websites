# Proverbs 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A wise man <i>is</i> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The thought of foolishness <i>is</i> sin: and the scorner <i>is</i> an abomination to men.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <i>is</i> small.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If thou forbear to deliver <i>them that are</i> drawn unto death, and <i>those that are</i> ready to be slain;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <i>it</i>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <i>not</i> he know <i>it</i>? and shall <i>not</i> he render to <i>every</i> man according to his works?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; My son, eat thou honey, because <i>it is</i> good; and the honeycomb, <i>which is</i> sweet to thy taste:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; So <i>shall</i> the knowledge of wisdom <i>be</i> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <i>it</i>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Lay not wait, O wicked <i>man</i>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For a just <i>man</i> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For there shall be no reward to the evil <i>man</i>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But to them that rebuke <i>him</i> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>Every man</i> shall kiss <i>his</i> lips that giveth a right answer.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <i>not</i> with thy lips.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <i>and</i> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Then I saw, <i>and</i> considered <i>it</i> well: I looked upon <i>it, and</i> received instruction.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; So shall thy poverty come <i>as</i> one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</p>
