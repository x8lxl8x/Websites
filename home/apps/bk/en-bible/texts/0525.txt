# Psalms 47

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the LORD most high <i>is</i> terrible; <i>he is</i> a great King over all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For God <i>is</i> the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The princes of the people are gathered together, <i>even</i> the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth <i>belong</i> unto God: he is greatly exalted.</p>
