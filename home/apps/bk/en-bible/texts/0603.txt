# Psalms 125

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; They that trust in the LORD <i>shall be</i> as mount Zion, <i>which</i> cannot be removed, <i>but</i> abideth for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As the mountains <i>are</i> round about Jerusalem, so the LORD <i>is</i> round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Do good, O LORD, unto <i>those that be</i> good, and <i>to them that are</i> upright in their hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: <i>but</i> peace <i>shall be</i> upon Israel.</p>
