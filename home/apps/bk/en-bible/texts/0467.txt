# Job 31

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For what portion of God <i>is there</i> from above? and <i>what</i> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not destruction to the wicked? and a strange <i>punishment</i> to the workers of iniquity?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>Then</i> let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or <i>if</i> I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Then</i> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> an heinous crime; yea, it <i>is</i> an iniquity <i>to be punished by</i> the judges.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For it <i>is</i> a fire <i>that</i> consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; If I have withheld the poor from <i>their</i> desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as <i>with</i> a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; If his loins have not blessed me, and <i>if</i> he were <i>not</i> warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>Then</i> let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For destruction <i>from</i> God <i>was</i> a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, <i>Thou art</i> my confidence;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; If I rejoiced because my wealth <i>was</i> great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking <i>in</i> brightness;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; This also <i>were</i> an iniquity <i>to be punished by</i> the judge: for I should have denied the God <i>that is</i> above.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The stranger did not lodge in the street: <i>but</i> I opened my doors to the traveller.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, <i>and</i> went not out of the door?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire <i>is, that</i> the Almighty would answer me, and <i>that</i> mine adversary had written a book.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, <i>and</i> bind it <i>as</i> a crown to me.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
