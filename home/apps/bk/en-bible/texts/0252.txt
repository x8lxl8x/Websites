# I Samuel 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <i>it</i>, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <i>him</i> whom I name unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed <i>is</i> before him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i>the LORD seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <i>thy</i> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <i>was</i> ruddy, <i>and</i> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <i>is</i> he.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let our lord now command thy servants, <i>which are</i> before thee, to seek out a man, <i>who is</i> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <i>him</i> to me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <i>that is</i> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD <i>is</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <i>is</i> with the sheep.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Jesse took an ass <i>laden</i> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <i>them</i> by David his son unto Saul.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And it came to pass, when the <i>evil</i> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p>
