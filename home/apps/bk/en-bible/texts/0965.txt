# Mark 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and saith unto them,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these <i>men</i> with bread here in the wilderness?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <i>them</i>; and they did set <i>them</i> before the people.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now <i>the disciples</i> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <i>of</i> the leaven of Herod.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have no bread.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when Jesus knew <i>it</i>, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; After that he put <i>his</i> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell <i>it</i> to any in the town.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <i>say</i>, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <i>of</i> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And when he had called the people <i>unto him</i> with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p>
