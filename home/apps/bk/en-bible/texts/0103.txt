# Leviticus 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <i>like</i> the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <i>when</i> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <i>be</i> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If the bright spot <i>be</i> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <i>be</i> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the plague seven days:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <i>and</i> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague <i>be</i> somewhat dark, <i>and</i> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <i>is but</i> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And <i>if</i> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> a leprosy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the priest shall see <i>him</i>: and, behold, <i>if</i> the rising <i>be</i> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <i>there be</i> quick raw flesh in the rising;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; It <i>is</i> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <i>is</i> unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <i>him that hath</i> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <i>if</i> the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <i>him</i> clean <i>that hath</i> the plague: it is all turned white: he <i>is</i> clean.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <i>for</i> the raw flesh <i>is</i> unclean: it <i>is</i> a leprosy.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <i>him</i> clean <i>that hath</i> the plague: he <i>is</i> clean.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The flesh also, in which, <i>even</i> in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <i>be</i> in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <i>there be</i> no white hairs therein, and <i>if</i> it <i>be</i> not lower than the skin, but <i>be</i> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> a plague.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But if the bright spot stay in his place, <i>and</i> spread not, it <i>is</i> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Or if there be <i>any</i> flesh, in the skin whereof <i>there is</i> a hot burning, and the quick <i>flesh</i> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <i>if</i> the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it <i>be in</i> sight deeper than the skin; it <i>is</i> a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> the plague of leprosy.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <i>there be</i> no white hair in the bright spot, and it <i>be</i> no lower than the <i>other</i> skin, but <i>be</i> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <i>and</i> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> the plague of leprosy.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And if the bright spot stay in his place, <i>and</i> spread not in the skin, but it <i>be</i> somewhat dark; it <i>is</i> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <i>is</i> an inflammation of the burning.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it <i>be</i> in sight deeper than the skin; <i>and there be</i> in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i>is</i> a dry scall, <i>even</i> a leprosy upon the head or beard.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it <i>be</i> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <i>that there is</i> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the plague of the scall seven days:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <i>if</i> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <i>be</i> not in sight deeper than the skin;</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the scall seven days more:</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, <i>if</i> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <i>be</i> in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <i>is</i> unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <i>that</i> there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <i>is</i> clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <i>even</i> white bright spots;</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <i>if</i> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <i>be</i> darkish white; it <i>is</i> a freckled spot <i>that</i> groweth in the skin; he <i>is</i> clean.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <i>is</i> bald; <i>yet is</i> he clean.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he <i>is</i> forehead bald: <i>yet is</i> he clean.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it <i>is</i> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <i>if</i> the rising of the sore <i>be</i> white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; He is a leprous man, he <i>is</i> unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <i>is</i> in his head.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And the leper in whom the plague <i>is</i>, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; All the days wherein the plague <i>shall be</i> in him he shall be defiled; he <i>is</i> unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp <i>shall</i> his habitation <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, <i>whether it be</i> a woollen garment, or a linen garment;</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Whether <i>it be</i> in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up <i>it that hath</i> the plague seven days:</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, <i>or</i> in any work that is made of skin; the plague <i>is</i> a fretting leprosy; it <i>is</i> unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it <i>is</i> a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; Then the priest shall command that they wash <i>the thing</i> wherein the plague <i>is</i>, and he shall shut it up seven days more:</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it <i>is</i> unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it <i>is</i> fret inward, <i>whether</i> it <i>be</i> bare within or without.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague <i>be</i> somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <i>is</i> a spreading <i>plague</i>: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague <i>is</i> with fire.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin <i>it be</i>, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</p>
