# Job 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How long wilt thou speak these <i>things</i>? and <i>how long shall</i> the words of thy mouth <i>be like</i> a strong wind?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If thou <i>wert</i> pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; (For we <i>are but of</i> yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth <i>are</i> a shadow:)</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Shall not they teach thee, <i>and</i> tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Whilst it <i>is</i> yet in his greenness, <i>and</i> not cut down, it withereth before any <i>other</i> herb.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; So <i>are</i> the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust <i>shall be</i> a spider's web.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He <i>is</i> green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; His roots are wrapped about the heap, <i>and</i> seeth the place of stones.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; If he destroy him from his place, then <i>it</i> shall deny him, <i>saying</i>, I have not seen thee.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Behold, this <i>is</i> the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Behold, God will not cast away a perfect <i>man</i>, neither will he help the evil doers:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</p>
