# Philippians 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <i>in</i> all judgment;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <i>which happened</i> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <i>places</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; According to my earnest expectation and <i>my</i> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <i>that</i> with all boldness, as always, <i>so</i> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <i>it be</i> by life, or by death.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For to me to live <i>is</i> Christ, and to die <i>is</i> gain.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But if I live in the flesh, this <i>is</i> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <i>is</i> more needful for you.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <i>to be</i> in me.</p>
