# Psalms 101

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; <i>it</i> shall not cleave to me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked <i>person</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Mine eyes <i>shall be</i> upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.</p>
