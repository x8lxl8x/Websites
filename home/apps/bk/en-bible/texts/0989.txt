# Luke 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So he called every one of his lord's debtors <i>unto him</i>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The law and the prophets <i>were</i> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from <i>her</i> husband committeth adultery.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <i>would come</i> from thence.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
