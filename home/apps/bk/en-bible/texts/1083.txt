# II Corinthians 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; For we know that if our earthly house of <i>this</i> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For we that are in <i>this</i> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <i>is</i> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore <i>we are</i> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; We are confident, <i>I say</i>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i>done</i> in <i>his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <i>answer</i> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For whether we be beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> to God: or whether we be sober, <i>it is</i> for your cause.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And <i>that</i> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <i>him</i> no more.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Therefore if any man <i>be</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And all things <i>are</i> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <i>you</i> by us: we pray <i>you</i> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For he hath made him <i>to be</i> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
