# Titus 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</p>
