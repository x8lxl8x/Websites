# Job 19

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed <i>that</i> ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And be it indeed <i>that</i> I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If indeed ye will magnify <i>yourselves</i> against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but <i>there is</i> no judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <i>from</i> my head.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as <i>one of</i> his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I called my servant, and he gave <i>me</i> no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's <i>sake</i> of mine own body.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For I know <i>that</i> my redeemer liveth, and <i>that</i> he shall stand at the latter <i>day</i> upon the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And <i>though</i> after my skin <i>worms</i> destroy this <i>body</i>, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; <i>though</i> my reins be consumed within me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <i>bringeth</i> the punishments of the sword, that ye may know <i>there is</i> a judgment.</p>
