# Isaiah 54

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Sing, O barren, thou <i>that</i> didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou <i>that</i> didst not travail with child: for more <i>are</i> the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thy Maker <i>is</i> thine husband; the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For this <i>is as</i> the waters of Noah unto me: for <i>as</i> I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, <i>and</i> not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And all thy children <i>shall be</i> taught of the LORD; and great <i>shall be</i> the peace of thy children.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, they shall surely gather together, <i>but</i> not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue <i>that</i> shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This <i>is</i> the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness <i>is</i> of me, saith the LORD.</p>
