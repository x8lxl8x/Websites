# Judges 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, <i>even</i> as many <i>of Israel</i> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Namely</i>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But he himself turned again from the quarries that <i>were</i> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <i>them</i>: and, behold, their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</p>
