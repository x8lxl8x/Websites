# Titus 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The aged women likewise, that <i>they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well in all <i>things</i>; not answering again;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
