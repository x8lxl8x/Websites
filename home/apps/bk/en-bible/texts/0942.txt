# Matthew 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when he sowed, some <i>seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For this people's heart is waxed gross, and <i>their</i> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and should understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But blessed <i>are</i> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <i>men</i> have desired to see <i>those things</i> which ye see, and have not seen <i>them</i>; and to hear <i>those things</i> which ye hear, and have not heard <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it</i> not, then cometh the wicked <i>one</i>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i>it</i>; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i>one</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe <i>which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <i>man</i> this wisdom, and <i>these</i> mighty works?</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <i>man</i> all these things?</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>
