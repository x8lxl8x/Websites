# Ezekiel 35

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I <i>am</i> against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed <i>the blood of</i> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time <i>that their</i> iniquity <i>had</i> an end:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I will fill his mountains with his slain <i>men</i>: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, <i>and that</i> I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, <i>even</i> all of it: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>
