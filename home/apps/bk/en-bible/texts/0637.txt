# Proverbs 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine <i>which</i> I have mingled.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise <i>man</i>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <i>man</i>, and he will increase in learning.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous: <i>she is</i> simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <i>eaten</i> in secret is pleasant.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But he knoweth not that the dead <i>are</i> there; <i>and that</i> her guests <i>are</i> in the depths of hell.</p>
