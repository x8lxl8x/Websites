# Psalms 56

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Mine enemies would daily swallow <i>me</i> up: for <i>they be</i> many that fight against me, O thou most High.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts <i>are</i> against me for evil.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Shall they escape by iniquity? in <i>thine</i> anger cast down the people, O God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: <i>are they</i> not in thy book?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When I cry <i>unto thee</i>, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God <i>is</i> for me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; In God will I praise <i>his</i> word: in the LORD will I praise <i>his</i> word.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thy vows <i>are</i> upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For thou hast delivered my soul from death: <i>wilt</i> not <i>thou deliver</i> my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</p>
