# Lamentations 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the man <i>that</i> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He hath led me, and brought <i>me into</i> darkness, but not <i>into</i> light.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand <i>against me</i> all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He hath builded against me, and compassed <i>me</i> with gall and travail.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He hath set me in dark places, as <i>they that be</i> dead of old.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He <i>was</i> unto me <i>as</i> a bear lying in wait, <i>and as</i> a lion in secret places.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I was a derision to all my people; <i>and</i> their song all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My soul hath <i>them</i> still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>It is of</i> the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>They are</i> new every morning: great <i>is</i> thy faithfulness.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> good unto them that wait for him, to the soul <i>that</i> seeketh him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>It is</i> good that <i>a man</i> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; <i>It is</i> good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne <i>it</i> upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; He giveth <i>his</i> cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> saith, and it cometh to pass, <i>when</i> the Lord commandeth <i>it</i> not?</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Let us lift up our heart with <i>our</i> hands unto God in the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that <i>our</i> prayer should not pass through.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Thou hast made us <i>as</i> the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; Waters flowed over mine head; <i>then</i> I said, I am cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; Thou drewest near in the day <i>that</i> I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</p>

<p>%[l|60]&ensp; Thou hast seen all their vengeance <i>and</i> all their imaginations against me.</p>

<p>%[l|61]&ensp; Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, <i>and</i> all their imaginations against me;</p>

<p>%[l|62]&ensp; The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|63]&ensp; Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I <i>am</i> their musick.</p>

<p>%[l|64]&ensp; Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</p>

<p>%[l|65]&ensp; Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|66]&ensp; Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</p>
