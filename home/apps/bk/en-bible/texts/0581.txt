# Psalms 103

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, <i>bless</i> his holy name.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <i>things; so that</i> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i>his anger</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For as the heaven is high above the earth, <i>so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; As far as the east is from the west, <i>so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Like as a father pitieth <i>his</i> children, <i>so</i> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <i>are</i> dust.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>As for</i> man, his days <i>are</i> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But the mercy of the LORD <i>is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Bless ye the LORD, all <i>ye</i> his hosts; <i>ye</i> ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>
