# Psalms 145

<p class="intro">David's <i>Psalm</i> of praise.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness <i>is</i> unsearchable.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And <i>men</i> shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> good to all: and his tender mercies <i>are</i> over all his works.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy kingdom <i>is</i> an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion <i>endureth</i> throughout all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all <i>those that be</i> bowed down.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
