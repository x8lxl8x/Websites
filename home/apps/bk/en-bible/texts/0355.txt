# I Chronicles 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O LORD God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; O LORD, <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.</p>
