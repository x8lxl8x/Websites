# Romans 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <i>the image of</i> Baal.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And if by grace, then <i>is it</i> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <i>it be</i> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <i>rather</i> through their fall salvation <i>is come</i> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now if the fall of them <i>be</i> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If by any means I may provoke to emulation <i>them which are</i> my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For if the casting away of them <i>be</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>shall</i> the receiving <i>of them be</i>, but life from the dead?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For if the firstfruit <i>be</i> holy, the lump <i>is</i> also <i>holy</i>: and if the root <i>be</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For if God spared not the natural branches, <i>take heed</i> lest he also spare not thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <i>his</i> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <i>branches</i>, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; As concerning the gospel, <i>they are</i> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <i>they are</i> beloved for the fathers' sakes.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For the gifts and calling of God <i>are</i> without repentance.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <i>are</i> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; For of him, and through him, and to him, <i>are</i> all things: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever. Amen.</p>
