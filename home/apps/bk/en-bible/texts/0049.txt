# Genesis 49

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you <i>that</i> which shall befall you in the last days.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Reuben, thou <i>art</i> my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou <i>it</i>: he went up to my couch.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Simeon and Levi <i>are</i> brethren; instruments of cruelty <i>are in</i> their habitations.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Cursed <i>be</i> their anger, for <i>it was</i> fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Judah, thou <i>art he</i> whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand <i>shall be</i> in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Judah <i>is</i> a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him <i>shall</i> the gathering of the people <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; His eyes <i>shall be</i> red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he <i>shall be</i> for an haven of ships; and his border <i>shall be</i> unto Zidon.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Issachar <i>is</i> a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he saw that rest <i>was</i> good, and the land that <i>it was</i> pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Out of Asher his bread <i>shall be</i> fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Naphtali <i>is</i> a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Joseph <i>is</i> a fruitful bough, <i>even</i> a fruitful bough by a well; <i>whose</i> branches run over the wall:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot <i>at him</i>, and hated him:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob; (from thence <i>is</i> the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; <i>Even</i> by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Benjamin shall ravin <i>as</i> a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; All these <i>are</i> the twelve tribes of Israel: and this <i>is it</i> that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that <i>is</i> in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; In the cave that <i>is</i> in the field of Machpelah, which <i>is</i> before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The purchase of the field and of the cave that <i>is</i> therein <i>was</i> from the children of Heth.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
