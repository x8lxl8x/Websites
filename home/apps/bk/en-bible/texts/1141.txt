# Hebrews 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now of the things which we have spoken <i>this is</i> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore <i>it is</i> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <i>that</i> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In that he saith, A new <i>covenant</i>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old <i>is</i> ready to vanish away.</p>
