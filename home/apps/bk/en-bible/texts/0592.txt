# Psalms 114

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Judah was his sanctuary, <i>and</i> Israel his dominion.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The sea saw <i>it</i>, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The mountains skipped like rams, <i>and</i> the little hills like lambs.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; What <i>ailed</i> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, <i>that</i> thou wast driven back?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Ye mountains, <i>that</i> ye skipped like rams; <i>and</i> ye little hills, like lambs?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Which turned the rock <i>into</i> a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
