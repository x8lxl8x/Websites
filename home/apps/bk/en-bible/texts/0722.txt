# Isaiah 43

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called <i>thee</i> by thy name; thou <i>art</i> mine.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When thou passest through the waters, I <i>will be</i> with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt <i>for</i> thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Fear not: for I <i>am</i> with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Even</i> every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, <i>It is</i> truth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Ye <i>are</i> my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I <i>am</i> he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I, <i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> the LORD; and beside me <i>there is</i> no saviour.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when <i>there was</i> no strange <i>god</i> among you: therefore ye <i>are</i> my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I <i>am</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Yea, before the day <i>was</i> I <i>am</i> he; and <i>there is</i> none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry <i>is</i> in the ships.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, <i>and</i> rivers in the desert.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, <i>and</i> rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I, <i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</p>
