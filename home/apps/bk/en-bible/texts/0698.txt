# Isaiah 19

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, <i>and</i> kingdom against kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And they shall turn the rivers far away; <i>and</i> the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no <i>more</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices <i>and</i> ponds for fish.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Surely the princes of Zoan <i>are</i> fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I <i>am</i> the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Where <i>are</i> they? where <i>are</i> thy wise <i>men</i>? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, <i>even they that are</i> the stay of the tribes thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken <i>man</i> staggereth in his vomit.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Neither shall there be <i>any</i> work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal <i>it</i>: and they shall return <i>even</i> to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, <i>even</i> a blessing in the midst of the land:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed <i>be</i> Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</p>
