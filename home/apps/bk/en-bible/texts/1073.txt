# I Corinthians 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i>am</i> of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <i>them</i> to you.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <i>is</i> the man; and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonoureth his head.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For this cause ought the woman to have power on <i>her</i> head because of the angels.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <i>her</i> hair is given her for a covering.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now in this that I declare <i>unto you</i> I praise <i>you</i> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; When ye come together therefore into one place, <i>this</i> is not to eat the Lord's supper.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For in eating every one taketh before <i>other</i> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <i>you</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <i>same</i> night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when he had given thanks, he brake <i>it</i>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; After the same manner also <i>he took</i> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <i>this</i> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <i>that</i> bread, and drink of <i>that</i> cup.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; For this cause many <i>are</i> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>
