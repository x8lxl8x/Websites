# Psalms 93

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, <i>wherewith</i> he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thy throne <i>is</i> established of old: thou <i>art</i> from everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD on high <i>is</i> mightier than the noise of many waters, <i>yea, than</i> the mighty waves of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.</p>
