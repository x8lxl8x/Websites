# Psalms 130

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But <i>there is</i> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My soul <i>waiteth</i> for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: <i>I say, more than</i> they that watch for the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD <i>there is</i> mercy, and with him <i>is</i> plenteous redemption.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
