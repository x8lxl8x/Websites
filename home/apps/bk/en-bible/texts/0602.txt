# Psalms 124

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; If <i>it had not been</i> the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; If <i>it had not been</i> the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, who hath not given us <i>as</i> a prey to their teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Our help <i>is</i> in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.</p>
