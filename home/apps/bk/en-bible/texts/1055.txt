# Romans 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who are Israelites; to whom <i>pertaineth</i> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <i>of God</i>, and the promises;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Whose <i>are</i> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <i>came</i>, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <i>are</i> not all Israel, which are of Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <i>are they</i> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And not only <i>this</i>; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <i>even</i> by our father Isaac;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; (For <i>the children</i> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; What shall we say then? <i>Is there</i> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; So then <i>it is</i> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <i>have mercy</i>, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <i>it</i>, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>What</i> if God, willing to shew <i>his</i> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For he will finish the work, and cut <i>it</i> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Wherefore? Because <i>they sought it</i> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
