<p>%[l|1]&ensp; He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his</i> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth <i>his</i> substance.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In the transgression of an evil man <i>there is</i> a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: <i>but</i> the wicked regardeth not to know <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>If</i> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, <i>there is</i> no rest.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <i>man</i> keepeth it in till afterwards.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants <i>are</i> wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left <i>to himself</i> bringeth his mother to shame.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Seest thou a man <i>that is</i> hasty in his words? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become <i>his</i> son at the length.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth <i>it</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Many seek the ruler's favour; but <i>every</i> man's judgment <i>cometh</i> from the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; An unjust man <i>is</i> an abomination to the just: and <i>he that is</i> upright in the way <i>is</i> abomination to the wicked.</p>
