# Proverbs 31

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>It is</i> not for kings, O Lemuel, <i>it is</i> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; She perceiveth that her merchandise <i>is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <i>is</i> silk and purple.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; She maketh fine linen, and selleth <i>it</i>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i>also</i>, and he praiseth her.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Favour <i>is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i>is</i> vain: <i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
