# Amos 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear ye this word which I take up against you, <i>even</i> a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; <i>there is</i> none to raise her up.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out <i>by</i> a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth <i>by</i> an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour <i>it</i>, and <i>there be</i> none to quench <i>it</i> in Bethel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>Seek him</i> that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD <i>is</i> his name:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Forasmuch therefore as your treading <i>is</i> upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate <i>from their right</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it <i>is</i> an evil time.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing <i>shall be</i> in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And in all vineyards <i>shall be</i> wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end <i>is</i> it for you? the day of the LORD <i>is</i> darkness, and not light.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>Shall</i> not the day of the LORD <i>be</i> darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept <i>them</i>: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name <i>is</i> The God of hosts.</p>
