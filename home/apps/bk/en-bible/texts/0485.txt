# Psalms 7

<p class="intro">Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <i>it</i> in pieces, while <i>there is</i> none to deliver.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <i>it</i>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <i>to</i> the judgment <i>that</i> thou hast commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <i>that is</i> in me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; My defence <i>is</i> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <i>with the wicked</i> every day.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <i>which</i> he made.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>
