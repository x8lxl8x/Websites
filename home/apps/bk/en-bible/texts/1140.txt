# Hebrews 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now consider how great this man <i>was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i>receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For he testifieth, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i>did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And inasmuch as not without an oath <i>he was made priest</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But this <i>man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For such an high priest became us, <i>who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i>maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>
