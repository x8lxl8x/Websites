# Genesis 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name <i>was</i> Keturah.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these <i>were</i> the children of Keturah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full <i>of years</i>; and was gathered to his people.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which <i>is</i> before Mamre;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Ishmael, and these <i>are</i> their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that <i>is</i> before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: <i>and</i> he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she <i>was</i> barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If <i>it be</i> so, why <i>am</i> I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the LORD said unto her, Two nations <i>are</i> in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and <i>the one</i> people shall be stronger than <i>the other</i> people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, <i>there were</i> twins in her womb.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac <i>was</i> threescore years old when she bare them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob <i>was</i> a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of <i>his</i> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he <i>was</i> faint:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <i>pottage</i>; for I <i>am</i> faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And Esau said, Behold, I <i>am</i> at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised <i>his</i> birthright.</p>
