# Job 41

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord <i>which</i> thou lettest down?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft <i>words</i> unto thee?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Wilt thou play with him as <i>with</i> a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not <i>one</i> be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; None <i>is so</i> fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Who hath prevented me, that I should repay <i>him? whatsoever is</i> under the whole heaven is mine.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who can discover the face of his garment? <i>or</i> who can come <i>to him</i> with his double bridle?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth <i>are</i> terrible round about.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>His</i> scales <i>are his</i> pride, shut up together <i>as with</i> a close seal.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes <i>are</i> like the eyelids of the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Out of his mouth go burning lamps, <i>and</i> sparks of fire leap out.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <i>out</i> of a seething pot or caldron.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <i>millstone</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He esteemeth iron as straw, <i>and</i> brass as rotten wood.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Sharp stones <i>are</i> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; He maketh a path to shine after him; <i>one</i> would think the deep <i>to be</i> hoary.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; He beholdeth all high <i>things</i>: he <i>is</i> a king over all the children of pride.</p>
