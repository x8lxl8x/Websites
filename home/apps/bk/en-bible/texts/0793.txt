# Jeremiah 48

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded <i>and</i> taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>There shall be</i> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <i>being</i> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A voice of crying <i>shall be</i> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity <i>with</i> his priests and his princes together.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Cursed <i>be</i> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <i>be</i> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; How say ye, We <i>are</i> mighty and strong men for the war?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Moab is spoiled, and gone up <i>out of</i> her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The calamity of Moab <i>is</i> near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, <i>and</i> the beautiful rod!</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <i>thy</i> glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, <i>and</i> he shall destroy thy strong holds.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, <i>and</i> say, What is done?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Make ye him drunken: for he magnified <i>himself</i> against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove <i>that</i> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but <i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i> so; his lies shall not so effect <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; <i>mine heart</i> shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <i>even</i> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <i>their</i> shouting <i>shall be</i> no shouting.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; From the cry of Heshbon <i>even</i> unto Elealeh, <i>and even</i> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <i>even</i> unto Horonaim, <i>as</i> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches <i>that</i> he hath gotten are perished.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; For every head <i>shall be</i> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands <i>shall be</i> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; <i>There shall be</i> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; They shall howl, <i>saying</i>, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And Moab shall be destroyed from <i>being</i> a people, because he hath magnified <i>himself</i> against the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i>shall be</i> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <i>even</i> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far <i>is</i> the judgment of Moab.</p>
