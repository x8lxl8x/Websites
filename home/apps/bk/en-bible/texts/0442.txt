# Job 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the arrows of the Almighty <i>are</i> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <i>any</i> taste in the white of an egg?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The things <i>that</i> my soul refused to touch <i>are</i> as my sorrowful meat.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <i>me</i> the thing that I long for!</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; What <i>is</i> my strength, that I should hope? and what <i>is</i> mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>Is</i> my strength the strength of stones? or <i>is</i> my flesh of brass?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; To him that is afflicted pity <i>should be shewed</i> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, <i>and</i> as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Which are blackish by reason of the ice, <i>and</i> wherein the snow is hid:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For now ye are nothing; ye see <i>my</i> casting down, and are afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, <i>which are</i> as wind?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig <i>a pit</i> for your friend.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Now therefore be content, look upon me; for <i>it is</i> evident unto you if I lie.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness <i>is</i> in it.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>
