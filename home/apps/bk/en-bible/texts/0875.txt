# Hosea 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, <i>and</i> idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff <i>that</i> is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yet I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for <i>there is</i> no saviour beside me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe <i>them</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will meet them as a bear <i>that is</i> bereaved <i>of her whelps</i>, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me <i>is</i> thine help.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I will be thy king: where <i>is any other</i> that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took <i>him</i> away in my wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The iniquity of Ephraim <i>is</i> bound up; his sin <i>is</i> hid.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he <i>is</i> an unwise son; for he should not stay long in <i>the place of</i> the breaking forth of children.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Though he be fruitful among <i>his</i> brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</p>
