# Habakkuk 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <i>me</i> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <i>are</i> before me: and there are <i>that</i> raise up strife and contention.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days, <i>which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i>that</i> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <i>that are</i> not theirs.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They <i>are</i> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to eat.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <i>as</i> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then shall <i>his</i> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <i>imputing</i> this his power unto his god.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>Art</i> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>Thou art</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <i>and</i> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <i>the man that is</i> more righteous than he?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <i>that have</i> no ruler over them?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <i>is</i> fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p>
