# II Samuel 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for the LORD <i>is</i> with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whereas I have not dwelt in <i>any</i> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In all <i>the places</i> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <i>men</i> that <i>are</i> in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And as since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who <i>am</i> I, O Lord GOD? and what <i>is</i> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And <i>is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people, <i>even</i> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i>from</i> the nations and their gods?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <i>to be</i> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish <i>it</i> for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And now, O Lord GOD, thou <i>art</i> that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken <i>it</i>: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>
