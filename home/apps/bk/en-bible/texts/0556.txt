# Psalms 78

<p class="intro">Maschil of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give ear, O my people, <i>to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Therefore the LORD heard <i>this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; When God heard <i>this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|60]&ensp; So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men;</p>

<p>%[l|61]&ensp; And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>

<p>%[l|62]&ensp; He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|63]&ensp; The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>

<p>%[l|64]&ensp; Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>

<p>%[l|65]&ensp; Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>

<p>%[l|66]&ensp; And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|67]&ensp; Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>

<p>%[l|68]&ensp; But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>

<p>%[l|69]&ensp; And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|70]&ensp; He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>

<p>%[l|71]&ensp; From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|72]&ensp; So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
