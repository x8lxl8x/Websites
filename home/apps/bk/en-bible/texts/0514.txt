# Psalms 36

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David the servant of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, <i>that there is</i> no fear of God before his eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The words of his mouth <i>are</i> iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, <i>and</i> to do good.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way <i>that is</i> not good; he abhorreth not evil.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thy mercy, O LORD, <i>is</i> in the heavens; <i>and</i> thy faithfulness <i>reacheth</i> unto the clouds.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thy righteousness <i>is</i> like the great mountains; thy judgments <i>are</i> a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; How excellent <i>is</i> thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For with thee <i>is</i> the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</p>
