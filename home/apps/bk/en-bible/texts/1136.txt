# Hebrews 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses <i>was faithful</i> in all his house.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For this <i>man</i> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For every house is builded by some <i>man</i>; but he that built all things <i>is</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Moses verily <i>was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in <i>their</i> heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But with whom was he grieved forty years? <i>was it</i> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
