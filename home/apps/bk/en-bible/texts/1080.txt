# II Corinthians 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Sufficient to such a man <i>is</i> this punishment, which <i>was inflicted</i> of many.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So that contrariwise ye <i>ought</i> rather to forgive <i>him</i>, and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <i>your</i> love toward him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; To whom ye forgive any thing, I <i>forgive</i> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <i>it</i>, for your sakes <i>forgave I it</i> in the person of Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now thanks <i>be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; To the one <i>we are</i> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
