# Philippians 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <i>my</i> dearly beloved.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <i>with</i> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <i>are</i> in the book of life.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Rejoice in the Lord alway: <i>and</i> again I say, Rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <i>is</i> at hand.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <i>are</i> honest, whatsoever things <i>are</i> just, whatsoever things <i>are</i> pure, whatsoever things <i>are</i> lovely, whatsoever things <i>are</i> of good report; if <i>there be</i> any virtue, and if <i>there be</i> any praise, think on these things.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <i>therewith</i> to be content.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <i>which were sent</i> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now unto God and our Father <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</p>
