# Psalms 76

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In Judah <i>is</i> God known: his name <i>is</i> great in Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> more glorious <i>and</i> excellent than the mountains of prey.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou, <i>even</i> thou, <i>art</i> to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He shall cut off the spirit of princes: <i>he is</i> terrible to the kings of the earth.</p>
