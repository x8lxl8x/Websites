# Exodus 33

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, <i>and</i> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou <i>art</i> a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye <i>are</i> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, <i>that</i> every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which <i>was</i> without the camp.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <i>that</i> all the people rose up, and stood every man <i>at</i> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle, and <i>the LORD</i> talked with Moses.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <i>at</i> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <i>in</i> his tent door.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <i>is</i> thy people.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he said, My presence shall go <i>with thee</i>, and I will give thee rest.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <i>with me</i>, carry us not up hence.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <i>is it</i> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the LORD said, Behold, <i>there is</i> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</p>
