# Colossians 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Masters, give unto <i>your</i> servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let your speech <i>be</i> alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, <i>who is</i> a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is <i>one</i> of you. They shall make known unto you all things which <i>are done</i> here.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only <i>are my</i> fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Epaphras, who is <i>one</i> of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them <i>that are</i> in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the <i>epistle</i> from Laodicea.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</p>
