# Acts 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <i>even</i> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <i>is</i> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <i>men</i> glorified God for that which was done.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <i>art</i> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <i>of them</i> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And laid <i>them</i> down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <i>and</i> of the country of Cyprus,</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Having land, sold <i>it</i>, and brought the money, and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles' feet.</p>
