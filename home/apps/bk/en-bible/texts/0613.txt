# Psalms 135

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise <i>him</i>, O ye servants of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Praise the LORD; for the LORD <i>is</i> good: sing praises unto his name; for <i>it is</i> pleasant.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, <i>and</i> Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For I know that the LORD <i>is</i> great, and <i>that</i> our Lord <i>is</i> above all gods.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whatsoever the LORD pleased, <i>that</i> did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Who</i> sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And gave their land <i>for</i> an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy name, O LORD, <i>endureth</i> for ever; <i>and</i> thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The idols of the heathen <i>are</i> silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there <i>any</i> breath in their mouths.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They that make them are like unto them: <i>so is</i> every one that trusteth in them.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
