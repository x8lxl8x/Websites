# Psalms 50

<p class="intro">A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The mighty God, <i>even</i> the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God <i>is</i> judge himself. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I <i>am</i> God, <i>even</i> thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, <i>to have been</i> continually before me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will take no bullock out of thy house, <i>nor</i> he goats out of thy folds.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For every beast of the forest <i>is</i> mine, <i>and</i> the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field <i>are</i> mine.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world <i>is</i> mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or <i>that</i> thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thou sittest <i>and</i> speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; These <i>things</i> hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether <i>such an one</i> as thyself: <i>but</i> I will reprove thee, and set <i>them</i> in order before thine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear <i>you</i> in pieces, and <i>there be</i> none to deliver.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth <i>his</i> conversation <i>aright</i> will I shew the salvation of God.</p>
