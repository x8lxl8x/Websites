# Psalms 46

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; God <i>is</i> our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Though</i> the waters thereof roar <i>and</i> be troubled, <i>though</i> the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy <i>place</i> of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; God <i>is</i> in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, <i>and that</i> right early.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> with us; the God of Jacob <i>is</i> our refuge. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Be still, and know that I <i>am</i> God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> with us; the God of Jacob <i>is</i> our refuge. Selah.</p>
