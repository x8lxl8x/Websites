# Hebrews 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Let brotherly love continue.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; <i>and</i> them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Marriage <i>is</i> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Let your</i> conversation <i>be</i> without covetousness; <i>and be</i> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; So that we may boldly say, The Lord <i>is</i> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of <i>their</i> conversation.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For <i>it is</i> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <i>our</i> lips giving thanks to his name.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <i>is</i> unprofitable for you.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But I beseech <i>you</i> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Know ye that <i>our</i> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</p>
