# Deuteronomy 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; All these cities <i>were</i> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <i>was</i> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; (<i>Which</i> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <i>was</i> a bedstead of iron; <i>is</i> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <i>was</i> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And this land, <i>which</i> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <i>being</i> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <i>which is</i> the border of the children of Ammon;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <i>thereof</i>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <i>that are</i> meet for the war.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<i>for</i> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <i>until</i> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <i>then</i> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <i>is there</i> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <i>is</i> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <i>it</i> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</p>
