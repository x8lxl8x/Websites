# Psalms 15

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>He that</i> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <i>He that</i> sweareth to <i>his own</i> hurt, and changeth not.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>He that</i> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <i>things</i> shall never be moved.</p>
