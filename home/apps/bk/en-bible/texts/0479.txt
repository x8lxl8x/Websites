# Psalms 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But his delight <i>is</i> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The ungodly <i>are</i> not so: but <i>are</i> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
