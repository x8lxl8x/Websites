# II Timothy 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>men</i>, as theirs also was.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i>them</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
