# Psalms 148

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that <i>be</i> above the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory <i>is</i> above the earth and heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; <i>even</i> of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
