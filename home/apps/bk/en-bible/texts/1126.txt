# II Timothy 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To Timothy, <i>my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who hath saved us, and called <i>us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
