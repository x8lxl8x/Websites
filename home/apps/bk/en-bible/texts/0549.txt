# Psalms 71

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou <i>art</i> my rock and my fortress.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> my hope, O Lord GOD: <i>thou art</i> my trust from my youth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise <i>shall be</i> continually of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I am as a wonder unto many; but thou <i>art</i> my strong refuge.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let my mouth be filled <i>with</i> thy praise <i>and with</i> thy honour all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for <i>there is</i> none to deliver <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let them be confounded <i>and</i> consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered <i>with</i> reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness <i>and</i> thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers <i>thereof</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, <i>even</i> of thine only.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto <i>this</i> generation, <i>and</i> thy power to every one <i>that</i> is to come.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thy righteousness also, O God, <i>is</i> very high, who hast done great things: O God, who <i>is</i> like unto thee!</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>Thou</i>, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; I will also praise thee with the psaltery, <i>even</i> thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</p>
