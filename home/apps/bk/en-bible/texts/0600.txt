# Psalms 122

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Peace be within thy walls, <i>and</i> prosperity within thy palaces.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace <i>be</i> within thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.</p>
