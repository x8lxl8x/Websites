# Psalms 42

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where <i>is</i> thy God?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; When I remember these <i>things</i>, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and <i>why</i> art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him <i>for</i> the help of his countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song <i>shall be</i> with me, <i>and</i> my prayer unto the God of my life.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>As</i> with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where <i>is</i> thy God?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, <i>who is</i> the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
