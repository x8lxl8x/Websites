# Psalms 66

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Song <i>or</i> Psalm.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Say unto God, How terrible <i>art thou in</i> thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing <i>to</i> thy name. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Come and see the works of God: <i>he is</i> terrible <i>in his</i> doing toward the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He turned the sea into dry <i>land</i>: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Come <i>and</i> hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear <i>me</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>But</i> verily God hath heard <i>me</i>; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>
