# Esther 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and <i>upon</i> the isles of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For Mordecai the Jew <i>was</i> next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</p>
