# Job 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How long <i>will it be ere</i> ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Wherefore are we counted as beasts, <i>and</i> reputed vile in your sight?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The gin shall take <i>him</i> by the heel, <i>and</i> the robber shall prevail against him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The snare <i>is</i> laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction <i>shall be</i> ready at his side.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; It shall devour the strength of his skin: <i>even</i> the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because <i>it is</i> none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They that come after <i>him</i> shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Surely such <i>are</i> the dwellings of the wicked, and this <i>is</i> the place <i>of him that</i> knoweth not God.</p>
