# Habakkuk 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, his soul <i>which</i> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i>he is</i> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <i>is</i> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <i>that which is</i> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <i>for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <i>against</i> thy soul.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, <i>is it</i> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i>him</i>, and makest <i>him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <i>shall be</i> on thy glory.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <i>is</i> laid over with gold and silver, and <i>there is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But the LORD <i>is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p>
