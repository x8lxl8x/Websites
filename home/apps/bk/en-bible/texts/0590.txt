# Psalms 112

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise ye the LORD. Blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> feareth the LORD, <i>that</i> delighteth greatly in his commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Wealth and riches <i>shall be</i> in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: <i>he is</i> gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; His heart <i>is</i> established, he shall not be afraid, until he see <i>his desire</i> upon his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The wicked shall see <i>it</i>, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
