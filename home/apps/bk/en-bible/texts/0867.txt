# Hosea 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <i>is</i> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <i>have been</i> a rebuker of them all.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <i>and</i> Israel is defiled.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <i>is</i> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find <i>him</i>; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <i>and</i> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <i>at</i> Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <i>therefore</i> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ephraim <i>is</i> oppressed <i>and</i> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <i>saw</i> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For I <i>will be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <i>even</i> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I will go <i>and</i> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</p>
