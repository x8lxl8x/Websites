# Ecclesiastes 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; To every <i>thing there is</i> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <i>that which is</i> planted;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He hath made every <i>thing</i> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I know that <i>there is</i> no good in them, but for <i>a man</i> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <i>is</i> the gift of God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <i>it</i>, that <i>men</i> should fear before him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <i>that</i> wickedness <i>was</i> there; and the place of righteousness, <i>that</i> iniquity <i>was</i> there.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <i>there is</i> a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <i>is</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Wherefore I perceive that <i>there is</i> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <i>is</i> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
