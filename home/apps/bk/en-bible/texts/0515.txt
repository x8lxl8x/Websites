# Psalms 37

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Trust in the LORD, and do good; <i>so</i> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <i>it</i> to pass.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For yet a little while, and the wicked <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, <i>and</i> to slay such as be of upright conversation.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A little that a righteous man hath <i>is</i> better than the riches of many wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <i>shall be</i> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For <i>such as be</i> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <i>they that be</i> cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The steps of a <i>good</i> man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth <i>him with</i> his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I have been young, and <i>now</i> am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>He is</i> ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed <i>is</i> blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The law of his God <i>is</i> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <i>was</i> not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Mark the perfect <i>man</i>, and behold the upright: for the end of <i>that</i> man <i>is</i> peace.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; But the salvation of the righteous <i>is</i> of the LORD: <i>he is</i> their strength in the time of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</p>
