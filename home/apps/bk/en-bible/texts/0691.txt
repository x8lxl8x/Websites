# Isaiah 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Behold, God <i>is</i> my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> my strength and <i>my</i> song; he also is become my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this <i>is</i> known in all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great <i>is</i> the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</p>
