# Job 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Dominion and fear <i>are</i> with him, he maketh peace in his high places.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean <i>that is</i> born of a woman?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; How much less man, <i>that is</i> a worm? and the son of man, <i>which is</i> a worm?</p>
