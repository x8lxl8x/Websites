# Proverbs 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but <i>he that is</i> perverse in his ways despiseth him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; In the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Where no oxen <i>are</i>, the crib <i>is</i> clean: but much increase <i>is</i> by the strength of the ox.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; A scorner seeketh wisdom, and <i>findeth it</i> not: but knowledge <i>is</i> easy unto him that understandeth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not <i>in him</i> the lips of knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The wisdom of the prudent <i>is</i> to understand his way: but the folly of fools <i>is</i> deceit.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous <i>there is</i> favour.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth <i>is</i> heaviness.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man <i>shall be satisfied</i> from himself.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The simple believeth every word: but the prudent <i>man</i> looketh well to his going.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich <i>hath</i> many friends.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth <i>shall be</i> to them that devise good.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips <i>tendeth</i> only to penury.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The crown of the wise <i>is</i> their riches: <i>but</i> the foolishness of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful <i>witness</i> speaketh lies.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; In the fear of the LORD <i>is</i> strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; In the multitude of people <i>is</i> the king's honour: but in the want of people <i>is</i> the destruction of the prince.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> slow to wrath <i>is</i> of great understanding: but <i>he that is</i> hasty of spirit exalteth folly.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; A sound heart <i>is</i> the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but <i>that which is</i> in the midst of fools is made known.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin <i>is</i> a reproach to any people.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; The king's favour <i>is</i> toward a wise servant: but his wrath is <i>against</i> him that causeth shame.</p>
