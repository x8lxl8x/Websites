# Job 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves <i>are ready</i> for me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>Are there</i> not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> will strike hands with me?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He that speaketh flattery to <i>his</i> friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members <i>are</i> as a shadow.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Upright <i>men</i> shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find <i>one</i> wise <i>man</i> among you.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My days are past, my purposes are broken off, <i>even</i> the thoughts of my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They change the night into day: the light <i>is</i> short because of darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If I wait, the grave <i>is</i> mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have said to corruption, Thou <i>art</i> my father: to the worm, <i>Thou art</i> my mother, and my sister.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And where <i>is</i> now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when <i>our</i> rest together <i>is</i> in the dust.</p>
