# Ecclesiastes 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <i>themselves</i> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; As thou knowest not what <i>is</i> the way of the spirit, <i>nor</i> how the bones <i>do grow</i> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both <i>shall be</i> alike good.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Truly the light <i>is</i> sweet, and a pleasant <i>thing it is</i> for the eyes to behold the sun:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But if a man live many years, <i>and</i> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh <i>is</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these <i>things</i> God will bring thee into judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth <i>are</i> vanity.</p>
