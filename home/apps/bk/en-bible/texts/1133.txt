<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And to <i>our</i> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Yet for love's sake I rather beseech <i>thee</i>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <i>thee</i> ought, put that on mine account;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I Paul have written <i>it</i> with mine own hand, I will repay <i>it</i>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen.</p>
