# Ezekiel 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <i>thy</i> loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak <i>as</i> water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, <i>as</i> every tree.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it <i>shall be</i> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <i>thy</i> thigh.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Because <i>it is</i> a trial, and what if <i>the sword</i> contemn even the rod? it shall be no <i>more</i>, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <i>thine</i> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <i>is</i> the sword of the great <i>men that are</i> slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that <i>their</i> heart may faint, and <i>their</i> ruins be multiplied: ah! <i>it is</i> made bright, <i>it is</i> wrapped up for the slaughter.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Go thee one way or other, <i>either</i> on the right hand, <i>or</i> on the left, whithersoever thy face <i>is</i> set.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <i>it</i> at the head of the way to the city.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <i>his</i> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint <i>battering</i> rams against the gates, to cast a mount, <i>and</i> to build a fort.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, <i>I say</i>, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end,</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> the same: exalt <i>him that is</i> low, and abase <i>him that is</i> high.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no <i>more</i>, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <i>is</i> drawn: for the slaughter <i>it is</i> furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i>them that are</i> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Shall I cause <i>it</i> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i>and</i> skilful to destroy.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no <i>more</i> remembered: for I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</p>
