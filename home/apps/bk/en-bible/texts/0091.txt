# Leviticus 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <i>even</i> of the herd, and of the flock.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If his offering <i>be</i> a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that <i>is by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that <i>is</i> on the fire which <i>is</i> upon the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, <i>to be</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And if his offering <i>be</i> of the flocks, <i>namely</i>, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that <i>is</i> on the fire which <i>is</i> upon the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring <i>it</i> all, and burn <i>it</i> upon the altar: it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD <i>be</i> of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn <i>it</i> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, <i>but</i> shall not divide <i>it</i> asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that <i>is</i> upon the fire: it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
