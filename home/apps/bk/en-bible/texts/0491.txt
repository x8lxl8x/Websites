# Psalms 13

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <i>having</i> sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Consider <i>and</i> hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the <i>sleep of</i> death;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; <i>and</i> those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
