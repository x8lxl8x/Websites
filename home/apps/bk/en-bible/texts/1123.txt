# I Timothy 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Forbidding to marry, <i>and commanding</i> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For every creature of God <i>is</i> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself <i>rather</i> unto godliness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; This <i>is</i> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; These things command and teach.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
