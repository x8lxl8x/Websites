# Jonah 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, <i>and</i> thou heardest my voice.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The waters compassed me about, <i>even</i> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars <i>was</i> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay <i>that</i> that I have vowed. Salvation <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry <i>land</i>.</p>
