# John 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; That all <i>men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; I receive not honour from men.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <i>cometh</i> from God only?</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <i>one</i> that accuseth you, <i>even</i> Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>
