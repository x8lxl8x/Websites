# I Thessalonians 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians <i>which is</i> in God the Father and <i>in</i> the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, <i>even</i> Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
