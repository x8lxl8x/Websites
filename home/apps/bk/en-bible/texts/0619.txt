# Psalms 141

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let my prayer be set forth before thee <i>as</i> incense; <i>and</i> the lifting up of my hands <i>as</i> the evening sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Incline not my heart to <i>any</i> evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let the righteous smite me; <i>it shall be</i> a kindness: and let him reprove me; <i>it shall be</i> an excellent oil, <i>which</i> shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also <i>shall be</i> in their calamities.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth <i>wood</i> upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But mine eyes <i>are</i> unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Keep me from the snares <i>which</i> they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</p>
