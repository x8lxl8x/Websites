# Proverbs 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
