# Isaiah 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD, thou <i>art</i> my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful <i>things; thy</i> counsels of old <i>are</i> faithfulness <i>and</i> truth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For thou hast made of a city an heap; <i>of</i> a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones <i>is</i> as a storm <i>against</i> the wall.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; <i>even</i> the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this <i>is</i> our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this <i>is</i> the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <i>his hands</i> to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, <i>and</i> bring to the ground, <i>even</i> to the dust.</p>
