# Isaiah 47

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: <i>there is</i> no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet <i>thee as</i> a man.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>As for</i> our redeemer, the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name, the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: <i>so</i> that thou didst not lay these <i>things</i> to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore hear now this, <i>thou that art</i> given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I <i>am</i>, and none else beside me; I shall not sit <i>as</i> a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But these two <i>things</i> shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, <i>and</i> for the great abundance of thine enchantments.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I <i>am</i>, and none else beside me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, <i>which</i> thou shalt not know.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from <i>these things</i> that shall come upon thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <i>there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a coal to warm at, <i>nor</i> fire to sit before it.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, <i>even</i> thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.</p>
