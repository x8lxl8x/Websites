<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <i>Was</i> not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; A son honoureth <i>his</i> father, and a servant his master: if then I <i>be</i> a father, where <i>is</i> mine honour? and if I <i>be</i> a master, where <i>is</i> my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD <i>is</i> contemptible.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <i>is it</i> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <i>is it</i> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who <i>is there</i> even among you that would shut the doors <i>for nought</i>? neither do ye kindle <i>fire</i> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <i>shall be</i> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <i>shall be</i> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <i>shall be</i> great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD <i>is</i> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <i>even</i> his meat, <i>is</i> contemptible.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness <i>is it</i>! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought <i>that which was</i> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But cursed <i>be</i> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I <i>am</i> a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name <i>is</i> dreadful among the heathen.</p>
