# Luke 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <i>their</i> nets.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they beckoned unto <i>their</i> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; When Simon Peter saw <i>it</i>, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And so <i>was</i> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <i>his</i> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <i>present</i> to heal them.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <i>means</i> to bring him in, and to lay <i>him</i> before him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And when they could not find by what <i>way</i> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <i>his</i> couch into the midst before Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <i>the disciples</i> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <i>taken</i> out of the new agreeth not with the old.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; No man also having drunk old <i>wine</i> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</p>
