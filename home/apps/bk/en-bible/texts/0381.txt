# II Chronicles 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Asa did <i>that which was</i> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For he took away the altars of the strange <i>gods</i>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <i>them</i> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <i>while</i> the land <i>is</i> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought <i>him</i>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Asa had an army <i>of men</i> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <i>were</i> mighty men of valour.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, <i>it is</i> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou <i>art</i> our God; let not man prevail against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Asa and the people that <i>were</i> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
