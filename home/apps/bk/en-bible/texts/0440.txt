# Job 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>If</i> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not <i>this</i> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Remember, I pray thee, who <i>ever</i> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <i>was</i> before mine eyes, <i>there was</i> silence, and I heard a voice, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; How much less <i>in</i> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <i>is</i> in the dust, <i>which</i> are crushed before the moth?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Doth not their excellency <i>which is</i> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>
