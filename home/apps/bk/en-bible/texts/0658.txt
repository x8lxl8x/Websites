# Proverbs 30

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <i>even</i> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Surely I <i>am</i> more brutish than <i>any</i> man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <i>is</i> his name, and what <i>is</i> his son's name, if thou canst tell?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Every word of God <i>is</i> pure: he <i>is</i> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Two <i>things</i> have I required of thee; deny me <i>them</i> not before I die:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Lest I be full, and deny <i>thee</i>, and say, Who <i>is</i> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <i>in vain</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation <i>that</i> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation <i>that are</i> pure in their own eyes, and <i>yet</i> is not washed from their filthiness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation, whose teeth <i>are as</i> swords, and their jaw teeth <i>as</i> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <i>among</i> men.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The horseleach hath two daughters, <i>crying</i>, Give, give. There are three <i>things that</i> are never satisfied, <i>yea</i>, four <i>things</i> say not, <i>It is</i> enough:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <i>that</i> is not filled with water; and the fire <i>that</i> saith not, <i>It is</i> enough.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The eye <i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father, and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; There be three <i>things which</i> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Such <i>is</i> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For three <i>things</i> the earth is disquieted, and for four <i>which</i> it cannot bear:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For an odious <i>woman</i> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they <i>are</i> exceeding wise:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The ants <i>are</i> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; There be three <i>things</i> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; A lion <i>which is</i> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>
