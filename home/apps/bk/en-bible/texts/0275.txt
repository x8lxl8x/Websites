# II Samuel 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And <i>so</i> the Moabites became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And David took from him a thousand <i>chariots</i>, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them <i>for</i> an hundred chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, <i>and</i> brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And <i>Joram</i> brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And David gat <i>him</i> a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, <i>being</i> eighteen thousand <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <i>was</i> recorder;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Seraiah <i>was</i> the scribe;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was over</i> both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</p>
