# Exodus 30

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: <i>of</i> shittim wood shalt thou make it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A cubit <i>shall be</i> the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits <i>shall be</i> the height thereof: the horns thereof <i>shall be</i> of the same.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make <i>it</i>; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And thou shalt make the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And thou shalt put it before the vail that <i>is</i> by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that <i>is</i> over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it <i>is</i> most holy unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when <i>thou</i> numberest them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel <i>is</i> twenty gerahs:) an half shekel <i>shall be</i> the offering of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when <i>they</i> give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thou shalt also make a laver <i>of</i> brass, and his foot <i>also of</i> brass, to wash <i>withal</i>: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, <i>even</i> to him and to his seed throughout their generations.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred <i>shekels</i>, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, <i>even</i> two hundred and fifty <i>shekels</i>, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty <i>shekels</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And of cassia five hundred <i>shekels</i>, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that <i>they</i> may minister unto me in the priest's office.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make <i>any other</i> like it, after the composition of it: it <i>is</i> holy, <i>and</i> it shall be holy unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Whosoever compoundeth <i>any</i> like it, or whosoever putteth <i>any</i> of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; <i>these</i> sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like <i>weight</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure <i>and</i> holy:</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And thou shalt beat <i>some</i> of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And <i>as for</i> the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>
