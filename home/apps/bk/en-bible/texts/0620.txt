# Psalms 142

<p class="intro">Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I looked on <i>my</i> right hand, and beheld, but <i>there was</i> no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <i>art</i> my refuge <i>and</i> my portion in the land of the living.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</p>
