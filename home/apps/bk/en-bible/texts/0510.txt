# Psalms 32

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David, Maschil.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>is he whose</i> transgression <i>is</i> forgiven, <i>whose</i> sin <i>is</i> covered.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <i>there is</i> no guile.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Be ye not as the horse, <i>or</i> as the mule, <i>which</i> have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Many sorrows <i>shall be</i> to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <i>ye that are</i> upright in heart.</p>
