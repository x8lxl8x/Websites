# Jeremiah 49

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why <i>then</i> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <i>and</i> his priests and his princes together.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <i>saying</i>, Who shall come unto me?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <i>Is</i> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <i>that</i> I will visit him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <i>some</i> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he <i>is</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <i>them</i> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment <i>was</i> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <i>art</i> thou he <i>that</i> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink <i>of it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, <i>saying</i>, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <i>and</i> despised among men.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <i>and</i> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <i>cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who <i>is</i> a chosen <i>man, that</i> I may appoint over her? for who <i>is</i> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <i>is</i> that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <i>there is</i> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Damascus is waxed feeble, <i>and</i> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on <i>her</i>: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <i>is</i> on every side.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, <i>which</i> dwell alone.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <i>and</i> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <i>any</i> son of man dwell in it.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, <i>even</i> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <i>that</i> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</p>
