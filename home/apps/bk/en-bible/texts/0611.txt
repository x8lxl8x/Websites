# Psalms 133

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold, how good and how pleasant <i>it is</i> for brethren to dwell together in unity!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>It is</i> like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, <i>even</i> Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; As the dew of Hermon, <i>and as the dew</i> that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, <i>even</i> life for evermore.</p>
