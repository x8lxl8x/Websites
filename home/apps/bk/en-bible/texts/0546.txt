# Psalms 68

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As smoke is driven away, <i>so</i> drive <i>them</i> away: as wax melteth before the fire, <i>so</i> let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, <i>is</i> God in his holy habitation.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry <i>land</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: <i>even</i> Sinai itself <i>was moved</i> at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The Lord gave the word: great <i>was</i> the company of those that published <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Though ye have lien among the pots, <i>yet shall ye be as</i> the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was <i>white</i> as snow in Salmon.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The hill of God <i>is as</i> the hill of Bashan; an high hill <i>as</i> the hill of Bashan.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Why leap ye, ye high hills? <i>this is</i> the hill <i>which</i> God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell <i>in it</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The chariots of God <i>are</i> twenty thousand, <i>even</i> thousands of angels: the Lord <i>is</i> among them, <i>as in</i> Sinai, in the holy <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, <i>for</i> the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell <i>among them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord, <i>who</i> daily loadeth us <i>with benefits, even</i> the God of our salvation. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> our God <i>is</i> the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord <i>belong</i> the issues from death.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But God shall wound the head of his enemies, <i>and</i> the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring <i>my people</i> again from the depths of the sea:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of <i>thine</i> enemies, <i>and</i> the tongue of thy dogs in the same.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; They have seen thy goings, O God; <i>even</i> the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The singers went before, the players on instruments <i>followed</i> after; among <i>them were</i> the damsels playing with timbrels.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Bless ye God in the congregations, <i>even</i> the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; There <i>is</i> little Benjamin <i>with</i> their ruler, the princes of Judah <i>and</i> their council, the princes of Zebulun, <i>and</i> the princes of Naphtali.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, <i>till every one</i> submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people <i>that</i> delight in war.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, <i>which were</i> of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, <i>and that</i> a mighty voice.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency <i>is</i> over Israel, and his strength <i>is</i> in the clouds.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; O God, <i>thou art</i> terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel <i>is</i> he that giveth strength and power unto <i>his</i> people. Blessed <i>be</i> God.</p>
