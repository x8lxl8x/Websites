# Jeremiah 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <i>woman</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch <i>their</i> tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <i>is</i> the city to be visited; she <i>is</i> wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually <i>is</i> grief and wounds.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear <i>is</i> uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with <i>him that is</i> full of days.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And their houses shall be turned unto others, <i>with their</i> fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one <i>is</i> given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They have healed also the hurt <i>of the daughter</i> of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <i>there is</i> no peace.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time <i>that</i> I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where <i>is</i> the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk <i>therein</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Also I set watchmen over you, <i>saying</i>, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what <i>is</i> among them.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, <i>even</i> the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings <i>are</i> not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they <i>are</i> cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, <i>and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy <i>and</i> fear <i>is</i> on every side.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; O daughter of my people, gird <i>thee</i> with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, <i>as for</i> an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; I have set thee <i>for</i> a tower <i>and</i> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; They <i>are</i> all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: <i>they are</i> brass and iron; they <i>are</i> all corrupters.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Reprobate silver shall <i>men</i> call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.</p>
