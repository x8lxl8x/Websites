# Proverbs 28

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the transgression of a land many <i>are</i> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <i>and</i> knowledge the state <i>thereof</i> shall be prolonged.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A poor man that oppresseth the poor <i>is like</i> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways, though he <i>be</i> rich.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Whoso keepeth the law <i>is</i> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <i>men</i> shameth his father.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <i>shall be</i> abomination.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <i>things</i> in possession.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The rich man <i>is</i> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When righteous <i>men</i> do rejoice, <i>there is</i> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <i>them</i> shall have mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; <i>As</i> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <i>so is</i> a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The prince that wanteth understanding <i>is</i> also a great oppressor: <i>but</i> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <i>his</i> days.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; A man that doeth violence to the blood of <i>any</i> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways shall fall at once.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <i>persons</i> shall have poverty enough.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; To have respect of persons <i>is</i> not good: for for a piece of bread <i>that</i> man will transgress.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He that hasteth to be rich <i>hath</i> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <i>It is</i> no transgression; the same <i>is</i> the companion of a destroyer.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
