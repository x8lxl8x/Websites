# Genesis 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <i>them</i>, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <i>it</i>, and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave <i>it</i> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set <i>it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And they said unto him, Where <i>is</i> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <i>it</i> in the tent door, which <i>was</i> behind him.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Now Abraham and Sarah <i>were</i> old <i>and</i> well stricken in age; <i>and</i> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <i>are</i> therein?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <i>am but</i> dust and ashes:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <i>lack of</i> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it</i> for forty's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he said <i>unto him</i>, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it</i>, if I find thirty there.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for twenty's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for ten's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
