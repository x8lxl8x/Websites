# I John 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <i>spirit</i> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; We love him, because he first loved us.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</p>
