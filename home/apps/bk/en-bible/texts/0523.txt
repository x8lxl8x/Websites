# Psalms 45

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue <i>is</i> the pen of a ready writer.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Gird thy sword upon <i>thy</i> thigh, O <i>most</i> mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness <i>and</i> righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thine arrows <i>are</i> sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; <i>whereby</i> the people fall under thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thy throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <i>is</i> a right sceptre.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; All thy garments <i>smell</i> of myrrh, and aloes, <i>and</i> cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Kings' daughters <i>were</i> among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he <i>is</i> thy Lord; and worship thou him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the daughter of Tyre <i>shall be there</i> with a gift; <i>even</i> the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The king's daughter <i>is</i> all glorious within: her clothing <i>is</i> of wrought gold.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</p>
