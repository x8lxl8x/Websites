# Micah 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <i>though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <i>yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <i>that is</i> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <i>have been</i> from of old, from everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore will he give them up, until the time <i>that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And this <i>man</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <i>us</i> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <i>more</i> soothsayers:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</p>
