# Numbers 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of <i>their</i> fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod <i>shall be</i> for the head of the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, <i>even</i> twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron <i>was</i> among their rods.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Moses did <i>so</i>: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</p>
