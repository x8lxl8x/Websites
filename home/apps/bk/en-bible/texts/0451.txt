# Job 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Art</i> thou the first man <i>that</i> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; What knowest thou, that we know not? <i>what</i> understandest thou, which <i>is</i> not in us?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; With us <i>are</i> both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>Are</i> the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest <i>such</i> words go out of thy mouth?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; What <i>is</i> man, that he should be clean? and <i>he which is</i> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; How much more abominable and filthy <i>is</i> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I will shew thee, hear me; and that <i>which</i> I have seen I will declare;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid <i>it</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The wicked man travaileth with pain all <i>his</i> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; A dreadful sound <i>is</i> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He wandereth abroad for bread, <i>saying</i>, Where <i>is it</i>? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He runneth upon him, <i>even</i> on <i>his</i> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on <i>his</i> flanks.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he dwelleth in desolate cities, <i>and</i> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; For the congregation of hypocrites <i>shall be</i> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p>
