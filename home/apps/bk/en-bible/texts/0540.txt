# Psalms 62

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him <i>cometh</i> my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He only <i>is</i> my rock and my salvation; <i>he is</i> my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall <i>shall ye be, and as</i> a tottering fence.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They only consult to cast <i>him</i> down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <i>is</i> from him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He only <i>is</i> my rock and my salvation: <i>he is</i> my defence; I shall not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In God <i>is</i> my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, <i>and</i> my refuge, <i>is</i> in God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Trust in him at all times; <i>ye</i> people, pour out your heart before him: God <i>is</i> a refuge for us. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Surely men of low degree <i>are</i> vanity, <i>and</i> men of high degree <i>are</i> a lie: to be laid in the balance, they <i>are</i> altogether <i>lighter</i> than vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart <i>upon them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power <i>belongeth</i> unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Also unto thee, O Lord, <i>belongeth</i> mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>
