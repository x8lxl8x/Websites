# Psalms 53

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The fool hath said in his heart, <i>There is</i> no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: <i>there is</i> none that doeth good.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were <i>any</i> that did understand, that did seek God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; <i>there is</i> none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <i>as</i> they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; There were they in great fear, <i>where</i> no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth <i>against</i> thee: thou hast put <i>them</i> to shame, because God hath despised them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Oh that the salvation of Israel <i>were come</i> out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <i>and</i> Israel shall be glad.</p>
