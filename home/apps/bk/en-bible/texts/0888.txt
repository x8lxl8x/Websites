# Amos 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the Lord GOD of hosts <i>is</i> he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as <i>by</i> the flood of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>It is</i> he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD <i>is</i> his name.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Are</i> ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD <i>are</i> upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as <i>corn</i> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit <i>them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.</p>
