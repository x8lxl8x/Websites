# Proverbs 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof <i>is</i> brutish.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A good <i>man</i> obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; A virtuous woman <i>is</i> a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed <i>is</i> as rottenness in his bones.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The thoughts of the righteous <i>are</i> right: <i>but</i> the counsels of the wicked <i>are</i> deceit.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The words of the wicked <i>are</i> to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The wicked are overthrown, and <i>are</i> not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> despised, and hath a servant, <i>is</i> better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; A righteous <i>man</i> regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked <i>are</i> cruel.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain <i>persons is</i> void of understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The wicked desireth the net of evil <i>men</i>: but the root of the righteous yieldeth <i>fruit</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The wicked is snared by the transgression of <i>his</i> lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of <i>his</i> mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The way of a fool <i>is</i> right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel <i>is</i> wise.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent <i>man</i> covereth shame.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>He that</i> speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise <i>is</i> health.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue <i>is</i> but for a moment.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Deceit <i>is</i> in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace <i>is</i> joy.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Lying lips <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly <i>are</i> his delight.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The righteous <i>is</i> more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The slothful <i>man</i> roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man <i>is</i> precious.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; In the way of righteousness <i>is</i> life; and <i>in</i> the pathway <i>thereof there is</i> no death.</p>
