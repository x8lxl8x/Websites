# Job 28

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold <i>where</i> they fine <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass <i>is</i> molten <i>out of</i> the stone.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; <i>even the waters</i> forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>As for</i> the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The stones of it <i>are</i> the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and <i>the thing that is</i> hid bringeth he forth to light.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But where shall wisdom be found? and where <i>is</i> the place of understanding?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The depth saith, It <i>is</i> not in me: and the sea saith, <i>It is</i> not with me.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed <i>for</i> the price thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it <i>shall not be for</i> jewels of fine gold.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom <i>is</i> above rubies.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Whence then cometh wisdom? and where <i>is</i> the place of understanding?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For he looketh to the ends of the earth, <i>and</i> seeth under the whole heaven;</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <i>is</i> wisdom; and to depart from evil <i>is</i> understanding.</p>
