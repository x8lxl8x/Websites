# Genesis 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I <i>am</i> thy shield, <i>and</i> thy exceeding great reward.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house <i>is</i> this Eliezer of Damascus?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And, behold, the word of the LORD <i>came</i> unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he said unto him, I <i>am</i> the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land <i>that is</i> not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is</i> not yet full.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</p>
