# Ephesians 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; (For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <i>see</i> that she reverence <i>her</i> husband.</p>
