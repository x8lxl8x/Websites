# Proverbs 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I was my father's son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Take fast hold of instruction; let <i>her</i> not go: keep her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
