# Romans 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <i>is there</i> of circumcision?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i>Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And not <i>rather</i>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; What then? are we better <i>than they</i>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <i>is</i> under their lips:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Destruction and misery <i>are</i> in their ways:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the way of peace have they not known:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Even the righteousness of God <i>which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Whom God hath set forth <i>to be</i> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; To declare, <i>I say</i>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Where <i>is</i> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; <i>Is he</i> the God of the Jews only? <i>is he</i> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Seeing <i>it is</i> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>
