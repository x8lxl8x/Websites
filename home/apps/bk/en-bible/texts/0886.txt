# Amos 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, <i>it was</i> the latter growth after the king's mowings.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i>is</i> small.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i>is</i> small.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i>made</i> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <i>is</i> the king's chapel, and it <i>is</i> the king's court.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <i>was</i> no prophet, neither <i>was</i> I a prophet's son; but I <i>was</i> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <i>thy word</i> against the house of Isaac.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p>
