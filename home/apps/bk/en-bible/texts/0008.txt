# Genesis 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that <i>was</i> with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <i>month</i>, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <i>were</i> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth <i>was</i> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first <i>month</i>, the first <i>day</i> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And God spake unto Noah, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Bring forth with thee every living thing that <i>is</i> with thee, of all flesh, <i>both</i> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, <i>and</i> whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart <i>is</i> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p>
