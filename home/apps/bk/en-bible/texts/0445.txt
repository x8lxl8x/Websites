# Job 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I know <i>it is</i> so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; <i>He is</i> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened <i>himself</i> against him, and hath prospered?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Lo, he goeth by me, and I see <i>him</i> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>If</i> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; How much less shall I answer him, <i>and</i> choose out my words <i>to reason</i> with him?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Whom, though I were righteous, <i>yet</i> would I not answer, <i>but</i> I would make supplication to my judge.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; If I had called, and he had answered me; <i>yet</i> would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; If <i>I speak</i> of strength, lo, <i>he is</i> strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time <i>to plead</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: <i>if I say</i>, I <i>am</i> perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>Though</i> I <i>were</i> perfect, <i>yet</i> would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; This <i>is</i> one <i>thing</i>, therefore I said <i>it</i>, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, <i>and</i> who <i>is</i> he?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to the prey.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort <i>myself</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; <i>If</i> I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For <i>he is</i> not a man, as I <i>am, that</i> I should answer him, <i>and</i> we should come together in judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, <i>that</i> might lay his hand upon us both.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; <i>Then</i> would I speak, and not fear him; but <i>it is</i> not so with me.</p>
