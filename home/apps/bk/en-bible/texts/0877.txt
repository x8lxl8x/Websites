# Joel 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Tell ye your children of it, and <i>let</i> your children <i>tell</i> their children, and their children another generation.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth <i>are</i> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast <i>it</i> away; the branches thereof are made white.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <i>even</i> all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders <i>and</i> all the inhabitants of the land <i>into</i> the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, <i>yea</i>, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p>
