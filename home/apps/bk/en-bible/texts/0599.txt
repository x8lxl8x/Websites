# Psalms 121

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My help <i>cometh</i> from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> thy keeper: the LORD <i>is</i> thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.</p>
