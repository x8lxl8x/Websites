# II Samuel 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i>that</i> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he said, The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <i>he is</i> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will call on the LORD, <i>who is</i> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <i>did enter</i> into his ears.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He delivered me from my strong enemy, <i>and</i> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For all his judgments <i>were</i> before me: and <i>as for</i> his statutes, I did not depart from them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <i>and</i> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes <i>are</i> upon the haughty, <i>that</i> thou mayest bring <i>them</i> down.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; <i>As for</i> God, his way <i>is</i> perfect; the word of the LORD <i>is</i> tried: he <i>is</i> a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; For who <i>is</i> God, save the LORD? and who <i>is</i> a rock, save our God?</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; God <i>is</i> my strength <i>and</i> power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; He maketh my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>: and setteth me upon my high places.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; They looked, but <i>there was</i> none to save; <i>even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, <i>and</i> did spread them abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me <i>to be</i> head of the heathen: a people <i>which</i> I knew not shall serve me.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; It <i>is</i> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; <i>He is</i> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
