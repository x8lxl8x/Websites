# Galatians 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all <i>men</i>, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <i>be</i> on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen.</p>
