# Genesis 20

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She <i>is</i> my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou <i>art but</i> a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she <i>is</i> a man's wife.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Said he not unto me, She <i>is</i> my sister? and she, even she herself said, He <i>is</i> my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Now therefore restore the man <i>his</i> wife; for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore <i>her</i> not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that <i>are</i> thine.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And yet indeed <i>she is</i> my sister; she <i>is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This <i>is</i> thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He <i>is</i> my brother.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave <i>them</i> unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Abimelech said, Behold, my land <i>is</i> before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver: behold, he <i>is</i> to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that <i>are</i> with thee, and with all <i>other</i>: thus she was reproved.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare <i>children</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p>
