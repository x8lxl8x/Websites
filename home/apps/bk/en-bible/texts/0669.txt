# Ecclesiastes 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: <i>so doth</i> a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom <i>and</i> honour.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A wise man's heart <i>is</i> at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth <i>him</i>, and he saith to every one <i>that</i> he <i>is</i> a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; There is an evil <i>which</i> I have seen under the sun, as an error <i>which</i> proceedeth from the ruler:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; <i>and</i> he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom <i>is</i> profitable to direct.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The words of a wise man's mouth <i>are</i> gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The beginning of the words of his mouth <i>is</i> foolishness: and the end of his talk <i>is</i> mischievous madness.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
