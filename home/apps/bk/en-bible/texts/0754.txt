# Jeremiah 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they <i>be</i> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they bend their tongues <i>like</i> their bow <i>for</i> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, <i>and</i> weary themselves to commit iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thine habitation <i>is</i> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Their tongue <i>is as</i> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: <i>one</i> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Shall I not visit them for these <i>things</i>? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through <i>them</i>; neither can <i>men</i> hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <i>and</i> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> the wise man, that may understand this? and <i>who is he</i> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth <i>and</i> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, <i>even</i> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning <i>women</i>, that they may come:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast <i>us</i> out.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For death is come up into our windows, <i>and</i> is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, <i>and</i> the young men from the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might, let not the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <i>am</i> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <i>things</i> I delight, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <i>them which are</i> circumcised with the uncircumcised;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <i>these</i> nations <i>are</i> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <i>are</i> uncircumcised in the heart.</p>
