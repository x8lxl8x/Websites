# Ezekiel 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Now <i>is</i> the end <i>come</i> upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble <i>is</i> near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations <i>that</i> are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD that smiteth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them <i>shall remain</i>, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <i>shall there be</i> wailing for them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision <i>is</i> touching the whole multitude thereof, <i>which</i> shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The sword <i>is</i> without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that <i>is</i> in the field shall die with the sword; and he that <i>is</i> in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak <i>as</i> water.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They shall also gird <i>themselves</i> with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame <i>shall be</i> upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations <i>and</i> of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret <i>place</i>: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <i>there shall be</i> none.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>
