# John 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And they which heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even <i>the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he</i>, and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And because I tell <i>you</i> the truth, ye believe me not.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear <i>them</i> not, because ye are not of God.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>
