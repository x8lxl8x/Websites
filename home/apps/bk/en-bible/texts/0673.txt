# Song of Solomon 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the rose of Sharon, <i>and</i> the lily of the valleys.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As the lily among thorns, so <i>is</i> my love among the daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so <i>is</i> my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit <i>was</i> sweet to my taste.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me <i>was</i> love.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I <i>am</i> sick of love.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; His left hand <i>is</i> under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <i>my</i> love, till he please.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over <i>and</i> gone;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing <i>of birds</i> is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines <i>with</i> the tender grape give a <i>good</i> smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; O my dove, <i>that art</i> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret <i>places</i> of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet <i>is</i> thy voice, and thy countenance <i>is</i> comely.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines <i>have</i> tender grapes.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; My beloved <i>is</i> mine, and I <i>am</i> his: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</p>
