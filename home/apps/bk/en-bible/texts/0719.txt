# Isaiah 40

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see <i>it</i> together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh <i>is</i> grass, and all the goodliness thereof <i>is</i> as the flower of the field:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people <i>is</i> grass.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift <i>it</i> up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong <i>hand</i>, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward <i>is</i> with him, and his work before him.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry <i>them</i> in his bosom, <i>and</i> shall gently lead those that are with young.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or <i>being</i> his counsellor hath taught him?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; With whom took he counsel, and <i>who</i> instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Behold, the nations <i>are</i> as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Lebanon <i>is</i> not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; All nations before him <i>are</i> as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He that <i>is</i> so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree <i>that</i> will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, <i>that</i> shall not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>It is</i> he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof <i>are</i> as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these <i>things</i>, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that <i>he is</i> strong in power; not one faileth.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, <i>that</i> the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? <i>there is</i> no searching of his understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He giveth power to the faint; and to <i>them that have</i> no might he increaseth strength.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew <i>their</i> strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; <i>and</i> they shall walk, and not faint.</p>
