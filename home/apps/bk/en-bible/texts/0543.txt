# Psalms 65

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm <i>and</i> Song of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Iniquities prevail against me: <i>as for</i> our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Blessed <i>is the man whom</i> thou choosest, and causest to approach <i>unto thee, that</i> he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, <i>even</i> of thy holy temple.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>By</i> terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; <i>who art</i> the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off <i>upon</i> the sea:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; <i>being</i> girded with power:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, <i>which</i> is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They drop <i>upon</i> the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.</p>
