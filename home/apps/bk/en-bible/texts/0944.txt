# Matthew 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <i>his</i> father or <i>his</i> mother, <i>It is</i> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And honour not his father or his mother, <i>he shall be free</i>. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Ye</i> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But in vain they do worship me, teaching <i>for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i>it</i> to dogs.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great <i>is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i>those that were</i> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Then Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <i>them</i>, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets full.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</p>
