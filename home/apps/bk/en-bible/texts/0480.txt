# Psalms 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Ask of me, and I shall give <i>thee</i> the heathen <i>for</i> thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth <i>for</i> thy possession.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <i>from</i> the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <i>are</i> all they that put their trust in him.</p>
