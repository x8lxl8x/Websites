<p>%[l|1]&ensp; James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Knowing <i>this</i>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But let patience have <i>her</i> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i>men</i> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; A double minded man <i>is</i> unstable in all his ways.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <i>therein</i>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion <i>is</i> vain.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <i>and</i> to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
