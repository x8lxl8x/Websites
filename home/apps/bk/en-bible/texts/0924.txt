# Zechariah 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <i>that</i> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But he shall say, I <i>am</i> no prophet, I <i>am</i> an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And <i>one</i> shall say unto him, What <i>are</i> these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, <i>Those</i> with which I was wounded <i>in</i> the house of my friends.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <i>that is</i> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off <i>and</i> die; but the third shall be left therein.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It <i>is</i> my people: and they shall say, The LORD <i>is</i> my God.</p>
