# Job 21

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; As for me, <i>is</i> my complaint to man? and if <i>it were so</i>, why should not my spirit be troubled?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Mark me, and be astonished, and lay <i>your</i> hand upon <i>your</i> mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Their houses <i>are</i> safe from fear, neither <i>is</i> the rod of God upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; What <i>is</i> the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Lo, their good <i>is</i> not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and <i>how oft</i> cometh their destruction upon them! <i>God</i> distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For what pleasure <i>hath</i> he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Shall <i>any</i> teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices <i>which</i> ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For ye say, Where <i>is</i> the house of the prince? and where <i>are</i> the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him <i>what</i> he hath done?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as <i>there are</i> innumerable before him.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</p>
