# Psalms 115

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, <i>and</i> for thy truth's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <i>is</i> now their God?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But our God <i>is</i> in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Their idols <i>are</i> silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They that make them are like unto them; <i>so is</i> every one that trusteth in them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he <i>is</i> their help and their shield.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he <i>is</i> their help and their shield.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he <i>is</i> their help and their shield.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless <i>us</i>; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He will bless them that fear the LORD, <i>both</i> small and great.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Ye <i>are</i> blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The heaven, <i>even</i> the heavens, <i>are</i> the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.</p>
