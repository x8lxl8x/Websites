# Mark 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash <i>their</i> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And <i>when they come</i> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <i>as</i> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching <i>for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, <i>as</i> the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, <i>It is</i> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <i>he shall be free</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And when he had called all the people <i>unto him</i>, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one <i>of you</i>, and understand:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, <i>it</i> cannot defile him;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <i>it</i>: but he could not be hid.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For a <i>certain</i> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i>it</i> unto the dogs.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <i>it</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
