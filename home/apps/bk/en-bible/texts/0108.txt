# Leviticus 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover <i>their</i> nakedness: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she <i>is</i> thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it <i>is</i> thy father's nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, <i>whether she be</i> born at home, or born abroad, <i>even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, <i>even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs <i>is</i> thine own nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she <i>is</i> thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she <i>is</i> thy father's near kinswoman.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she <i>is</i> thy mother's near kinswoman.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she <i>is</i> thine aunt.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she <i>is</i> thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it <i>is</i> thy brother's nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; <i>for</i> they <i>are</i> her near kinswomen: it <i>is</i> wickedness.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex <i>her</i>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life <i>time</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through <i>the fire</i> to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it <i>is</i> abomination.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it <i>is</i> confusion.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit <i>any</i> of these abominations; <i>neither</i> any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which <i>were</i> before you, and the land is defiled;)</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that <i>were</i> before you.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit <i>them</i> shall be cut off from among their people.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that <i>ye</i> commit not <i>any one</i> of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>
