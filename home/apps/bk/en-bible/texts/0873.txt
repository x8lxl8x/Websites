# Hosea 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When Israel <i>was</i> a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>As</i> they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour <i>them</i>, because of their own counsels.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? <i>how</i> shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? <i>how</i> shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I <i>am</i> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</p>
