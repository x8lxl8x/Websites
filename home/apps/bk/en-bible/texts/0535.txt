# Psalms 57

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until <i>these</i> calamities be overpast.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth <i>all things</i> for me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He shall send from heaven, and save me <i>from</i> the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My soul <i>is</i> among lions: <i>and</i> I lie <i>even among</i> them that are set on fire, <i>even</i> the sons of men, whose teeth <i>are</i> spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; <i>let</i> thy glory <i>be</i> above all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen <i>themselves</i>. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I <i>myself</i> will awake early.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thy mercy <i>is</i> great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: <i>let</i> thy glory <i>be</i> above all the earth.</p>
