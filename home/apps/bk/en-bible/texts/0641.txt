# Proverbs 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A wise son <i>heareth</i> his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; A man shall eat good by the fruit of <i>his</i> mouth: but the soul of the transgressors <i>shall eat</i> violence.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: <i>but</i> he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The soul of the sluggard desireth, and <i>hath</i> nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A righteous <i>man</i> hateth lying: but a wicked <i>man</i> is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Righteousness keepeth <i>him that is</i> upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; There is that maketh himself rich, yet <i>hath</i> nothing: <i>there is</i> that maketh himself poor, yet <i>hath</i> great riches.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The ransom of a man's life <i>are</i> his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised <i>is</i> wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wealth <i>gotten</i> by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but <i>when</i> the desire cometh, <i>it is</i> a tree of life.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The law of the wise <i>is</i> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors <i>is</i> hard.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Every prudent <i>man</i> dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open <i>his</i> folly.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador <i>is</i> health.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Poverty and shame <i>shall be to</i> him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but <i>it is</i> abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He that walketh with wise <i>men</i> shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; A good <i>man</i> leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner <i>is</i> laid up for the just.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Much food <i>is in</i> the tillage of the poor: but there is <i>that is</i> destroyed for want of judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.</p>
