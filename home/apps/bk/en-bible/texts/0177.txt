# Deuteronomy 24

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give <i>it</i> in her hand, and send her out of his house.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's <i>wife</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And <i>if</i> the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth <i>it</i> in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her <i>to be</i> his wife;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that <i>is</i> abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: <i>but</i> he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh <i>a man's</i> life to pledge.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, <i>so</i> ye shall observe to do.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if the man <i>be</i> poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant <i>that is</i> poor and needy, <i>whether he be</i> of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that <i>are</i> in thy land within thy gates:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; At his day thou shalt give <i>him</i> his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he <i>is</i> poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, <i>nor</i> of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean <i>it</i> afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>
