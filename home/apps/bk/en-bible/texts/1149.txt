# James 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same <i>is</i> a perfect man, <i>and</i> able also to bridle the whole body.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold also the ships, which though <i>they be</i> so great, and <i>are</i> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the tongue <i>is</i> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But the tongue can no man tame; <i>it is</i> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <i>water</i> and bitter?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so <i>can</i> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <i>is</i> earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For where envying and strife <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> confusion and every evil work.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <i>and</i> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
