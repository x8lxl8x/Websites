# Job 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Even to day <i>is</i> my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Oh that I knew where I might find him! <i>that</i> I might come <i>even</i> to his seat!</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I would order <i>my</i> cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I would know the words <i>which</i> he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Will he plead against me with <i>his</i> great power? No; but he would put <i>strength</i> in me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Behold, I go forward, but he <i>is</i> not <i>there</i>; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <i>him</i>: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <i>him</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But he knoweth the way that I take: <i>when</i> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <i>food</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But he <i>is</i> in one <i>mind</i>, and who can turn him? and <i>what</i> his soul desireth, even <i>that</i> he doeth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For he performeth <i>the thing that is</i> appointed for me: and many such <i>things are</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Because I was not cut off before the darkness, <i>neither</i> hath he covered the darkness from my face.</p>
