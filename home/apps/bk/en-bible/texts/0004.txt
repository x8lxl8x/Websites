# Genesis 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <i>shall be</i> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Cain, Where <i>is</i> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <i>Am</i> I my brother's keeper?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And now <i>art</i> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <i>is</i> greater than I can bear.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every one that findeth me shall slay me.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one <i>was</i> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <i>of such as have</i> cattle.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And his brother's name <i>was</i> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain <i>was</i> Naamah.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, <i>said she</i>, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
