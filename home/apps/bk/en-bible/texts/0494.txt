# Psalms 16

<p class="intro">Michtam of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>O my soul</i>, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou <i>art</i> my Lord: my goodness <i>extendeth</i> not to thee;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>But</i> to the saints that <i>are</i> in the earth, and <i>to</i> the excellent, in whom <i>is</i> all my delight.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Their sorrows shall be multiplied <i>that</i> hasten <i>after</i> another <i>god</i>: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <i>places</i>; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I have set the LORD always before me: because <i>he is</i> at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence <i>is</i> fulness of joy; at thy right hand <i>there are</i> pleasures for evermore.</p>
