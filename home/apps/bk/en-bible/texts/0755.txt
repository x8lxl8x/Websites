# Jeremiah 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the customs of the people <i>are</i> vain: for <i>one</i> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They <i>are</i> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <i>is it</i> in them to do good.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Forasmuch as <i>there is</i> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou <i>art</i> great, and thy name <i>is</i> great in might.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <i>men</i> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, <i>there is</i> none like unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <i>is</i> a doctrine of vanities.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple <i>is</i> their clothing: they <i>are</i> all the work of cunning <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the LORD <i>is</i> the true God, he <i>is</i> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, <i>even</i> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When he uttereth his voice, <i>there is</i> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Every man is brutish in <i>his</i> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image <i>is</i> falsehood, and <i>there is</i> no breath in them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; They <i>are</i> vanity, <i>and</i> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The portion of Jacob <i>is</i> not like them: for he <i>is</i> the former of all <i>things</i>; and Israel <i>is</i> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find <i>it so</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this <i>is</i> a grief, and I must bear it.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they <i>are</i> not: <i>there is</i> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <i>and</i> a den of dragons.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; O LORD, I know that the way of man <i>is</i> not in himself: <i>it is</i> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</p>
