# Psalms 69

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <i>my</i> soul.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I sink in deep mire, where <i>there is</i> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <i>being</i> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <i>that</i> which I took not away.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When I wept, <i>and chastened</i> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <i>was</i> the song of the drunkards.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But as for me, my prayer <i>is</i> unto thee, O LORD, <i>in</i> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Draw nigh unto my soul, <i>and</i> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <i>are</i> all before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <i>for some</i> to take pity, but <i>there was</i> none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Let their table become a snare before them: and <i>that which should have been</i> for <i>their</i> welfare, <i>let it become</i> a trap.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Let their habitation be desolate; <i>and</i> let none dwell in their tents.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For they persecute <i>him</i> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; <i>This</i> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <i>or</i> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The humble shall see <i>this, and</i> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>
