# II Corinthians 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For to <i>their</i> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <i>their</i> power <i>they were</i> willing of themselves;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <i>take upon us</i> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And <i>this they did</i>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore, as ye abound in every <i>thing, in</i> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <i>in</i> all diligence, and <i>in</i> your love to us, <i>see</i> that ye abound in this grace also.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And herein I give <i>my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Now therefore perform the doing <i>of it</i>; that as <i>there was</i> a readiness to will, so <i>there may be</i> a performance also out of that which ye have.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For if there be first a willing mind, <i>it is</i> accepted according to that a man hath, <i>and</i> not according to that he hath not.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For <i>I mean</i> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may be a supply</i> for their want, that their abundance also may be <i>a supply</i> for your want: that there may be equality:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; As it is written, He that <i>had gathered</i> much had nothing over; and he that <i>had gathered</i> little had no lack.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <i>is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And not <i>that</i> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <i>declaration of</i> your ready mind:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <i>I have</i> in you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Whether <i>any do enquire</i> of Titus, <i>he is</i> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <i>be enquired of, they are</i> the messengers of the churches, <i>and</i> the glory of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</p>
