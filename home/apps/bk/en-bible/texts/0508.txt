# Psalms 30

<p class="intro">A Psalm <i>and</i> Song <i>at</i> the dedication of the house of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For his anger <i>endureth but</i> a moment; in his favour <i>is</i> life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy <i>cometh</i> in the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <i>and</i> I was troubled.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; What profit <i>is there</i> in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; To the end that <i>my</i> glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</p>
