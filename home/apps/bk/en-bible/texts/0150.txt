<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth <i>even</i> unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; And ye shall dispossess <i>the inhabitants</i> of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: <i>and</i> to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's <i>inheritance</i> shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them <i>shall be</i> pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; Moreover it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.</p>
