# I Corinthians 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <i>even</i> as unto babes in Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <i>to bear it</i>, neither yet now are ye able.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i>there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <i>am</i> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who then is Paul, and who <i>is</i> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <i>ye are</i> God's building.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> ye are.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And ye are Christ's; and Christ <i>is</i> God's.</p>
