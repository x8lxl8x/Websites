# Psalms 119

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>are</i> the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Blessed <i>are</i> they that keep his testimonies, <i>and that</i> seek him with the whole heart.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou hast commanded <i>us</i> to keep thy precepts diligently.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed <i>thereto</i> according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as <i>much as</i> in all riches.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Deal bountifully with thy servant, <i>that</i> I may live, and keep thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I <i>am</i> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; My soul breaketh for the longing <i>that it hath</i> unto thy judgments at all times.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are</i> cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Princes also did sit <i>and</i> speak against me: <i>but</i> thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Thy testimonies also <i>are</i> my delight <i>and</i> my counsellors.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid <i>before me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it <i>unto</i> the end.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with <i>my</i> whole heart.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; <i>and</i> quicken thou me in thy way.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who <i>is devoted</i> to thy fear.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments <i>are</i> good.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, <i>even</i> thy salvation, according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; This <i>is</i> my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; The proud have had me greatly in derision: <i>yet</i> have I not declined from thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; <i>Thou art</i> my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; I intreated thy favour with <i>my</i> whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|60]&ensp; I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|61]&ensp; The bands of the wicked have robbed me: <i>but</i> I have not forgotten thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|62]&ensp; At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|63]&ensp; I <i>am</i> a companion of all <i>them</i> that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|64]&ensp; The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|65]&ensp; Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|66]&ensp; Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|67]&ensp; Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|68]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|69]&ensp; The proud have forged a lie against me: <i>but</i> I will keep thy precepts with <i>my</i> whole heart.</p>

<p>%[l|70]&ensp; Their heart is as fat as grease; <i>but</i> I delight in thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|71]&ensp; <i>It is</i> good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|72]&ensp; The law of thy mouth <i>is</i> better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>

<p>%[l|73]&ensp; Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|74]&ensp; They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|75]&ensp; I know, O LORD, that thy judgments <i>are</i> right, and <i>that</i> thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>

<p>%[l|76]&ensp; Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>

<p>%[l|77]&ensp; Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law <i>is</i> my delight.</p>

<p>%[l|78]&ensp; Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: <i>but</i> I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|79]&ensp; Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|80]&ensp; Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|81]&ensp; My soul fainteth for thy salvation: <i>but</i> I hope in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|82]&ensp; Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>

<p>%[l|83]&ensp; For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; <i>yet</i> do I not forget thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|84]&ensp; How many <i>are</i> the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>

<p>%[l|85]&ensp; The proud have digged pits for me, which <i>are</i> not after thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|86]&ensp; All thy commandments <i>are</i> faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>

<p>%[l|87]&ensp; They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|88]&ensp; Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|89]&ensp; For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|90]&ensp; Thy faithfulness <i>is</i> unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>

<p>%[l|91]&ensp; They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all <i>are</i> thy servants.</p>

<p>%[l|92]&ensp; Unless thy law <i>had been</i> my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>

<p>%[l|93]&ensp; I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>

<p>%[l|94]&ensp; I <i>am</i> thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|95]&ensp; The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: <i>but</i> I will consider thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|96]&ensp; I have seen an end of all perfection: <i>but</i> thy commandment <i>is</i> exceeding broad.</p>

<p>%[l|97]&ensp; O how love I thy law! it <i>is</i> my meditation all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|98]&ensp; Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they <i>are</i> ever with me.</p>

<p>%[l|99]&ensp; I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies <i>are</i> my meditation.</p>

<p>%[l|100]&ensp; I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|101]&ensp; I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|102]&ensp; I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>

<p>%[l|103]&ensp; How sweet are thy words unto my taste! <i>yea, sweeter</i> than honey to my mouth!</p>

<p>%[l|104]&ensp; Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>

<p>%[l|105]&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>

<p>%[l|106]&ensp; I have sworn, and I will perform <i>it</i>, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|107]&ensp; I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|108]&ensp; Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|109]&ensp; My soul <i>is</i> continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|110]&ensp; The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|111]&ensp; Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they <i>are</i> the rejoicing of my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|112]&ensp; I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, <i>even unto</i> the end.</p>

<p>%[l|113]&ensp; I hate <i>vain</i> thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>

<p>%[l|114]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|115]&ensp; Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>

<p>%[l|116]&ensp; Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>

<p>%[l|117]&ensp; Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>

<p>%[l|118]&ensp; Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit <i>is</i> falsehood.</p>

<p>%[l|119]&ensp; Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth <i>like</i> dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|120]&ensp; My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|121]&ensp; I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>

<p>%[l|122]&ensp; Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>

<p>%[l|123]&ensp; Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|124]&ensp; Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|125]&ensp; I <i>am</i> thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|126]&ensp; <i>It is</i> time for <i>thee</i>, LORD, to work: <i>for</i> they have made void thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|127]&ensp; Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>

<p>%[l|128]&ensp; Therefore I esteem all <i>thy</i> precepts <i>concerning</i> all <i>things to be</i> right; <i>and</i> I hate every false way.</p>

<p>%[l|129]&ensp; Thy testimonies <i>are</i> wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>

<p>%[l|130]&ensp; The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>

<p>%[l|131]&ensp; I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|132]&ensp; Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|133]&ensp; Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>

<p>%[l|134]&ensp; Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|135]&ensp; Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|136]&ensp; Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|137]&ensp; Righteous <i>art</i> thou, O LORD, and upright <i>are</i> thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|138]&ensp; Thy testimonies <i>that</i> thou hast commanded <i>are</i> righteous and very faithful.</p>

<p>%[l|139]&ensp; My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>

<p>%[l|140]&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>

<p>%[l|141]&ensp; I <i>am</i> small and despised: <i>yet</i> do not I forget thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|142]&ensp; Thy righteousness <i>is</i> an everlasting righteousness, and thy law <i>is</i> the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|143]&ensp; Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: <i>yet</i> thy commandments <i>are</i> my delights.</p>

<p>%[l|144]&ensp; The righteousness of thy testimonies <i>is</i> everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>

<p>%[l|145]&ensp; I cried with <i>my</i> whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|146]&ensp; I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|147]&ensp; I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|148]&ensp; Mine eyes prevent the <i>night</i> watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|149]&ensp; Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|150]&ensp; They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|151]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> near, O LORD; and all thy commandments <i>are</i> truth.</p>

<p>%[l|152]&ensp; Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|153]&ensp; Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>

<p>%[l|154]&ensp; Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|155]&ensp; Salvation <i>is</i> far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|156]&ensp; Great <i>are</i> thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|157]&ensp; Many <i>are</i> my persecutors and mine enemies; <i>yet</i> do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|158]&ensp; I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|159]&ensp; Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>

<p>%[l|160]&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> true <i>from</i> the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|161]&ensp; Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|162]&ensp; I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>

<p>%[l|163]&ensp; I hate and abhor lying: <i>but</i> thy law do I love.</p>

<p>%[l|164]&ensp; Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>

<p>%[l|165]&ensp; Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>

<p>%[l|166]&ensp; LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>

<p>%[l|167]&ensp; My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>

<p>%[l|168]&ensp; I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways <i>are</i> before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|169]&ensp; Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|170]&ensp; Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|171]&ensp; My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|172]&ensp; My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments <i>are</i> righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|173]&ensp; Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>

<p>%[l|174]&ensp; I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law <i>is</i> my delight.</p>

<p>%[l|175]&ensp; Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.</p>

<p>%[l|176]&ensp; I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>
