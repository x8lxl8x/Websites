# Psalms 28

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, <i>if</i> thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief <i>is</i> in their hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> their strength, and he <i>is</i> the saving strength of his anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</p>
