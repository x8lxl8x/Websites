# Psalms 49

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear this, all <i>ye</i> people; give ear, all <i>ye</i> inhabitants of the world:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart <i>shall be</i> of understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <i>when</i> the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; None <i>of them</i> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; (For the redemption of their soul <i>is</i> precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; That he should still live for ever, <i>and</i> not see corruption.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For he seeth <i>that</i> wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Their inward thought <i>is, that</i> their houses <i>shall continue</i> for ever, <i>and</i> their dwelling places to all generations; they call <i>their</i> lands after their own names.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Nevertheless man <i>being</i> in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts <i>that</i> perish.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; This their way <i>is</i> their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and <i>men</i> will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Man <i>that is</i> in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts <i>that</i> perish.</p>
