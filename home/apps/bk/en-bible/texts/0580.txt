# Psalms 102

<p class="intro">A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hide not thy face from me in the day <i>when</i> I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day <i>when</i> I call answer me speedily.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <i>and</i> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My days <i>are</i> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou shalt arise, <i>and</i> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <i>are</i> throughout all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens <i>are</i> the work of thy hands.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But thou <i>art</i> the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>
