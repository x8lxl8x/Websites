# I Timothy 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <i>which is</i> our hope;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Unto Timothy, <i>my</i> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <i>so do</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <i>of</i> a good conscience, and <i>of</i> faith unfeigned:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But we know that the law <i>is</i> good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <i>it</i> ignorantly in unbelief.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; This <i>is</i> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <i>be</i> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
