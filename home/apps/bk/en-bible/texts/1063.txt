# I Corinthians 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, called <i>to be</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <i>our</i> brother,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i>to be</i> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <i>in</i> all knowledge;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <i>that ye may be</i> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <i>which are of the house</i> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Where <i>is</i> the wise? where <i>is</i> the scribe? where <i>is</i> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <i>are called</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <i>yea</i>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; That no flesh should glory in his presence.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
