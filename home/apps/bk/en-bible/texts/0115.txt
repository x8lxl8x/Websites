# Leviticus 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: <i>for</i> it is a year of rest unto the land.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And for thy cattle, and for the beast that <i>are</i> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <i>day</i> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <i>all</i> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <i>the grapes</i> in it of thy vine undressed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For it <i>is</i> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest <i>ought</i> of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, <i>and</i> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for <i>according</i> to the number <i>of the years</i> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat <i>yet</i> of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat <i>of</i> the old <i>store</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land <i>is</i> mine; for ye <i>are</i> strangers and sojourners with me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away <i>some</i> of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But if he be not able to restore <i>it</i> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; <i>within</i> a full year may he redeem it.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that <i>is</i> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <i>and</i> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <i>the year of</i> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites <i>are</i> their possession among the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it <i>is</i> their perpetual possession.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: <i>yea, though he be</i> a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <i>and</i> to be your God.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And if thy brother <i>that dwelleth</i> by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; <i>But</i> as an hired servant, <i>and</i> as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, <i>and</i> shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And <i>then</i> shall he depart from thee, <i>both</i> he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; For they <i>are</i> my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, <i>shall be</i> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that <i>are</i> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit <i>them for</i> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother <i>that dwelleth</i> by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger <i>or</i> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or <i>any</i> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; If <i>there be</i> yet many years <i>behind</i>, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, <i>and</i> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; <i>And</i> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: <i>and the other</i> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; And if he be not redeemed in these <i>years</i>, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, <i>both</i> he, and his children with him.</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; For unto me the children of Israel <i>are</i> servants; they <i>are</i> my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>
