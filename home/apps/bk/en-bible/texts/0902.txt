# Nahum 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make <i>thy</i> loins strong, fortify <i>thy</i> power mightily.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men <i>are</i> in scarlet: the chariots <i>shall be</i> with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead <i>her</i> as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But Nineveh <i>is</i> of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, <i>shall they cry</i>; but none shall look back.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for <i>there is</i> none end of the store <i>and</i> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain <i>is</i> in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Where <i>is</i> the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, <i>even</i> the old lion, walked, <i>and</i> the lion's whelp, and none made <i>them</i> afraid?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p>
