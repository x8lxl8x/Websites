# Proverbs 20

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Wine <i>is</i> a mocker, strong drink <i>is</i> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The fear of a king <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion: <i>whoso</i> provoketh him to anger sinneth <i>against</i> his own soul.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>It is</i> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <i>therefore</i> shall he beg in harvest, and <i>have</i> nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Counsel in the heart of man <i>is like</i> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The just <i>man</i> walketh in his integrity: his children <i>are</i> blessed after him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures, both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <i>be</i> pure, and whether <i>it be</i> right.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <i>and</i> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>It is</i> naught, <i>it is</i> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <i>are</i> a precious jewel.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Take his garment that is surety <i>for</i> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Bread of deceit <i>is</i> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>Every</i> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He that goeth about <i>as</i> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; An inheritance <i>may be</i> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <i>but</i> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Divers weights <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <i>is</i> not good.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Man's goings <i>are</i> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; <i>It is</i> a snare to the man <i>who</i> devoureth <i>that which is</i> holy, and after vows to make enquiry.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The spirit of man <i>is</i> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The glory of young men <i>is</i> their strength: and the beauty of old men <i>is</i> the gray head.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <i>do</i> stripes the inward parts of the belly.</p>
