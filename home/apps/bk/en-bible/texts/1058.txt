# Romans 12

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> according to the proportion of faith;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Or ministry, <i>let us wait</i> on <i>our</i> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <i>let him do it</i> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Let</i> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Be</i> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>Be</i> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <i>rather</i> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <i>is</i> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
