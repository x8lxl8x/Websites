# Numbers 30

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD hath commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, <i>being</i> in her father's house in her youth;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And her husband heard <i>it,</i> and held his peace at her in the day that he heard <i>it</i>: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard <i>it</i>; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And her husband heard <i>it</i>, and held his peace at her, <i>and</i> disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard <i>them; then</i> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which <i>are</i> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard <i>them</i>; then he shall bear her iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, <i>being yet</i> in her youth in her father's house.</p>
