# I Kings 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Elijah the Tishbite, <i>who was</i> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, <i>As</i> the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that <i>is</i> before Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And it shall be, <i>that</i> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <i>is</i> before Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <i>belongeth</i> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <i>was</i> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And as she was going to fetch <i>it</i>, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And she said, <i>As</i> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <i>am</i> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <i>and</i> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <i>it</i> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <i>that</i> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <i>many</i> days.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>And</i> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass after these things, <i>that</i> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <i>art</i> a man of God, <i>and</i> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <i>is</i> truth.</p>
