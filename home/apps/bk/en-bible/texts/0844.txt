# Ezekiel 42

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <i>was</i> over against the separate place, and which <i>was</i> before the building toward the north.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Before the length of an hundred cubits <i>was</i> the north door, and the breadth <i>was</i> fifty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Over against the twenty <i>cubits</i> which <i>were</i> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <i>was</i> for the utter court, <i>was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i>stories</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And before the chambers <i>was</i> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Now the upper chambers <i>were</i> shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For they <i>were</i> in three <i>stories</i>, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore <i>the building</i> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the wall that <i>was</i> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the length of the chambers that <i>were</i> in the utter court <i>was</i> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <i>were</i> an hundred cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And from under these chambers <i>was</i> the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The chambers <i>were</i> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the way before them <i>was</i> like the appearance of the chambers which <i>were</i> toward the north, as long as they, <i>and</i> as broad as they: and all their goings out <i>were</i> both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And according to the doors of the chambers that <i>were</i> toward the south <i>was</i> a door in the head of the way, <i>even</i> the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then said he unto me, The north chambers <i>and</i> the south chambers, which <i>are</i> before the separate place, they <i>be</i> holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place <i>is</i> holy.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <i>place</i> into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <i>are</i> holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to <i>those things</i> which <i>are</i> for the people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the east, and measured it round about.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; He turned about to the west side, <i>and</i> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred <i>reeds</i> long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</p>
