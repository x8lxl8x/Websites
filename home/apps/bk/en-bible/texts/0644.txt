# Proverbs 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <i>is</i> from the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; All the ways of a man <i>are</i> clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Every one <i>that is</i> proud in heart <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: <i>though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; A divine sentence <i>is</i> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; A just weight and balance <i>are</i> the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag <i>are</i> his work.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>It is</i> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Righteous lips <i>are</i> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The wrath of a king <i>is as</i> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; In the light of the king's countenance <i>is</i> life; and his favour <i>is</i> as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; How much better <i>is it</i> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The highway of the upright <i>is</i> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Pride <i>goeth</i> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Better <i>it is to be</i> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Understanding <i>is</i> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Pleasant words <i>are as</i> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <i>there is</i> as a burning fire.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <i>that is</i> not good.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory, <i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>
