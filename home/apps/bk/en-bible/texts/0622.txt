# Psalms 144

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, <i>and</i> my fingers to fight:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and <i>he</i> in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; LORD, what <i>is</i> man, that thou takest knowledge of him! <i>or</i> the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Man is like to vanity: his days <i>are</i> as a shadow that passeth away.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <i>is</i> a right hand of falsehood.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery <i>and</i> an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>It is he</i> that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <i>is</i> a right hand of falsehood:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That our sons <i>may be</i> as plants grown up in their youth; <i>that</i> our daughters <i>may be</i> as corner stones, polished <i>after</i> the similitude of a palace:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; <i>That</i> our garners <i>may be</i> full, affording all manner of store: <i>that</i> our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; <i>That</i> our oxen <i>may be</i> strong to labour; <i>that there be</i> no breaking in, nor going out; that <i>there be</i> no complaining in our streets.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Happy <i>is that</i> people, that is in such a case: <i>yea</i>, happy <i>is that</i> people, whose God <i>is</i> the LORD.</p>
