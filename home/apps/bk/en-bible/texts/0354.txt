# I Chronicles 16

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then on that day David delivered first <i>this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He <i>is</i> the LORD our God; his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; <i>Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And <i>when</i> they went from nation to nation, and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For all the gods of the people <i>are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Glory and honour <i>are</i> in his presence; strength and gladness <i>are</i> in his place.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due</i> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <i>men</i> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <i>is</i> therein.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <i>and</i> glory in thy praise.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon,</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <i>to do</i> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever;</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <i>were</i> porters.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p>
