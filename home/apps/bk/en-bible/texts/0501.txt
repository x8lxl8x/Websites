# Psalms 23

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou <i>art</i> with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</p>
