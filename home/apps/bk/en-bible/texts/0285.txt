# II Samuel 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And David numbered the people that <i>were</i> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <i>thou art</i> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <i>it is</i> better that thou succour us out of the city.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <i>Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man, <i>even</i> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i>was</i> under him went away.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And a certain man saw <i>it</i>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <i>him</i>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in mine hand, <i>yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <i>was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <i>is</i> in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But howsoever, <i>said he</i>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <i>be</i> alone, <i>there is</i> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <i>another</i> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <i>is</i> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and <i>me</i> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <i>it was</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And the king said <i>unto him</i>, Turn aside, <i>and</i> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do <i>thee</i> hurt, be as <i>that</i> young man <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
