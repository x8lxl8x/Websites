# Job 36

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that <i>I have</i> yet to speak on God's behalf.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For truly my words <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> false: he that is perfect in knowledge <i>is</i> with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, God <i>is</i> mighty, and despiseth not <i>any: he is</i> mighty in strength <i>and</i> wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings <i>are they</i> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And if <i>they be</i> bound in fetters, <i>and</i> be holden in cords of affliction;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If they obey and serve <i>him</i>, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; They die in youth, and their life <i>is</i> among the unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <i>into</i> a broad place, where <i>there is</i> no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table <i>should be</i> full of fatness.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold <i>on thee</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Because <i>there is</i> wrath, <i>beware</i> lest he take thee away with <i>his</i> stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Will he esteem thy riches? <i>no</i>, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Every man may see it; man may behold <i>it</i> afar off.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Behold, God <i>is</i> great, and we know <i>him</i> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Which the clouds do drop <i>and</i> distil upon man abundantly.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Also can <i>any</i> understand the spreadings of the clouds, <i>or</i> the noise of his tabernacle?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it <i>not to shine</i> by <i>the cloud</i> that cometh betwixt.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>
