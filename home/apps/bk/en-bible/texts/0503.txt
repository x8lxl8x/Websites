# Psalms 25

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou <i>art</i> the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they <i>have been</i> ever of old.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Good and upright <i>is</i> the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All the paths of the LORD <i>are</i> mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it <i>is</i> great.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; What man <i>is</i> he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way <i>that</i> he shall choose.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The secret of the LORD <i>is</i> with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Mine eyes <i>are</i> ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I <i>am</i> desolate and afflicted.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; The troubles of my heart are enlarged: <i>O</i> bring thou me out of my distresses.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</p>
