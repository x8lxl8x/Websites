# Habakkuk 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <i>are</i> everlasting.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <i>and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <i>was</i> thine anger against the rivers? <i>was</i> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <i>and</i> thy chariots of salvation?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thy bow was made quite naked, <i>according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i>even thy</i> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The mountains saw thee, <i>and</i> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <i>and</i> lifted up his hands on high.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The sun <i>and</i> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <i>and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <i>even</i> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <i>through</i> the heap of great waters.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall</i> fruit <i>be</i> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i>there shall be</i> no herd in the stalls:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The LORD God <i>is</i> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</p>
