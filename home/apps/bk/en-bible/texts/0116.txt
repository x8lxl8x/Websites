# Leviticus 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up <i>any</i> image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make <i>you</i> afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, <i>but</i> that ye break my covenant:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your <i>high</i> ways shall be desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of <i>my</i> covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>And</i> when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver <i>you</i> your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye <i>be</i> in your enemies' land; <i>even</i> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And upon them that are left <i>alive</i> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And <i>that</i> I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</p>
