# Romans 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And not only <i>so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And not only <i>so</i>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But not as the offence, so also <i>is</i> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <i>which is</i> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And not as <i>it was</i> by one that sinned, <i>so is</i> the gift: for the judgment <i>was</i> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <i>is</i> of many offences unto justification.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Therefore as by the offence of one <i>judgment came</i> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <i>the free gift came</i> upon all men unto justification of life.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
