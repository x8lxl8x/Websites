# I Samuel 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <i>there was</i> no open vision.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <i>was</i> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <i>that</i> he could not see;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <i>was</i>, and Samuel was laid down <i>to sleep</i>;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; In that day I will perform against Eli all <i>things</i> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said, What <i>is</i> the thing that <i>the LORD</i> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <i>it</i> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <i>any</i> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <i>is</i> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i>was</i> established <i>to be</i> a prophet of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
