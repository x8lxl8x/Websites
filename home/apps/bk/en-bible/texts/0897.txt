# Micah 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But in the last days it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <i>is there</i> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <i>even</i> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
