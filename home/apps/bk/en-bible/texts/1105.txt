# Philippians 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; If <i>there be</i> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Let</i> nothing <i>be done</i> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <i>things</i> in heaven, and <i>things</i> in earth, and <i>things</i> under the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And <i>that</i> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <i>is</i> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his</i> good pleasure.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>
