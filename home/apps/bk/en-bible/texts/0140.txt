# Numbers 23

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on <i>every</i> altar a bullock and a ram.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon <i>every</i> altar a bullock and a ram.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, <i>saying</i>, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, <i>whom</i> the LORD hath not defied?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth <i>part</i> of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed <i>them</i> altogether.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet <i>the LORD</i> yonder.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; God <i>is</i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i>it</i>? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Behold, I have received <i>commandment</i> to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God <i>is</i> with him, and the shout of a king <i>is</i> among them.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Surely <i>there is</i> no enchantment against Jacob, neither <i>is there</i> any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat <i>of</i> the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.</p>
