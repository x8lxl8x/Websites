# Jeremiah 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <i>any</i> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O LORD, <i>are</i> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <i>but</i> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore I said, Surely these <i>are</i> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <i>nor</i> the judgment of their God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <i>and</i> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <i>and</i> burst the bonds.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <i>and</i> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, <i>and</i> their backslidings are increased.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <i>them that are</i> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They were <i>as</i> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Shall I not visit for these <i>things</i>? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <i>are</i> not the LORD'S.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They have belied the LORD, and said, <i>It is</i> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <i>is</i> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <i>is</i> a mighty nation, it <i>is</i> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Their quiver <i>is</i> as an open sepulchre, they <i>are</i> all mighty men.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <i>which</i> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <i>things</i> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land <i>that is</i> not yours.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand <i>for</i> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Your iniquities have turned away these <i>things</i>, and your sins have withholden good <i>things</i> from you.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For among my people are found wicked <i>men</i>: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; As a cage is full of birds, so <i>are</i> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Shall I not visit for these <i>things</i>? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love <i>to have it</i> so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?</p>
