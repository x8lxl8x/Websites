# Genesis 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the men of the place asked <i>him</i> of his wife; and he said, She <i>is</i> my sister: for he feared to say, <i>She is</i> my wife; lest, <i>said he</i>, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she <i>was</i> fair to look upon.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac <i>was</i> sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she <i>is</i> thy wife: and how saidst thou, She <i>is</i> my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Abimelech said, What <i>is</i> this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Abimelech charged all <i>his</i> people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water <i>is</i> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I <i>am</i> with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, <i>even</i> betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou <i>art</i> now the blessed of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city <i>is</i> Beersheba unto this day.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>
