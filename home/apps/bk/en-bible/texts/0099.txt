# Leviticus 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass on the eighth day, <i>that</i> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <i>them</i> before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <i>both</i> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they brought <i>that</i> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Moses said, This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which <i>was</i> for himself.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <i>them</i> upon the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <i>them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which <i>was</i> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt <i>it</i> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He slew also the bullock and the ram <i>for</i> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which <i>was</i> for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth <i>the inwards</i>, and the kidneys, and the caul <i>above</i> the liver:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <i>which</i> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
