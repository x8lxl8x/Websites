# Psalms 79

<p class="intro">A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <i>to be</i> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <i>there was</i> none to bury <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <i>is</i> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <i>by</i> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <i>which is</i> shed.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p>
