# Psalms 35

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Plead <i>my cause</i>, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way</i> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <i>am</i> thy salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For without cause have they hid for me their net <i>in</i> a pit, <i>which</i> without cause they have digged for my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All my bones shall say, LORD, who <i>is</i> like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <i>things</i> that I knew not.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They rewarded me evil for good <i>to</i> the spoiling of my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <i>was</i> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I behaved myself as though <i>he had been</i> my friend <i>or</i> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <i>for his</i> mother.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <i>yea</i>, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew <i>it</i> not; they did tear <i>me</i>, and ceased not:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: <i>neither</i> let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against <i>them that are</i> quiet in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, <i>and</i> said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>This</i> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <i>even</i> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness <i>and</i> of thy praise all the day long.</p>
