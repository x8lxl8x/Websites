# I Chronicles 18

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i>with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <i>were</i> chief about the king.</p>
