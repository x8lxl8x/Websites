# Genesis 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same <i>is</i> a great city.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, <i>and</i> in their nations.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were <i>children</i> born.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one <i>was</i> Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name <i>was</i> Joktan.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these <i>were</i> the sons of Joktan.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
