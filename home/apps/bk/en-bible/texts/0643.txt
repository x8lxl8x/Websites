# Proverbs 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; A wholesome tongue <i>is</i> a tree of life: but perverseness therein <i>is</i> a breach in the spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Correction <i>is</i> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: <i>and</i> he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Hell and destruction <i>are</i> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All the days of the afflicted <i>are</i> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <i>hath</i> a continual feast.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <i>he that is</i> slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The way of the slothful <i>man is</i> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <i>is</i> made plain.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Folly <i>is</i> joy to <i>him that is</i> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <i>spoken</i> in due season, how good <i>is it</i>!</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The way of life <i>is</i> above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The thoughts of the wicked <i>are</i> an abomination to the LORD: but <i>the words</i> of the pure <i>are</i> pleasant words.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <i>and</i> a good report maketh the bones fat.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>
