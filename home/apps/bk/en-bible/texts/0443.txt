# Job 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; <i>Is there</i> not an appointed time to man upon earth? <i>are not</i> his days also like the days of an hireling?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for <i>the reward of</i> his work:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; O remember that my life <i>is</i> wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no <i>more</i>: thine eyes <i>are</i> upon me, and I <i>am</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>As</i> the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no <i>more</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>Am</i> I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So that my soul chooseth strangling, <i>and</i> death rather than my life.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; I loathe <i>it</i>; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days <i>are</i> vanity.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; What <i>is</i> man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And <i>that</i> thou shouldest visit him every morning, <i>and</i> try him every moment?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>.</p>
