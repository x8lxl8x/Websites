# Hosea 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <i>and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And they consider not in their hearts <i>that</i> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They <i>are</i> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, <i>who</i> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; In the day of our king the princes have made <i>him</i> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: <i>there is</i> none among them that calleth unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <i>it</i> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <i>and</i> they rebel against me.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Though I have bound <i>and</i> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They return, <i>but</i> not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this <i>shall be</i> their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>
