# Psalms 96

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the LORD <i>is</i> great, and greatly to be praised: he <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For all the gods of the nations <i>are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Honour and majesty <i>are</i> before him: strength and beauty <i>are</i> in his sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due unto</i> his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Say among the heathen <i>that</i> the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let the field be joyful, and all that <i>is</i> therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>
