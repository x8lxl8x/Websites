# Proverbs 27

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A stone <i>is</i> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath <i>is</i> heavier than them both.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Wrath <i>is</i> cruel, and anger <i>is</i> outrageous; but who <i>is</i> able to stand before envy?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Open rebuke <i>is</i> better than secret love.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Faithful <i>are</i> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy <i>are</i> deceitful.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <i>is</i> a man that wandereth from his place.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <i>doth</i> the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: <i>for</i> better <i>is</i> a neighbour <i>that is</i> near than a brother far off.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, <i>and</i> hideth himself; <i>but</i> the simple pass on, <i>and</i> are punished.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <i>which</i> bewrayeth <i>itself</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; As in water face <i>answereth</i> to face, so the heart of man to man.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>As</i> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <i>is</i> a man to his praise.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <i>yet</i> will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <i>and</i> look well to thy herds.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For riches <i>are</i> not for ever: and doth the crown <i>endure</i> to every generation?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; The lambs <i>are</i> for thy clothing, and the goats <i>are</i> the price of the field.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And <i>thou shalt have</i> goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and <i>for</i> the maintenance for thy maidens.</p>
