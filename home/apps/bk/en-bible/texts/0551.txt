# Psalms 73

<p class="intro">A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Truly God <i>is</i> good to Israel, <i>even</i> to such as are of a clean heart.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For I was envious at the foolish, <i>when</i> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For <i>there are</i> no bands in their death: but their strength <i>is</i> firm.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They <i>are</i> not in trouble <i>as other</i> men; neither are they plagued like <i>other</i> men.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them <i>as</i> a garment.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; They are corrupt, and speak wickedly <i>concerning</i> oppression: they speak loftily.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <i>cup</i> are wrung out to them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Behold, these <i>are</i> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase <i>in</i> riches.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Verily I have cleansed my heart <i>in</i> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend <i>against</i> the generation of thy children.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; When I thought to know this, it <i>was</i> too painful for me;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <i>then</i> understood I their end.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; How are they <i>brought</i> into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; As a dream when <i>one</i> awaketh; <i>so</i>, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; So foolish <i>was</i> I, and ignorant: I was <i>as</i> a beast before thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Nevertheless I <i>am</i> continually with thee: thou hast holden <i>me</i> by my right hand.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me <i>to</i> glory.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Whom have I in heaven <i>but thee</i>? and <i>there is</i> none upon earth <i>that</i> I desire beside thee.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; My flesh and my heart faileth: <i>but</i> God <i>is</i> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; But <i>it is</i> good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>
