# Mark 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <i>these</i> things are done in parables:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <i>their</i> sins should be forgiven them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The sower soweth the word.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <i>it</i>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; <i>It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>
