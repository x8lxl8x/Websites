# Genesis 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <i>upon</i> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But flesh with the life thereof, <i>which is</i> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And with every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And God said, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I will remember my covenant, which <i>is</i> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And God said unto Noah, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham <i>is</i> the father of Canaan.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Noah began <i>to be</i> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid <i>it</i> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces <i>were</i> backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And he said, Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>
