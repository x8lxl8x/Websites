# Psalms 118

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good: because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let Israel now say, that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, <i>and set me</i> in a large place.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see <i>my desire</i> upon them that hate me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The voice of rejoicing and salvation <i>is</i> in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, <i>and</i> I will praise the LORD:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The stone <i>which</i> the builders refused is become the head <i>stone</i> of the corner.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; This is the LORD'S doing; it <i>is</i> marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the day <i>which</i> the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; God <i>is</i> the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, <i>even</i> unto the horns of the altar.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> my God, and I will praise thee: <i>thou art</i> my God, I will exalt thee.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
