# John 17

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received <i>them</i>, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <i>are</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <i>art</i> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <i>it</i>: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</p>
