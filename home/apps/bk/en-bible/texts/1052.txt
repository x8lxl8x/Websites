# Romans 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>his</i> resurrection:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <i>him</i>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Neither yield ye your members <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <i>is</i> death.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death; but the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
