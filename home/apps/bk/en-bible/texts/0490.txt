# Psalms 12

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <i>with</i> flattering lips <i>and</i> with a double heart do they speak.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, <i>and</i> the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips <i>are</i> our own: who <i>is</i> lord over us?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set <i>him</i> in safety <i>from him that</i> puffeth at him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The words of the LORD <i>are</i> pure words: <i>as</i> silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
