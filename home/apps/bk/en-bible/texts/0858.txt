# Daniel 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <i>even unto</i> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <i>was</i> at Shushan <i>in</i> the palace, which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <i>two</i> horns: and the <i>two</i> horns <i>were</i> high; but one <i>was</i> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <i>was there any</i> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <i>had</i> a notable horn between his eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he came to the ram that had <i>two</i> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i>land</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And it waxed great, <i>even</i> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <i>some</i> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Yea, he magnified <i>himself</i> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <i>sacrifice</i> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And an host was given <i>him</i> against the daily <i>sacrifice</i> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <i>saint</i> which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i> the daily <i>sacrifice</i>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it came to pass, when I, <i>even</i> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And I heard a man's voice between <i>the banks of</i> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <i>man</i> to understand the vision.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <i>shall be</i> the vision.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end <i>shall be</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The ram which thou sawest having <i>two</i> horns <i>are</i> the kings of Media and Persia.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the rough goat <i>is</i> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that <i>is</i> between his eyes <i>is</i> the first king.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <i>himself</i> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <i>is</i> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <i>shall be</i> for many days.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <i>certain</i> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <i>it</i>.</p>
