# Exodus 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <i>to wife</i> a daughter of Levi.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <i>was a</i> goodly <i>child</i>, she hid him three months.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <i>it</i> in the flags by the river's brink.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <i>herself</i> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when she had opened <i>it</i>, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <i>is one</i> of the Hebrews' children.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <i>thee</i> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <i>there was</i> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <i>water</i>, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <i>is it that</i> ye are come so soon to day?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <i>water</i> enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And he said unto his daughters, And where <i>is</i> he? why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And she bare <i>him</i> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <i>them</i>.</p>
