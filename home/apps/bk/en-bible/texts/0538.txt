# Psalms 60

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That thy beloved may be delivered; save <i>with</i> thy right hand, and hear me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Gilead <i>is</i> mine, and Manasseh <i>is</i> mine; Ephraim also <i>is</i> the strength of mine head; Judah <i>is</i> my lawgiver;</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Moab <i>is</i> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who will bring me <i>into</i> the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Wilt</i> not thou, O God, <i>which</i> hadst cast us off? and <i>thou</i>, O God, <i>which</i> didst not go out with our armies?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Give us help from trouble: for vain <i>is</i> the help of man.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <i>it is that</i> shall tread down our enemies.</p>
