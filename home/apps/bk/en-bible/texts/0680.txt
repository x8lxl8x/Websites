# Isaiah 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: <i>but</i> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; From the sole of the foot even unto the head <i>there is</i> no soundness in it; <i>but</i> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Your country <i>is</i> desolate, your cities <i>are</i> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <i>it is</i> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <i>and</i> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; To what purpose <i>is</i> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <i>it is</i> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Thy princes <i>are</i> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <i>shall be</i> together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <i>them</i>.</p>
