# Matthew 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And when he had called unto <i>him</i> his twelve disciples, he gave them power <i>against</i> unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James <i>the son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <i>any</i> city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Nor scrip for <i>your</i> journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when ye come into an house, salute it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against <i>their</i> parents, and cause them to be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And ye shall be hated of all <i>men</i> for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The disciple is not above <i>his</i> master, nor the servant above his lord.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <i>shall they call</i> them of his household?</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; What I tell you in darkness, <i>that</i> speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, <i>that</i> preach ye upon the housetops.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And a man's foes <i>shall be</i> they of his own household.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold <i>water</i> only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>
