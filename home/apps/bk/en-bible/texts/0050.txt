# Genesis 50

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This <i>is</i> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we <i>be</i> thy servants.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for <i>am</i> I in the place of God?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But as for you, ye thought evil against me; <i>but</i> God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as <i>it is</i> this day, to save much people alive.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third <i>generation</i>: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; So Joseph died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
