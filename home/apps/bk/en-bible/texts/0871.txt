# Hosea 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as <i>other</i> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <i>things</i> in Assyria.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They shall not offer wine <i>offerings</i> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant <i>places</i> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns <i>shall be</i> in their tabernacles.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <i>it</i>: the prophet <i>is</i> a fool, the spiritual man <i>is</i> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The watchman of Ephraim <i>was</i> with my God: <i>but</i> the prophet <i>is</i> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <i>and</i> hatred in the house of his God.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They have deeply corrupted <i>themselves</i>, as in the days of Gibeah: <i>therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: <i>but</i> they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto <i>that</i> shame; and <i>their</i> abominations were according as they loved.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>As for</i> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, <i>that there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a man <i>left</i>: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, <i>is</i> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; All their wickedness <i>is</i> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes <i>are</i> revolters.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay <i>even</i> the beloved <i>fruit</i> of their womb.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p>
