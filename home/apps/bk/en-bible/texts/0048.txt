# Genesis 48

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass after these things, that <i>one</i> told Joseph, Behold, thy father <i>is</i> sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And <i>one</i> told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee <i>for</i> an everlasting possession.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, <i>are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, <i>and</i> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet <i>there was</i> but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same <i>is</i> Bethlehem.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who <i>are</i> these?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Joseph said unto his father, They <i>are</i> my sons, whom God hath given me in this <i>place</i>. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, <i>so that</i> he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought <i>them</i> near unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid <i>it</i> upon Ephraim's head, who <i>was</i> the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh <i>was</i> the firstborn.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this <i>is</i> the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And his father refused, and said, I know <i>it</i>, my son, I know <i>it</i>: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>
