# Matthew 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; When Jesus understood <i>it</i>, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i>there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And said <i>unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he answered and said, He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|53]&ensp; Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>

<p>%[l|54]&ensp; But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>

<p>%[l|55]&ensp; In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>

<p>%[l|56]&ensp; But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>

<p>%[l|57]&ensp; And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i>him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>

<p>%[l|58]&ensp; But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>

<p>%[l|59]&ensp; Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>

<p>%[l|60]&ensp; But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>

<p>%[l|61]&ensp; And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>

<p>%[l|62]&ensp; And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?</p>

<p>%[l|63]&ensp; But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>

<p>%[l|64]&ensp; Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|65]&ensp; Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>

<p>%[l|66]&ensp; What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>

<p>%[l|67]&ensp; Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,</p>

<p>%[l|68]&ensp; Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>

<p>%[l|69]&ensp; Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>

<p>%[l|70]&ensp; But he denied before <i>them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>

<p>%[l|71]&ensp; And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>%[l|72]&ensp; And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>

<p>%[l|73]&ensp; And after a while came unto <i>him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i>one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>

<p>%[l|74]&ensp; Then began he to curse and to swear, <i>saying</i>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>

<p>%[l|75]&ensp; And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
