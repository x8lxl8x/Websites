# Numbers 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And those men said unto him, We <i>are</i> defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or <i>be</i> in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, <i>and</i> eat it with unleavened bread and bitter <i>herbs</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But the man that <i>is</i> clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, <i>namely</i>, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; So it was alway: the cloud covered it <i>by day</i>, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And <i>so</i> it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And <i>so</i> it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and <i>that</i> the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether <i>it was</i> by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Or <i>whether it were</i> two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
