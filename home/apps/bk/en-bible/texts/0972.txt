# Mark 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried <i>him</i> away, and delivered <i>him</i> to Pilate.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Now at <i>that</i> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And there was <i>one</i> named Barabbas, <i>which lay</i> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <i>him to do</i> as he had ever done unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <i>unto him</i> whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And <i>so</i> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i>him</i>, to be crucified.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <i>head</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <i>their</i> knees worshipped him.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <i>it</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And some of them that stood by, when they heard <i>it</i>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <i>unto him</i> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And when he knew <i>it</i> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; And Mary Magdalene and Mary <i>the mother</i> of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
