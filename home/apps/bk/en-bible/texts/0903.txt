# Nahum 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe to the bloody city! it <i>is</i> all full of lies <i>and</i> robbery; the prey departeth not;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and <i>there is</i> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and <i>there is</i> none end of <i>their</i> corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, <i>that had</i> the waters round about it, whose rampart <i>was</i> the sea, <i>and</i> her wall <i>was</i> from the sea?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Ethiopia and Egypt <i>were</i> her strength, and <i>it was</i> infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Yet <i>was</i> she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; All thy strong holds <i>shall be like</i> fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <i>are</i> women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Thy crowned <i>are</i> as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, <i>but</i> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they <i>are</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell <i>in the dust</i>: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</p>
