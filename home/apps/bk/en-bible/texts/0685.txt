# Isaiah 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <i>is</i> full of his glory.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then said I, Woe <i>is</i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am</i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <i>which</i> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he laid <i>it</i> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <i>am</i> I; send me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the LORD have removed men far away, and <i>there be</i> a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But yet in it <i>shall be</i> a tenth, and <i>it</i> shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance <i>is</i> in them, when they cast <i>their leaves: so</i> the holy seed <i>shall be</i> the substance thereof.</p>
