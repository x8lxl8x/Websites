# Psalms 123

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Behold, as the eyes of servants <i>look</i> unto the hand of their masters, <i>and</i> as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes <i>wait</i> upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, <i>and</i> with the contempt of the proud.</p>
