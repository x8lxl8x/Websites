# Psalms 38

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <i>is there any</i> rest in my bones because of my sin.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My wounds stink <i>and</i> are corrupt because of my foolishness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For my loins are filled with a loathsome <i>disease</i>: and <i>there is</i> no soundness in my flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Lord, all my desire <i>is</i> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; They also that seek after my life lay snares <i>for me</i>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But I, as a deaf <i>man</i>, heard not; and <i>I was</i> as a dumb man <i>that</i> openeth not his mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <i>are</i> no reproofs.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For I said, <i>Hear me</i>, lest <i>otherwise</i> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> ready to halt, and my sorrow <i>is</i> continually before me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But mine enemies <i>are</i> lively, <i>and</i> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <i>the thing that</i> good <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>
