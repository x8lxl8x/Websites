# Psalms 34

<p class="intro"><i>A Psalm</i> of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise <i>shall</i> continually <i>be</i> in my mouth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear <i>thereof</i>, and be glad.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; This poor man cried, and the LORD heard <i>him</i>, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O taste and see that the LORD <i>is</i> good: blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> trusteth in him.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for <i>there is</i> no want to them that fear him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good <i>thing</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; What man <i>is he that</i> desireth life, <i>and</i> loveth <i>many</i> days, that he may see good?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> upon the righteous, and his ears <i>are open</i> unto their cry.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The face of the LORD <i>is</i> against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; <i>The righteous</i> cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Many <i>are</i> the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.</p>
