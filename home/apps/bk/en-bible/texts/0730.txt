# Isaiah 51

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock <i>whence</i> ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit <i>whence</i> ye are digged.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah <i>that</i> bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My righteousness <i>is</i> near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart <i>is</i> my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. <i>Art</i> thou not it that hath cut Rahab, <i>and</i> wounded the dragon?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>Art</i> thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy <i>shall be</i> upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; <i>and</i> sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I, <i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he that comforteth you: who <i>art</i> thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man <i>that</i> shall die, and of the son of man <i>which</i> shall be made <i>as</i> grass;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where <i>is</i> the fury of the oppressor?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou <i>art</i> my people.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, <i>and</i> wrung <i>them</i> out.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>There is</i> none to guide her among all the sons <i>whom</i> she hath brought forth; neither <i>is there any</i> that taketh her by the hand of all the sons <i>that</i> she hath brought up.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; These two <i>things</i> are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God <i>that</i> pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, <i>even</i> the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</p>
