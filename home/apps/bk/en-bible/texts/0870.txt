# Hosea 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; <i>Set</i> the trumpet to thy mouth. <i>He shall come</i> as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Israel hath cast off <i>the thing that is</i> good: the enemy shall pursue him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <i>it</i> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <i>thee</i> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <i>will it be</i> ere they attain to innocency?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For from Israel <i>was</i> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <i>is</i> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I have written to him the great things of my law, <i>but</i> they were counted as a strange thing.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; They sacrifice flesh <i>for</i> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat <i>it; but</i> the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
