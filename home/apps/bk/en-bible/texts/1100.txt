# Ephesians 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And to make all <i>men</i> see what <i>is</i> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <i>places</i> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; May be able to comprehend with all saints what <i>is</i> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Unto him <i>be</i> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p>
