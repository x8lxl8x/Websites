# Psalms 44

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, <i>what</i> work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>How</i> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; <i>how</i> thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Thou hast given us like sheep <i>appointed</i> for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase <i>thy wealth</i> by their price.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My confusion <i>is</i> continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast <i>us</i> not off for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wherefore hidest thou thy face, <i>and</i> forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</p>
