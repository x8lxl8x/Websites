# Exodus 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague <i>more</i> upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let <i>you</i> go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses <i>was</i> very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that <i>is</i> behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>
