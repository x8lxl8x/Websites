# Leviticus 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <i>are</i> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <i>are</i> on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <i>and</i> cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <i>as</i> the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <i>is</i> unclean to you.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <i>are</i> unclean to you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; These shall ye eat of all that <i>are</i> in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which <i>is</i> in the waters, they <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And these <i>are they which</i> ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they <i>are</i> an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Every raven after his kind;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; All fowls that creep, going upon <i>all</i> four, <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon <i>all</i> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; <i>Even</i> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But all <i>other</i> flying creeping things, which have four feet, <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And whosoever beareth <i>ought</i> of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>The carcases</i> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and <i>is</i> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <i>are</i> unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on <i>all</i> four, those <i>are</i> unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <i>are</i> unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; These also <i>shall be</i> unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; These <i>are</i> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And upon whatsoever <i>any</i> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <i>it be</i> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <i>it be</i>, wherein <i>any</i> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And every earthen vessel, whereinto <i>any</i> of them falleth, whatsoever <i>is</i> in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Of all meat which may be eaten, <i>that</i> on which <i>such</i> water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <i>such</i> vessel shall be unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And every <i>thing</i> whereupon <i>any part</i> of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; <i>whether it be</i> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: <i>for</i> they <i>are</i> unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <i>wherein there is</i> plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And if <i>any part</i> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it <i>shall be</i> clean.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But if <i>any</i> water be put upon the seed, and <i>any part</i> of their carcase fall thereon, it <i>shall be</i> unclean unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth <i>shall be</i> an abomination; it shall not be eaten.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon <i>all</i> four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they <i>are</i> an abomination.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <i>am</i> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; For I <i>am</i> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <i>am</i> holy.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; This <i>is</i> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</p>
