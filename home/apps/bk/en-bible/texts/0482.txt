# Psalms 4

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <i>when I was</i> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; O ye sons of men, how long <i>will ye turn</i> my glory into shame? <i>how long</i> will ye love vanity, <i>and</i> seek after leasing? Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>There be</i> many that say, Who will shew us <i>any</i> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <i>that</i> their corn and their wine increased.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
