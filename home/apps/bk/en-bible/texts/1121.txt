# I Timothy 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For kings, and <i>for</i> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For this <i>is</i> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For <i>there is</i> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <i>and</i> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p>
