# Psalms 64

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Who whet their tongue like a sword, <i>and</i> bend <i>their bows to shoot</i> their arrows, <i>even</i> bitter words:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; They encourage themselves <i>in</i> an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward <i>thought</i> of every one <i>of them</i>, and the heart, <i>is</i> deep.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But God shall shoot at them <i>with</i> an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
