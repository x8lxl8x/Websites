# Song of Solomon 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I am come into my garden, my sister, <i>my</i> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; I sleep, but my heart waketh: <i>it is</i> the voice of my beloved that knocketh, <i>saying</i>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, <i>and</i> my locks with the drops of the night.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My beloved put in his hand by the hole <i>of the door</i>, and my bowels were moved for him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped <i>with</i> myrrh, and my fingers <i>with</i> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, <i>and</i> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I <i>am</i> sick of love.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; What <i>is</i> thy beloved more than <i>another</i> beloved, O thou fairest among women? what <i>is</i> thy beloved more than <i>another</i> beloved, that thou dost so charge us?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; My beloved <i>is</i> white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; His head <i>is as</i> the most fine gold, his locks <i>are</i> bushy, <i>and</i> black as a raven.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; His eyes <i>are</i> as <i>the eyes</i> of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, <i>and</i> fitly set.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; His cheeks <i>are</i> as a bed of spices, <i>as</i> sweet flowers: his lips <i>like</i> lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; His hands <i>are as</i> gold rings set with the beryl: his belly <i>is as</i> bright ivory overlaid <i>with</i> sapphires.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; His legs <i>are as</i> pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance <i>is</i> as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; His mouth <i>is</i> most sweet: yea, he <i>is</i> altogether lovely. This <i>is</i> my beloved, and this <i>is</i> my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
