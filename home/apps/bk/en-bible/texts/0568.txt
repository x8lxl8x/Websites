# Psalms 90

<p class="intro">A Prayer of Moses the man of God.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou <i>art</i> God.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For a thousand years in thy sight <i>are but</i> as yesterday when it is past, and <i>as</i> a watch in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <i>as</i> a sleep: in the morning <i>they are</i> like grass <i>which</i> groweth up.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret <i>sins</i> in the light of thy countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale <i>that is told</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; The days of our years <i>are</i> threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength <i>they be</i> fourscore years, yet <i>is</i> their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, <i>so is</i> thy wrath.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; So teach <i>us</i> to number our days, that we may apply <i>our</i> hearts unto wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Make us glad according to the days <i>wherein</i> thou hast afflicted us, <i>and</i> the years <i>wherein</i> we have seen evil.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>
