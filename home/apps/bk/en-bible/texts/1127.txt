# II Timothy 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him</i>, we shall also live with <i>him</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him</i>: if we deny <i>him</i>, he also will deny us:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Of these things put <i>them</i> in remembrance, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i>but</i> to the subverting of the hearers.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; But shun profane <i>and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach, patient,</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And <i>that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
