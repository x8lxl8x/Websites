# Jonah 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him</i> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is</i> in their hands.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.</p>
