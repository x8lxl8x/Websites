# Leviticus 20

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <i>he be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <i>any</i> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <i>am</i> the LORD which sanctify you.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood <i>shall be</i> upon him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the man that committeth adultery with <i>another</i> man's wife, <i>even he</i> that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And if a man take a wife and her mother, it <i>is</i> wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it <i>is</i> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it <i>is</i> an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God, which have separated you from <i>other</i> people.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD <i>am</i> holy, and have severed you from <i>other</i> people, that ye should be mine.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.</p>
