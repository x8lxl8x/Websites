# Genesis 38

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name <i>was</i> Hirah.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name <i>was</i> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <i>did</i>. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <i>is</i> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; When Judah saw her, he thought her <i>to be</i> an harlot; because she had covered her face.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <i>was</i> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And he said, I will send <i>thee</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <i>me</i> a pledge, till thou send <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that <i>is</i> in thine hand. And he gave <i>it</i> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <i>his</i> pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <i>is</i> the harlot, that <i>was</i> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, <i>that</i> there was no harlot in this <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Judah said, Let her take <i>it</i> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <i>is</i> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; When she <i>was</i> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <i>are, am</i> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <i>are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And Judah acknowledged <i>them</i>, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And it came to pass, when she travailed, that <i>the one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <i>this</i> breach <i>be</i> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>
