# I Corinthians 13

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <i>as</i> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor</i>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Charity suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be</i> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <i>there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there be</i> knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> charity.</p>
