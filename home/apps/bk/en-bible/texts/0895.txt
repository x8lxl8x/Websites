# Micah 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And they covet fields, and take <i>them</i> by violence; and houses, and take <i>them</i> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <i>is</i> evil.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i>and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Prophesy ye not, <i>say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; O <i>thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Arise ye, and depart; for this <i>is</i> not <i>your</i> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <i>you</i>, even with a sore destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <i>saying</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the multitude of</i> men.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</p>
