# Deuteronomy 33

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And this <i>is</i> the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand <i>went</i> a fiery law for them.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <i>every one</i> shall receive of thy words.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Moses commanded us a law, <i>even</i> the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people <i>and</i> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <i>not</i> his men be few.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And this <i>is the blessing</i> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help <i>to him</i> from his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And of Levi he said, <i>Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i>be</i> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <i>and with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>And</i> of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; <i>and the LORD</i> shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD <i>be</i> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And for the precious fruits <i>brought forth</i> by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and <i>for</i> the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let <i>the blessing</i> come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him <i>that was</i> separated from his brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; His glory <i>is like</i> the firstling of his bullock, and his horns <i>are like</i> the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they <i>are</i> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they <i>are</i> the thousands of Manasseh.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck <i>of</i> the abundance of the seas, and <i>of</i> treasures hid in the sand.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And of Gad he said, Blessed <i>be</i> he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And he provided the first part for himself, because there, <i>in</i> a portion of the lawgiver, <i>was he</i> seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And of Dan he said, Dan <i>is</i> a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And of Asher he said, <i>Let</i> Asher <i>be</i> blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Thy shoes <i>shall be</i> iron and brass; and as thy days, <i>so shall</i> thy strength <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; <i>There is</i> none like unto the God of Jeshurun, <i>who</i> rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The eternal God <i>is thy</i> refuge, and underneath <i>are</i> the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob <i>shall be</i> upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Happy <i>art</i> thou, O Israel: who <i>is</i> like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who <i>is</i> the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</p>
