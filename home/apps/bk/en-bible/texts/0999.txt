# John 2

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i>but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <i>day</i>, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i>men</i>,</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
