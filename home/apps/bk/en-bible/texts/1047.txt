<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <i>to be</i> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And declared <i>to be</i> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>
