# Amos 6

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe to them <i>that are</i> at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, <i>which are</i> named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: <i>be they</i> better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; That chant to the sound of the viol, <i>and</i> invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that <i>is</i> by the sides of the house, <i>Is there</i> yet <i>any</i> with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Shall horses run upon the rock? will <i>one</i> plow <i>there</i> with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</p>
