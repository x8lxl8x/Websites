# Zechariah 7

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, <i>even</i> in Chisleu;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>And</i> to speak unto the priests which <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <i>month</i>, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <i>even</i> to me?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <i>for yourselves</i>, and drink <i>for yourselves</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; <i>Should ye</i> not <i>hear</i> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <i>men</i> inhabited the south and the plain?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, they made their hearts <i>as</i> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore it is come to pass, <i>that</i> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p>
