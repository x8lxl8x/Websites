# Psalms 88

<p class="intro">A Song <i>or</i> Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day <i>and</i> night before thee:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man <i>that hath</i> no strength:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <i>me</i> with all thy waves. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: <i>I am</i> shut up, and I cannot come forth.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise <i>and</i> praise thee? Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <i>or</i> thy faithfulness in destruction?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <i>why</i> hidest thou thy face from me?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I <i>am</i> afflicted and ready to die from <i>my</i> youth up: <i>while</i> I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, <i>and</i> mine acquaintance into darkness.</p>
