# Psalms 41

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; <i>and</i> he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And if he come to see <i>me</i>, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; <i>when</i> he goeth abroad, he telleth <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; An evil disease, <i>say they</i>, cleaveth fast unto him: and <i>now</i> that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up <i>his</i> heel against me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.</p>
