# Proverbs 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness; <i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i>am</i> understanding; I have strength.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; By me princes rule, and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <i>yea</i>, durable riches and righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; When he prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up <i>with him</i>: and I was daily <i>his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i>are they that</i> keep my ways.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>
