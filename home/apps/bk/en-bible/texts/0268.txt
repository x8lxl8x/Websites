# II Samuel 1

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <i>so</i> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he said unto me, Who <i>art</i> thou? And I answered him, I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <i>is</i> yet whole in me.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that <i>was</i> upon his head, and the bracelet that <i>was</i> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that <i>were</i> with him:</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence <i>art</i> thou? And he answered, I <i>am</i> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, <i>and</i> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And David said unto him, Thy blood <i>be</i> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <i>the use of</i> the bow: behold, <i>it is</i> written in the book of Jasher.)</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Tell <i>it</i> not in Gath, publish <i>it</i> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Ye mountains of Gilboa, <i>let there be</i> no dew, neither <i>let there be</i> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <i>as though he had</i> not <i>been</i> anointed with oil.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Saul and Jonathan <i>were</i> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <i>other</i> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, <i>thou wast</i> slain in thine high places.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>
