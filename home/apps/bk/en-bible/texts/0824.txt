# Ezekiel 22

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come <i>even</i> unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>Those that be</i> near, and <i>those that be</i> far from thee, shall mock thee, <i>which art</i> infamous <i>and</i> much vexed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>, and will do <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they <i>are</i> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are <i>even</i> the dross of silver.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>As</i> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt <i>it</i>; so will I gather <i>you</i> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave <i>you there</i>, and melt you.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Son of man, say unto her, Thou <i>art</i> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed <i>difference</i> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Her princes in the midst thereof <i>are</i> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <i>and</i> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <i>morter</i>, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
