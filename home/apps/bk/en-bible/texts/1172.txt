# Revelation 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <i>be</i> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</p>
