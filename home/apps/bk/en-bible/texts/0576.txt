# Psalms 98

<p class="intro">A Psalm.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Let the floods clap <i>their</i> hands: let the hills be joyful together</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.</p>
