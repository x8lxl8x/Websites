# Psalms 43

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, <i>who is</i> the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
