# I Chronicles 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <i>of it</i>, and went out against them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>
