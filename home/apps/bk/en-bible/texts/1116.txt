# I Thessalonians 5

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore let us not sleep, as <i>do</i> others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. <i>And</i> be at peace among yourselves.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; See that none render evil for evil unto any <i>man</i>; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Rejoice evermore.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Pray without ceasing.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Quench not the Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Despise not prophesyings.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <i>I pray God</i> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Faithful <i>is</i> he that calleth you, who also will do <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Brethren, pray for us.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</p>
