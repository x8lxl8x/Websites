# Hosea 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of <i>her</i> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; So I bought her to me for fifteen <i>pieces</i> of silver, and <i>for</i> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <i>another</i> man: so <i>will</i> I also <i>be</i> for thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <i>without</i> teraphim:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</p>
