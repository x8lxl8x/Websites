# Psalms 128

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i>, and <i>it shall be</i> well with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thy wife <i>shall be</i> as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, <i>and</i> peace upon Israel.</p>
