# Micah 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <i>Is it</i> not for you to know judgment?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Therefore night <i>shall be</i> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <i>there is</i> no answer of God.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, <i>Is</i> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <i>as</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</p>
