# Psalms 139

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted <i>with</i> all my ways.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For <i>there is</i> not a word in my tongue, <i>but</i>, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>Such</i> knowledge <i>is</i> too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot <i>attain</i> unto it.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; If I ascend up into heaven, thou <i>art</i> there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou <i>art there</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>If</i> I take the wings of the morning, <i>and</i> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light <i>are</i> both alike <i>to thee</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I will praise thee; for I am fearfully <i>and</i> wonderfully made: marvellous <i>are</i> thy works; and <i>that</i> my soul knoweth right well.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, <i>and</i> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all <i>my members</i> were written, <i>which</i> in continuance were fashioned, when <i>as yet there was</i> none of them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; <i>If</i> I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For they speak against thee wickedly, <i>and</i> thine enemies take <i>thy name</i> in vain.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And see if <i>there be any</i> wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
