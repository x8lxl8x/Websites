# John 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Then there arose a question between <i>some</i> of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <i>men</i> come to him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i>unto him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
