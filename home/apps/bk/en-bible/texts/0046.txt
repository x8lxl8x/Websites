# Genesis 46

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he said, I <i>am</i> God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up <i>again</i>: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; These <i>be</i> the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> thirty and three.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, <i>even</i> sixteen souls.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the sons of Benjamin <i>were</i> Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls <i>were</i> fourteen.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the sons of Dan; Hushim.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; These <i>are</i> the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls <i>were</i> seven.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls <i>were</i> threescore and six;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, <i>were</i> two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, <i>were</i> threescore and ten.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou <i>art</i> yet alive.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which <i>were</i> in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And the men <i>are</i> shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What <i>is</i> your occupation?</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, <i>and</i> also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
