# Proverbs 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; These <i>are</i> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; <i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; A word fitly spoken <i>is like</i> apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; <i>As</i> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <i>so is</i> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <i>so is</i> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> clouds and wind without rain.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and <i>so</i> hate thee.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <i>is</i> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <i>is like</i> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; <i>As</i> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <i>and as</i> vinegar upon nitre, so <i>is</i> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The north wind driveth away rain: so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; <i>As</i> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <i>is</i> good news from a far country.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; <i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He that <i>hath</i> no rule over his own spirit <i>is like</i> a city <i>that is</i> broken down, <i>and</i> without walls.</p>
