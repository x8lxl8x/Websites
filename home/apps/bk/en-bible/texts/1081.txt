# II Corinthians 3

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <i>others</i>, epistles of commendation to you, or <i>letters</i> of commendation from you?</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; <i>Forasmuch as ye are</i> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <i>is</i> of God;</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But if the ministration of death, written <i>and</i> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <i>glory</i> was to be done away:</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For if the ministration of condemnation <i>be</i> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; For if that which is done away <i>was</i> glorious, much more that which remaineth <i>is</i> glorious.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And not as Moses, <i>which</i> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <i>vail</i> is done away in Christ.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> liberty.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
