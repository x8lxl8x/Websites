# Psalms 131

<p class="intro">A Song of degrees of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul <i>is</i> even as a weaned child.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.</p>
