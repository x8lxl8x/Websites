# Isaiah 42

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, <i>in whom</i> my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, <i>and</i> them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD: that <i>is</i> my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Sing unto the LORD a new song, <i>and</i> his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <i>their voice</i>, the villages <i>that</i> Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, <i>and</i> refrained myself: <i>now</i> will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And I will bring the blind by a way <i>that</i> they knew not; I will lead them in paths <i>that</i> they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye <i>are</i> our gods.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger <i>that</i> I sent? who <i>is</i> blind as <i>he that is</i> perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make <i>it</i> honourable.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; But this <i>is</i> a people robbed and spoiled; <i>they are</i> all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Who among you will give ear to this? <i>who</i> will hearken and hear for the time to come?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid <i>it</i> not to heart.</p>
