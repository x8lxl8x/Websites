# Numbers 28

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, <i>and</i> my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, <i>for</i> a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And thou shalt say unto them, This <i>is</i> the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, <i>for</i> a continual burnt offering.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And a tenth <i>part</i> of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin of beaten oil.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; <i>It is</i> a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And the drink offering thereof <i>shall be</i> the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy <i>place</i> shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD <i>for</i> a drink offering.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer <i>it</i>, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; <i>This is</i> the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And three tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil <i>for</i> a meat offering unto one lamb; <i>for</i> a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third <i>part</i> of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth <i>part</i> of an hin unto a lamb: this <i>is</i> the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And in the fourteenth day of the first month <i>is</i> the passover of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And in the fifteenth day of this month <i>is</i> the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; In the first day <i>shall be</i> an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work <i>therein</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And their meat offering <i>shall be of</i> flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And one goat <i>for</i> a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which <i>is</i> for a continual burnt offering.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks <i>be out</i>, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; <i>And</i> one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Ye shall offer <i>them</i> beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.</p>
