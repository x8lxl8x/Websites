# Isaiah 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness <i>which</i> they have prescribed;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and <i>that</i> they may rob the fatherless!</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation <i>which</i> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but <i>it is</i> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For he saith, <i>Are</i> not my princes altogether kings?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>Is</i> not Calno as Carchemish? <i>is</i> not Hamath as Arpad? <i>is</i> not Samaria as Damascus?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wherefore it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done <i>it</i>, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant <i>man</i>:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs <i>that are</i> left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? <i>or</i> shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake <i>itself</i> against them that lift it up, <i>or</i> as if the staff should lift up <i>itself, as if it were</i> no wood.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The remnant shall return, <i>even</i> the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, <i>yet</i> a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and <i>as</i> his rod <i>was</i> upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand <i>against</i> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature <i>shall be</i> hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</p>
