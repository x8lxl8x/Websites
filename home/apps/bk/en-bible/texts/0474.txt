# Job 38

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Who <i>is</i> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Or <i>who</i> shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <i>as if</i> it had issued out of the womb?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And brake up for it my decreed <i>place</i>, and set bars and doors,</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; <i>and</i> caused the dayspring to know his place;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; It is turned as clay <i>to</i> the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Where <i>is</i> the way <i>where</i> light dwelleth? and <i>as for</i> darkness, where <i>is</i> the place thereof,</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths <i>to</i> the house thereof?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Knowest thou <i>it</i>, because thou wast then born? or <i>because</i> the number of thy days <i>is</i> great?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; By what way is the light parted, <i>which</i> scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; To cause it to rain on the earth, <i>where</i> no man <i>is; on</i> the wilderness, wherein <i>there is</i> no man;</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; To satisfy the desolate and waste <i>ground</i>; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The waters are hid as <i>with</i> a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we <i>are</i>?</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; When they couch in <i>their</i> dens, <i>and</i> abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</p>
