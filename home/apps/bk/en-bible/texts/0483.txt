# Psalms 5

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct <i>my prayer</i> unto thee, and will look up.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; But as for me, I will come <i>into</i> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <i>and</i> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; For <i>there is</i> no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part <i>is</i> very wickedness; their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as <i>with</i> a shield.</p>
