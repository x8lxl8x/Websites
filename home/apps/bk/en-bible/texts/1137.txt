# Hebrews 4

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <i>us</i> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And in this <i>place</i> again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i>did</i> from his.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For the word of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things <i>are</i> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
