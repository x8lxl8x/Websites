# Psalms 89

<p class="intro">Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? <i>who</i> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all <i>them that are</i> about him.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; O LORD God of hosts, who <i>is</i> a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The heavens <i>are</i> thine, the earth also <i>is</i> thine: <i>as for</i> the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, <i>and</i> high is thy right hand.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Justice and judgment <i>are</i> the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; For the LORD <i>is</i> our defence; and the Holy One of Israel <i>is</i> our king.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon <i>one that is</i> mighty; I have exalted <i>one</i> chosen out of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But my faithfulness and my mercy <i>shall be</i> with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; He shall cry unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; Also I will make him <i>my</i> firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; His seed also will I make <i>to endure</i> for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <i>as</i> a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown <i>by casting it</i> to the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; What man <i>is he that</i> liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; Lord, where <i>are</i> thy former lovingkindnesses, <i>which</i> thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</p>

<p>%[l|50]&ensp; Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <i>how</i> I do bear in my bosom <i>the reproach of</i> all the mighty people;</p>

<p>%[l|51]&ensp; Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</p>

<p>%[l|52]&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p>
