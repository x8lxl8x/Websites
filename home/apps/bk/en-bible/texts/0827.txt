# Ezekiel 25

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped <i>thine</i> hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah <i>is</i> like unto all the heathen;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities <i>which are</i> on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy <i>it</i> for the old hatred;</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.</p>
