# Ezekiel 29

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the tenth year, in the tenth <i>month</i>, in the twelfth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river <i>is</i> mine own, and I have made <i>it</i> for myself.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And I will leave thee <i>thrown</i> into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD: because he hath said, The river <i>is</i> mine, and I have made <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Behold, therefore I <i>am</i> against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste <i>and</i> desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <i>that are</i> desolate, and her cities among the cities <i>that are</i> laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return <i>into</i> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth <i>their</i> iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <i>month</i>, in the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <i>was</i> made bald, and every shoulder <i>was</i> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; I have given him the land of Egypt <i>for</i> his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</p>
