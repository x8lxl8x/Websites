# Proverbs 10

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; He that gathereth in summer <i>is</i> a wise son: <i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The mouth of a righteous <i>man is</i> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <i>is</i> for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Wise <i>men</i> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> near destruction.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <i>is</i> their poverty.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; The labour of the righteous <i>tendeth</i> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; He <i>is in</i> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He that hideth hatred <i>with</i> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <i>is</i> a fool.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips <i>is</i> wise.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; The tongue of the just <i>is as</i> choice silver: the heart of the wicked <i>is</i> little worth.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; <i>It is</i> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; As the whirlwind passeth, so <i>is</i> the wicked no <i>more</i>: but the righteous <i>is</i> an everlasting foundation.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <i>is</i> the sluggard to them that send him.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; The hope of the righteous <i>shall be</i> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; The way of the LORD <i>is</i> strength to the upright: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked <i>speaketh</i> frowardness.</p>
