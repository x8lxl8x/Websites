# I Samuel 9

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name <i>was</i> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And he had a son, whose name <i>was</i> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <i>there was</i> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <i>he was</i> higher than any of the people.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <i>them</i> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <i>there they were</i> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <i>them</i> not.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; <i>And</i> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <i>was</i> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <i>caring</i> for the asses, and take thought for us.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he said unto him, Behold now, <i>there is</i> in this city a man of God, and <i>he is</i> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <i>if</i> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <i>there is</i> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <i>that</i> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <i>he that is</i> now <i>called</i> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God <i>was</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; <i>And</i> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <i>he is</i> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <i>there is</i> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <i>and</i> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they went up into the city: <i>and</i> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <i>to be</i> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <i>am</i> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that <i>is</i> in thine heart.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <i>is</i> all the desire of Israel? <i>Is it</i> not on thee, and on all thy father's house?</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And Saul answered and said, <i>Am</i> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <i>were</i> about thirty persons.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; And the cook took up the shoulder, and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> upon it, and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, Behold that which is left! set <i>it</i> before thee, <i>and</i> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <i>Samuel</i> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; <i>And</i> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>
