# Genesis 39

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And his master saw that the LORD <i>was</i> with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all <i>that</i> he had he put into his hand.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And it came to pass from the time <i>that</i> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was <i>a</i> goodly <i>person</i>, and well favoured.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what <i>is</i> with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>There is</i> none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou <i>art</i> his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, <i>or</i> to be with her.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And it came to pass about this time, that <i>Joseph</i> went into the house to do his business; and <i>there was</i> none of the men of the house there within.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners <i>were</i> bound: and he was there in the prison.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that <i>were</i> in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer <i>of it</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing <i>that was</i> under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and <i>that</i> which he did, the LORD made <i>it</i> to prosper.</p>
