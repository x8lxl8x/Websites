# Ezekiel 40

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which <i>was</i> as the frame of a city on the south.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And he brought me thither, and, behold, <i>there was</i> a man, whose appearance <i>was</i> like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew <i>them</i> unto thee <i>art</i> thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits <i>long</i> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <i>which was</i> one reed broad; and the other threshold <i>of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And <i>every</i> little chamber <i>was</i> one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers <i>were</i> five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <i>was</i> one reed.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate <i>was</i> inward.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; And the little chambers of the gate eastward <i>were</i> three on this side, and three on that side; they three <i>were</i> of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; <i>and</i> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; The space also before the little chambers <i>was</i> one cubit <i>on this side</i>, and the space <i>was</i> one cubit on that side: and the little chambers <i>were</i> six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He measured then the gate from the roof of <i>one</i> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <i>was</i> five and twenty cubits, door against door.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate <i>were</i> fifty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And <i>there were</i> narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows <i>were</i> round about inward: and upon <i>each</i> post <i>were</i> palm trees.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <i>there were</i> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <i>were</i> upon the pavement.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates <i>was</i> the lower pavement.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And the little chambers thereof <i>were</i> three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, <i>were</i> after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof <i>were</i> before them.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And the gate of the inner court <i>was</i> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And <i>there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And <i>there were</i> seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof <i>were</i> before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And <i>there was</i> a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and <i>there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: <i>it was</i> fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And the arches round about <i>were</i> five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And the arches thereof <i>were</i> toward the utter court; and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, <i>were</i> according to these measures: and <i>there were</i> windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: <i>it was</i> fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And the arches thereof <i>were</i> toward the outward court; and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; And he brought me to the north gate, and measured <i>it</i> according to these measures;</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And the posts thereof <i>were</i> toward the utter court; and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And the chambers and the entries thereof <i>were</i> by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And in the porch of the gate <i>were</i> two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, <i>were</i> two tables; and on the other side, which <i>was</i> at the porch of the gate, <i>were</i> two tables.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; Four tables <i>were</i> on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew <i>their sacrifices</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; And the four tables <i>were</i> of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; And within <i>were</i> hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables <i>was</i> the flesh of the offering.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; And without the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <i>was</i> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <i>was</i> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <i>having</i> the prospect toward the north.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the south, <i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</p>

<p>%[l|46]&ensp; And the chamber whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the north <i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these <i>are</i> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</p>

<p>%[l|47]&ensp; So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar <i>that was</i> before the house.</p>

<p>%[l|48]&ensp; And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured <i>each</i> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <i>was</i> three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</p>

<p>%[l|49]&ensp; The length of the porch <i>was</i> twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and <i>he brought me</i> by the steps whereby they went up to it: and <i>there were</i> pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</p>
