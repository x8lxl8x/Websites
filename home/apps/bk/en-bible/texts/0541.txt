# Psalms 63

<p class="intro">A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O God, thou <i>art</i> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; To see thy power and thy glory, so <i>as</i> I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Because thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; My soul shall be satisfied as <i>with</i> marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise <i>thee</i> with joyful lips:</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; When I remember thee upon my bed, <i>and</i> meditate on thee in the <i>night</i> watches.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But those <i>that</i> seek my soul, to destroy <i>it</i>, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</p>
