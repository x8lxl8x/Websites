# Psalms 95

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; For the LORD <i>is</i> a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; In his hand <i>are</i> the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills <i>is</i> his also.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The sea <i>is</i> his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry <i>land</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For he <i>is</i> our God; and we <i>are</i> the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, <i>and</i> as <i>in</i> the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Forty years long was I grieved with <i>this</i> generation, and said, It <i>is</i> a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
