# Job 26

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; But Job answered and said,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; How hast thou helped <i>him that is</i> without power? <i>how</i> savest thou the arm <i>that hath</i> no strength?</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; How hast thou counselled <i>him that hath</i> no wisdom? and <i>how</i> hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Dead <i>things</i> are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Hell <i>is</i> naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, <i>and</i> hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; He holdeth back the face of his throne, <i>and</i> spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Lo, these <i>are</i> parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
