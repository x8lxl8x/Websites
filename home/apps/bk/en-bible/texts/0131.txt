# Numbers 14

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>which were</i> of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, <i>is</i> an exceeding good land.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they <i>are</i> bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD <i>is</i> with us: fear them not.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear <i>it</i>, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they will tell <i>it</i> to the inhabitants of this land: <i>for</i> they have heard that thou LORD <i>art</i> among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and <i>that</i> thy cloud standeth over them, and <i>that</i> thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now <i>if</i> thou shalt kill <i>all</i> this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing <i>the guilty</i>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; But <i>as</i> truly <i>as</i> I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; How long <i>shall I bear with</i> this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Say unto them, <i>As truly as</i> I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, <i>concerning</i> which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; But <i>as for</i> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, <i>even</i> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, <i>even</i> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>which were</i> of the men that went to search the land, lived <i>still</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we <i>be here</i>, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</p>

<p>%[l|41]&ensp; And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</p>

<p>%[l|42]&ensp; Go not up, for the LORD <i>is</i> not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</p>

<p>%[l|43]&ensp; For the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i>are</i> there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</p>

<p>%[l|44]&ensp; But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</p>

<p>%[l|45]&ensp; Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, <i>even</i> unto Hormah.</p>
