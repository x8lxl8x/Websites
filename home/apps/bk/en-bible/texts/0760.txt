# Jeremiah 15

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, <i>yet</i> my mind <i>could</i> not <i>be</i> toward this people: cast <i>them</i> out of my sight, and let them go forth.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as <i>are</i> for death, to death; and such as <i>are</i> for the sword, to the sword; and such as <i>are</i> for the famine, to the famine; and such as <i>are</i> for the captivity, to the captivity.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for <i>that</i> which he did in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave <i>them</i> of children, I will destroy my people, <i>since</i> they return not from their ways.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused <i>him</i> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while <i>it was</i> yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; <i>yet</i> every one of them doth curse me.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <i>well</i> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <i>that</i> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And I will make <i>thee</i> to pass with thine enemies into a land <i>which</i> thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, <i>which</i> shall burn upon you.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <i>which</i> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <i>and as</i> waters <i>that</i> fail?</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <i>and</i> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I <i>am</i> with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</p>
