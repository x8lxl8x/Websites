# Acts 8

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <i>them</i> to prison.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And there was great joy in that city.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>

<p>%[l|27]&ensp; And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>

<p>%[l|28]&ensp; Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>

<p>%[l|29]&ensp; Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>

<p>%[l|30]&ensp; And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>

<p>%[l|31]&ensp; And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>

<p>%[l|32]&ensp; The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>

<p>%[l|33]&ensp; In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>

<p>%[l|34]&ensp; And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>

<p>%[l|35]&ensp; Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>

<p>%[l|36]&ensp; And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>

<p>%[l|37]&ensp; And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>

<p>%[l|38]&ensp; And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>

<p>%[l|39]&ensp; And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p>%[l|40]&ensp; But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
