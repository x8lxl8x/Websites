# Psalms 55

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <i>for then</i> would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; Lo, <i>then</i> would I wander far off, <i>and</i> remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <i>and</i> tempest.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Destroy, O Lord, <i>and</i> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <i>are</i> in the midst of it.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Wickedness <i>is</i> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; For <i>it was</i> not an enemy <i>that</i> reproached me; then I could have borne <i>it</i>: neither <i>was it</i> he that hated me <i>that</i> did magnify <i>himself</i> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; But <i>it was</i> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; We took sweet counsel together, <i>and</i> walked unto the house of God in company.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Let death seize upon them, <i>and</i> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness <i>is</i> in their dwellings, <i>and</i> among them.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <i>that was</i> against me: for there were many with me.</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; <i>The words</i> of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <i>was</i> in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <i>were</i> they drawn swords.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>
