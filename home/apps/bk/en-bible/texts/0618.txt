# Psalms 140

<p class="intro">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; Which imagine mischiefs in <i>their</i> heart; continually are they gathered together <i>for</i> war.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison <i>is</i> under their lips. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; I said unto the LORD, Thou <i>art</i> my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; <i>lest</i> they exalt themselves. Selah.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; <i>As for</i> the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, <i>and</i> the right of the poor.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
