# I Chronicles 11

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by him</i> at one time.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.</p>

<p>%[l|13]&ensp; He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>

<p>%[l|14]&ensp; And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.</p>

<p>%[l|15]&ensp; Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>%[l|16]&ensp; And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.</p>

<p>%[l|17]&ensp; And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!</p>

<p>%[l|18]&ensp; And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD,</p>

<p>%[l|19]&ensp; And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</p>

<p>%[l|20]&ensp; And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.</p>

<p>%[l|21]&ensp; Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.</p>

<p>%[l|22]&ensp; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</p>

<p>%[l|23]&ensp; And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>

<p>%[l|24]&ensp; These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</p>

<p>%[l|25]&ensp; Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</p>

<p>%[l|26]&ensp; Also the valiant men of the armies <i>were</i>, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>
