# Isaiah 64

<p>%[l|1]&ensp; Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</p>

<p>%[l|2]&ensp; As <i>when</i> the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, <i>that</i> the nations may tremble at thy presence!</p>

<p>%[l|3]&ensp; When thou didst terrible things <i>which</i> we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</p>

<p>%[l|4]&ensp; For since the beginning of the world <i>men</i> have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, <i>what</i> he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</p>

<p>%[l|5]&ensp; Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, <i>those that</i> remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</p>

<p>%[l|6]&ensp; But we are all as an unclean <i>thing</i>, and all our righteousnesses <i>are</i> as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>%[l|7]&ensp; And <i>there is</i> none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</p>

<p>%[l|8]&ensp; But now, O LORD, thou <i>art</i> our father; we <i>are</i> the clay, and thou our potter; and we all <i>are</i> the work of thy hand.</p>

<p>%[l|9]&ensp; Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we <i>are</i> all thy people.</p>

<p>%[l|10]&ensp; Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</p>

<p>%[l|11]&ensp; Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</p>

<p>%[l|12]&ensp; Wilt thou refrain thyself for these <i>things</i>, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</p>
