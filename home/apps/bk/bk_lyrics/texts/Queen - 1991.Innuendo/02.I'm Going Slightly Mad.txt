When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear

Are they trying to tell you something
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, oh, oh
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Oh dear
What a silly goose
Ha, ha, ha, ha
What a silly goose

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing

I'm coming down with a fever (oooohh)
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over (ooooh, oooh, oooh)
I think I'm a banana tree (oooh, ooh)
Oh dear
What a silly goose

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh, huh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah

I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you
Ahhh, ahhh
What a silly goose

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh, yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad, so there
And there you have it
