If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kinda nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard

But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are

Oooh, don't try so hard
Oooh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard

One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh, you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey, but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try to stand out
From the crowd

Ooh, oh-ooh, what a beautiful world
This is the life for me
Ooh, oh-ooh, what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Ooh, don't try so hard
Ooh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools
They make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
