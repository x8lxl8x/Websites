<h3>Definition of Inverse Function</h3>

<p>An inverse function, which is notated <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)&#10;$</span>
, is defined as the inverse function of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 if it consistently reverses the <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
process. That is, if <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
turns <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
into <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)$</span>
must turn <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
into <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
.  More concisely and formally, <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)$</span>
is the inverse function of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
if:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f({f}^{-1}(x))=x$</div>

<p>Below is a mapping of function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
  and its inverse function, <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)$</span>
.  Notice that the ordered pairs are reversed from the original function to its inverse.  Because <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 maps <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 to <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, the inverse <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)$</span>
 maps <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
back to <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0801.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0801.png' alt='Inverse functions: mapping representation'></a>

<div><b><i>Inverse functions: mapping representation</i></b></div>
<p>An inverse function reverses the inputs and outputs. The mapping f has a, b, and c on the left and 1, 2, 3 on the right, with the mappings a to 3, b to 1, c to 2. The mapping f-inverse (f^-1) has 1, 2, and 3 on the left and a, b, and c on the right, with the mappings 1 to b, 2 to c, 3 to a.</p>

<p>Thus the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)$</span>
 can be obtained from the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 by switching the positions of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axes. This is equivalent to reflecting the graph across the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
, an increasing diagonal line through the origin.</p>



<a href='../images/0802.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0802.png' alt='Inverse functions: graphic representation'></a>

<div><b><i>Inverse functions: graphic representation</i></b></div>
<p>The function graph (red) and its inverse function graph (blue) are reflections of each other about the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
 (dotted black line). Notice that any ordered pair on the red curve has its reversed ordered pair on the blue line. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
 on the red (function) curve is reflected over the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
 and becomes <span class='clFormula'>$(1,0)$</span>
 on the blue (inverse function) curve. Where one curve is on the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
, the curves intersect, as a reflection over the line leaves the point unchanged.</p>


<h3>Write the Inverse Function </h3>

<p>In general, given a function, how do you find its inverse function? Remember that an inverse function reverses the inputs and outputs.  So to find the inverse function, switch the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values of a given function, and then solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 1  </h3>

<p>Find the inverse of : <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span></p>
<p>a. : Write the function as:  <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span></p>
<p>b. : Switch the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
variables: <span class='clFormula'>$x=y^2$</span></p>
<p>c. : Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\begin {align} x&amp;=y^2&#10;\\ \pm\sqrt{x}&amp;=y&#10;\end {align}$</span></p>
<p>Since the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 has multiple outputs, its inverse is not a function. Notice the graphs in the picture below.  Even though the blue curve is a function (passes the vertical line test), its inverse would not be. The red curve for the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$</span>
 is not the full inverse of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span></p>



<a href='../images/0803.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0803.png' alt='The inverse is not a function'></a>

<div><b><i>The inverse is not a function</i></b></div>
<p>A function's inverse may not always be a function.  The function (blue) <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
, includes the points <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,1)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(1,1)$</span>
.  Therefore, the inverse would include the points: <span class='clFormula'>$(1,-1)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(1,1)$</span>
 which the input value repeats, and therefore is not a function. For <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$</span>
 to be a function, it must be defined as positive. The function f(x)=x^2 is a parabola (u-shaped curve) opening up with its vertex at the origin. The function f(x)=square root of x is half a parabola opening to the right, in the first quadrant only.</p>

<h3>Example 2 </h3>

<p>Find the inverse function of : <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=2^x$</span></p>
<p>As soon as the problem includes an exponential function, we know that the logarithm reverses exponentiation.  The complex logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers.  Let's see what happens when we switch the input and output values and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.</p>
<p>a. : Write the function as: <span class='clFormula'>$y = {2}^{x}$</span></p>
<p>b. : Switch the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
variables: <span class='clFormula'>$x = {2}^{y}$</span></p>
<p>c. : Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\begin {align} {log}_{2}x &amp;= {log}_{2}{2}^{y}&#10;\\{log}_{2}x &amp;= y{log}_{2}{2}&#10;\\{log}_{2}x &amp;= y&#10;\\{f}^{1}(x) &amp;= {log}_{2}(x)&#10;\end {align}$</span></p>



<a href='../images/0804.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0804.png' alt='Exponential and logarithm functions'></a>

<div><b><i>Exponential and logarithm functions</i></b></div>
<p>The graphs of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2^x$</span>
 (blue) and <span class='clFormula'>$x=2^y$</span>
 (red) are inverses of one another. The black line represents the line of reflection, in which is <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
. y=2^x is increasing from the x-axis in quadrants 2 and 1. x=2^y is increasing from the y-axis from quadrant 3 to 1. They are reflections of each other over the line y=x.</p>

<p>Test to make sure this solution fills the definition of an inverse function.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a number, and plug it into the original function. <span class='clFormula'>$2\rightarrow f(x)\rightarrow 4$</span>

<li>See if the inverse function reverses this process. <span class='clFormula'>$4\rightarrow f^{-1}(x)\rightarrow 2$</span>

<blockquote>Functional composition allows for the application of one function to another; this step can be undone by using functional decomposition.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice functional composition by applying the rules of one function to the results of another function</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Functional composition applies one function to the results of another.</li>

<li>Decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function.</li>

</dl>

<h3>Function Composition</h3>

<p>The process of combining functions so that the output of one function becomes the input of another is known as a composition of functions. The resulting function is known as a <em>composite function</em>. We represent this combination by the following notation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(fg)(x)=f(g(x))$</div>

<p>We read the left-hand side as "<span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
" composed with <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
 at <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, and the right-hand side as  "<span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
 of <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
 of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
."  The two sides of the equation have the same mathematical meaning and are equal.  The open circle symbol, <span class='clFormula'>$$</span>
, is called the <em>composition operator</em>. Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a new function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new number. </p>

<h3>Function Composition and Evaluation</h3>

<p>It is  important to understand the order of operations in evaluating a composite function. We follow the usual convention with parentheses by starting with the innermost parentheses first, and then working to the outside. </p>
<p>In general,  <span class='clFormula'>$(fg)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(gf)$</span>
 are different functions. In other words, in many cases <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(x))g(f(x))$</span>
for all <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. </p>
<p>Note that the range of the inside function (the first function to be evaluated) needs to be within the domain of the outside function. Less formally, the composition has to make sense in terms of inputs and outputs.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Composite Functions Using Input Values</h3>

<p>When evaluating a composite function where we have either created or been given formulas, the rule of working from the inside out remains the same. The input value to the outer function will be the output of the inner function, which may be a numerical value, a variable name, or a more complicated expression.</p>

<h3>Example 1 </h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=-2x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=x^2-1$</span>
, evaluate <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(3))$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(3))$</span>
.</p>
<p>To evaluate <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(3))$</span>
, first substitute, or input the value of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 into <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
 and find the output.  Then substitute that value into the  <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 function, and simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$g(3)=(3)^2-1=9-1=8$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$f(8)=-2(8)=-16$</div>

<p>Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(3))=-16$</span></p>
<p>To evaluate <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(3))$</span>
, find <span class='clFormula'>$f(3)$</span>
 and then use that output value as the input value into the <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
 function:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(3)=-2(3)=-6$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$g(-6)=(-6)^2-1=36-1=35$</div>

<p>Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(3))=35$</span></p>

<h3>Evaluating Composite Functions Using a Formula</h3>

<p>While we can compose the functions for each individual input value, it is sometimes helpful to find a single formula that will calculate the result of a composition <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(x))$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(x))$</span>
. To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. </p>
<p>In the next example we are given a formula for two composite functions and asked to evaluate the function.  Evaluate the inside function using the input value or variable provided.  Use the resulting output as the input to the outside function.</p>

<h3>Example 2 </h3>

<p> If <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) =-2x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=x^2-1$</span>
, evaluate <span class='clFormula'>$f(g(x))$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(x))$</span>
.</p>
<p>First substitute, or input the function <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-1$</span>
 into the <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 function, and then simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(g(x))=-2(x^2-1)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$f(g(x))=-2x^2+2$</div>

<p>For <span class='clFormula'>$g(f(x))$</span>
, input the <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 function, <span class='clFormula'>$-2x$</span>
 into the <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
 function, and then simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$g(f(x))=(-2x)^2-1&#10;$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$g(f(x))=4x^2-1$</div>


<h3>Functional Decomposition</h3>

<p>Functional decomposition broadly refers to the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed (i.e., recomposed) from those parts by function composition. In general, this process of decomposition is undertaken either for the purpose of gaining insight into the identity of the constituent components (which may reflect individual physical processes of interest), or for the purpose of obtaining a compressed representation of the global function; a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of modularity (<em>i.e.</em>, independence or non-interaction).</p>
<p>In general, functional decompositions are worthwhile when there is a certain "sparseness" in the dependency structure; <em>i.e</em>. when constituent functions are found to depend on approximately disjointed sets of variables. Also, decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function.</p>

<h3>Inverse Functions</h3>

is defined as the inverse function of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
if it consistently reverses the <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>

is the inverse function of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
if <span class='clFormula'>$f({f}^{-1}(x))=x$</span>
.</p>

, then <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}$</span>
 maps <span class='clFormula'>$Y$</span>
 back to <span class='clFormula'>$X$</span>
.
</p>


<h3>Domain Restrictions: Parabola</h3>

<p>Informally, a restriction of a function  is the result of trimming its domain.  
Remember that:
If <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
 maps <span class='clFormula'>$X$</span>
 to <span class='clFormula'>$Y$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}$</span>
 maps <span class='clFormula'>$Y$</span>
 back to <span class='clFormula'>$X$</span>
.  This is not true of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
. </p>
<p>Without any domain restriction, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 does not have an inverse function as it fails the horizontal line test. But if we restrict the domain to be <span class='clFormula'>$x &gt; 0$</span>
then we find that it passes the horizontal line test and therefore has an inverse function.  Below is the graph of the parabola and its "inverse."  Notice that the parabola does not have a "true" inverse because the original function fails the horizontal line test and must have a restricted domain to have an inverse.</p>



<a href='../images/0806.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0806.png' alt='Failure of horizontal line test'></a>

<p>Graph of a parabola with the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
, the U-Shaped curve opening up. This function fails the horizontal line test, and therefore does not have an inverse. The inverse equation, <span class='clFormula'>$y=\sqrt{x}$</span>
 (other graph) only includes the positive input values of the parabola's domain. However, if we restrict the domain to be <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;0$</span>
, then we find that it passes the horizontal line test and will match the inverse function.</p>


<h3>Domain Restriction:  Exponential and Logarithmic Functions </h3>

<p>
Domain restriction is important for inverse functions of exponents and logarithms because sometimes we need to find an unique inverse.  The inverse of an exponential function is a logarithmic function, and the inverse of a logarithmic function is an exponential function.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>





<p>Is  <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
 in the domain of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=log(x)$</span>
?  If so, what is the value of the function when <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
?  Verify the result.</p>
<p>No, the function has no defined value for <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
. To verify, suppose <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
 is in the domain of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=log(x)$</span>
. Then there is some number <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 such that <span class='clFormula'>$n=log(0)$</span>

<ul>
<li>The composition of functions is always associative. That is, if <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
are three functions with suitably chosen domains and co-domains, then <span class='clFormula'>$ f  (g  h) = (f  g)  h$</span>

<h3>Composition and Composite Functions</h3>

<p>In mathematics, <em>function composition</em> is the application of one function to the results of another.</p>



<a href='../images/0807.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0807.png' alt='Composition of functions'></a>

<div><b><i>Composition of functions</i></b></div>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$g \circ f$</span>
, the composition of <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(g\circ f)(c) = \#$</span>
. On the left, the domain X, with a, b, c, and d, undergoes function f, mapping them to another group of elements Y (in the middle), 1, 2, 3, and 4. a and b are mapped to 1, c is mapped to 3, and d is mapped to 4. The elements of Y are mapped by function g to a group of elements Z on the right. 1 is mapped to @, 2 and 3 are mapped to #, and 4 is mapped to !!</p>

<p>The functions <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
are said to commute with each other if <span class='clFormula'>$g  f = f  g$</span>
. In general, the composition of functions will not be commutative. </p>
<p>A composite function
represents in one function the results of an entire chain of dependent functions. For example, if a school becomes larger, the supply of food in the cafeteria must become larger. This would entail ordering more sandwiches, which means ordering more ingredients, drinks, plates, etc. The entire chain of dependent functions are the ingredients, drinks, plates, etc., and the one composite function would be putting the entire chain together in order to calculate a larger population at the school.</p>

<h3>Inverses and Composition</h3>

<p>Let's go through the relationship between inverses and composition in this example. let's take two functions, compose and invert them. </p>
<p>Find: <span class='clFormula'>$(fg)'(x)(f\circ g)' (x)$</span></p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin {align}f(x)&amp;={x}^{2}&#10;\\g(x)&amp;=x+1&#10;\end {align}$</div>

<p>First, compose them by applying the function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
to the result of applying function <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin {align}(f\circ g)(x)&amp;=f(x+1)=(x+1)^2&#10;\\y&amp;=(x+1)^2&#10;\\\sqrt {y}&amp;=x+1&#10;\\\sqrt{y}-1&amp;=x&#10;\end {align}$</div>

<p><span class='clFormula'>$$</span>
Then, invert it by switching the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
variables:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin {align} \sqrt{x}-1&amp;=y&#10;\\\sqrt{x}-1&amp;=(f\circ g)' (x)&#10;\end {align}$</div>

<blockquote>Logarithmic functions and exponential functions are inverses of each other. That is, they undo each other. </blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain the relationship between logarithmic functions and exponential functions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
denotes the inverse function. That is, <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)&#10;$</span>
is the inverse of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
.</li>
<li>An inverse function is a function that undoes another function: If an input <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
into the function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
produces an output <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, then inputting <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
into the inverse function <span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
produces the output <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, and vice versa (i.e., <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=y$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$g(y)=x$</span>
). </li>
<li>The logarithm to base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is the inverse function of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = b^x$</span>
: <span class='clFormula'>$\log _{ b }{ { (b) }^{ x } } = x\log _{ b }{ (b) } =x$</span></li>
<li>The natural logarithm <span class='clFormula'>$ln(x)$</span>
is the inverse of the exponential function <span class='clFormula'>$e^x$</span>
:<span class='clFormula'>$b={ e }^{ lnb }$</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>inverse function</dt>
<dd>A function that does exactly the opposite of another.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The inverse of an exponential function is a logarithmic function and vice versa. That is, the two functions undo each other. Thus <span class='clFormula'>$log_{b}b^{x}=x&#10;$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b^{log_{b}x}=x&#10;$</span>
. Composing the functions in either order leaves the initial input unchanged. </p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that if <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=log_{b}x&#10;$</span>
, then the inverse function is given by <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)=b^{x}&#10;$</span>
, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Lastly, as with all inverse functions, if we graph <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=log_{b}x&#10;$</span>
  and <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)=b^{x}$</span>
on the same plane, the graphs will be symmetric across the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
. That is, if we fold the plane over the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
, the two curves will lie on each other. Another way of thinking about this is that if we generate points on the curve of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=log_{b}x$</span>
we can find the points on the curve of  <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)=b^{x}$</span>
by interchanging the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates of the points.</p>
<p>In the following graph you can see an exponential function in red and its inverse, a logarithmic function, in blue. The graphs are symmetric over the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
, which is pictured in black. Further, a point <span class='clFormula'>$(t,u=b^t)$</span>
on the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
yields a point <span class='clFormula'>$(u,t=log{_b}u)$</span>
on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. </p>

(red) at the diagonal line (<span class='clFormula'>$x=y$</span>

<p>Thus far we have been looking at logs of the base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. Let us consider instead the natural log (a logarithm of the base <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>

. It is defined for <span class='clFormula'>$e&gt;0$</span>
, and satisfies <span class='clFormula'>$f^{-1}(x)=lnx&#10;$</span>

<blockquote>The logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice working with logarithmic functions and identify their parts</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The inverse of the logarithmic operation is exponentiation.</li>
<li>The logarithm is commonly used in many fields: that with base <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
in computer science, that with base <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>

<dd>The logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In its simplest form, a logarithm is an exponent. Taking the logarithm of a number, one finds the exponent to which a certain value, known as a base, is raised to produce that number once more.</p>
<p>Logarithms have the following structure: <span class='clFormula'>$log{_b}(x)=c$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is known as the base, <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is the exponent to which the base is raised to afford <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. The base <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;0$</span>
.</p>
<p>Note that <span class='clFormula'>$log{_b}x=c$</span>
is not defined for <span class='clFormula'>$c&lt;0$</span>
. This is because the base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is positive and raising a positive number to any power will yield a non-negative number.</p>

<h3>Commonly Used Bases</h3>

<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
is called a common logarithm and is denoted simply as <span class='clFormula'>$logx$</span>
. The common log is used often in science and engineering.</p>
<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is called a natural logarithm and is denoted <span class='clFormula'>$lnx$</span>
. The irrational number  <span class='clFormula'>$e\approx 2.718&#10;$</span>
arises naturally in financial mathematics, in computations having to do with compound interest and annuities.</p>
<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
is called a binary logarithm. While it has no special notation, it is often used in computer science.</p>

<h3>The Exponential and Logarithmic Forms of an Equation</h3>

<p>Logarithmic equations can be written as exponential equations and vice versa. The logarithmic equation <span class='clFormula'>$log_b(x)=c$</span>
corresponds to the exponential equation <span class='clFormula'>$b^{c}=x$</span>
.</p>
<p>As an example, the logarithmic equation <span class='clFormula'>$log{_2}16=4$</span>
corresponds to the exponential equation <span class='clFormula'>$2^4=16$</span>
.</p>
<p><em>Example 1:</em> Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$log{_3}(243)=x$</span>
. </p>
<p>Here we are looking for the exponent to which <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
is raised to yield <span class='clFormula'>$243$</span>
. </p>
<p>It might be more familiar if we convert the equation to exponential form giving us:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$3^x=243&#10;\\ 3^5 =243$</span>
 </p>
<p>Thus, <span class='clFormula'>$log{_3}(243)=5$</span>
.</p>
<p>The explanation of the previous example reveals the inverse of the logarithmic operation: exponentiation. Starting with <span class='clFormula'>$243$</span>
, if we take its logarithm with base <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, then raise <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
to the logarithm, we will once again arrive at <span class='clFormula'>$243$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Trivial Logarithmic Identities</h3>

<p><span class='clFormula'>$log_{b}1=0&#10;$</span>
 as  <span class='clFormula'>$b^0=1$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$b\neq 0&#10;$</span>
. Note that <span class='clFormula'>$0^0\neq 1&#10;&#10;$</span>
. Rather, <span class='clFormula'>$0^0$</span>
is called an indeterminate form.</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$log{_b}b=1$</span>
as <span class='clFormula'>$b^1=b$</span></p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$log{_b}0=undefined$</span>
, as there is no number x such that <span class='clFormula'>$b^x=0$</span></p>
<p>The following two logarithmic identities can be verified by converting the logarithmic equation into an exponential equation as follows:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$b^{log_{b}(x)}=x&#10;$</span>
 </p>
<p>Converting this to a logarithmic equation yields: <span class='clFormula'>$log_{b}(x)=log_{b}(x)$</span></p>
<p>Converting <span class='clFormula'>$log_{b}(b^x)=x$</span>
to an exponential equation yields <span class='clFormula'>$b^x=b^x$</span></p>

<h3>Applications of Logarithms</h3>

<p>Historically, logarithms were invented by John Napier as a way of doing lengthy arithmetic calculations prior to the invention of the modern day calculator. </p>
<p>More recently, logarithms are most commonly used to simplify complex calculations that involve high-level exponents. In chemistry, for example, pH and pKa are used to simplify concentrations and dissociation constants, respectively, of high exponential value. The purpose is to bring wide-ranging values into a more manageable scope. A dissociation constant may be smaller than <span class='clFormula'>$10^{10}$</span>
, or higher than <span class='clFormula'>$10^{-50}$</span>
. Taking the logarithm of each brings the values into a more comprehensible scope (<span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$-50$</span>
) .</p>

<h3>Logarithms: History and Common Bases</h3>

<p>Logarithms were originally invented by John Napier (1515-1617) to aid in arithmetical computations at a time when modern day calculators were not in use. In the present day, logarithms have many uses in disciplines as different as economics, computer science, engineering and natural sciences. Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which sound pressure is a common example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.</p>


<p>While any  positive number can be used as the base of a logarithm, not all logarithms are equally useful in practice. Some bases have more applications than others. Out of the infinite number of possible bases, three stand out as particularly useful. These are <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
.</p>

<h3>The Common Logarithm</h3>

<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
is called a common logarithm and is denoted simply as <span class='clFormula'>$logx$</span>
. Common logarithms are often used in physical and natural sciences and engineering. </p>

<h3>The Natural Logarithm</h3>

<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is called a natural logarithm and is denoted <span class='clFormula'>$lnx$</span>
. The irrational number  <span class='clFormula'>$e\approx 2.718&#10;$</span>
and arises naturally in financial mathematics in computations having to do with compound interest. Natural logarithms are also used in physical sciences and pure math. </p>

<h3>The Binary Logarithm</h3>

<p>A logarithm with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
is called a binary logarithm and is denoted <span class='clFormula'>$ldn$</span>
. Binary logarithms are useful in any application that involves the doubling of a quantity, and particularly in computer science with the use of integral parts.</p>

<h3>Uses of Logarithms</h3>

<p>The list below highlights only some of the many uses of logarithms in the present day.</p>
<p> 1. The magnitude of an earthquake (M) can be determined based on the logarithm of an intensity measurement from a seismograph (I):</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$M=log(\frac{I}{I_0})$</span>
where I<sub>0</sub> is a constant. </p>
<p>2. The common logarithm is used in calculating the safety index which helps determine how safe certain activities are by determining how likely people are to die from them. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
in <span class='clFormula'>$2,000,000$</span>
people is killed by lightning. It might be hard to get a real sense of how likely one is to die by getting hit by lightning because <span class='clFormula'>$2,000,000$</span>
is such a large number and our minds cannot make sense of it easily.  If one in <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
people die as a result of doing some given activity each year, the safety index
for that activity is simply the logarithm of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. The higher the safety
index, the safer the activity in question. The safety index, because it is a logarithm, is a much smaller number. Logarithms help to shrink
the numbers of very high magnitude to a smaller ones, which our brains can deal with easily. </p>
<p>3. pH is an abbreviation for power of hydrogen. The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is. It ranges from <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$14$</span>
. A pH of <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
is neutral (water). A pH less than <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
is acidic, and a pH greater than <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
is basic. The acidity depends on the hydrogen ion concentration in the liquid (in moles per liter) written as [H+]. The greater the hydrogen ion concentration, the more acidic the solution. It is defined as <span class='clFormula'>$pH = -log10[H+]$</span>
. </p>
<p>Pure water contains a hydrogen ion concentration of <span class='clFormula'>$1 \cdot 10^{-7}$</span>
moles. It has a pH level of <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
.  Clearly, <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
is an easier number for our brain to handle. This is an example of how logarithms helps us to deal with numbers of very small magnitudes. </p>


<p>4. The entropy <span class='clFormula'>$(S)$</span>
of a system can be calculated from the natural logarithm of the number of possible microstates <span class='clFormula'>$(W)$</span>
 the system can adopt:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$S=k \cdot ln(W)$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
is a constant.</p>
<p>5. Logarithms occur in definitions of the dimension of fractals. Fractals are geometric objects that are self-similar: small parts reproduce, at least roughly, the entire global structure. The Sierpinski triangle can be covered by three copies of itself, each having sides half the original length. This makes the Hausdorff dimension of this structure <span class='clFormula'>$ln(3)/ln(2)  1.58$</span>
. Another logarithm-based notion of dimension is obtained by counting the number of boxes needed to cover the fractal in question. </p>



<a href='../images/0809.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0809.png' alt='Sierpinski triangle'></a>

<div><b><i>Sierpinski triangle</i></b></div>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle can be covered by three copies of itself, over, and over, and over.</p>

<p>
6. Logarithms are related to musical tones and intervals. In equal temperament, the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or pitch, of the individual tones. For example, the note A has a frequency of <span class='clFormula'>$440$</span>
 Hz and <em>B-flat</em> has a frequency of <span class='clFormula'>$466$</span>
 Hz. The interval between <em>A</em> and <em>B-flat</em> is a semitone, as is the one between <em>B-flat</em> and B (frequency <span class='clFormula'>$493$</span>
 Hz). Therefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the base-<span class='clFormula'>$\frac {21}{12}$</span>
logarithm of the frequency ratio.</p>


<p>
7. Natural logarithms are closely linked to counting prime numbers (<span class='clFormula'>$2, 3, 5, 7$</span>
...), an important topic in number theory. The prime number theorem states that for large enough  <em>N</em>, the probability that a random integer not greater than <em>N</em> is prime is very close to <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1} {log(N)}$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} x-2&amp;=6^3&#10;\\x-2&amp;=216&#10;\\x&amp;=218 \end{align}$</div>


<h3>Solving Exponential Equations</h3>

<p>An exponential equation is an equation where the variable we are solving for appears in the exponent. </p>
<p>If the equation consists of two terms set equal to each other and these terms have the same base, then the exponents are equal. We can use this fact to solve such exponential equations as follows:</p>

<h3>Example 3 </h3>

<p>Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$5^{5x+8}=5^{x^{2}+3x}$</span></p>
<p>Here since the bases are both <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
, the exponents are equal. We use this fact to solve the equation as follows:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 5x+8&amp;=x^2+3x \\ 0&amp;=x^2+3x-5x-8 \\ 0&amp;=x^2-2x-8 \\ 0&amp;=(x-4)(x+2) \end{align}$</span></p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=4 \text{ or } x=-2$</div>


<h3>Example 4 </h3>

<p>Solve for x in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$3^{x+1}=81^x$</span></p>
<p>Here the bases are not equal, but it is possible to write 81 using a base of 3 as follows:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3^{x+1}&amp;=(3^4)^x \\ 3^{x+1}&amp;=3^{4x} \end{align}$</span></p>
<p>At this point, the left and right sides of the equation have the same base so we can solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
by setting the two exponents equal to each other:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} x+1&amp;=4x \\ 1&amp;=4x-x \\ 1&amp;=3x \\ x&amp;=\frac{1}{3} \end{align}&#10;$</div>


<h3>Solving Exponential Equations Using Logarithms</h3>

<p>In many cases, an exponential equation cannot be solved by using the methods of example <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
above because the bases cannot easily be made equal. In these cases taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation allows us to solve the equation. While you can take the log to any base, it is common to use the common log with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
or the natural log with the base of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. This is because scientific and graphing calculators are equipped with a button for the common log that reads <span class='clFormula'>$log$</span>
, and a button for the natural log that reads <span class='clFormula'>$ln$</span>
which allows us to obtain a good approximation for the common or natural log of a number.</p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

<p>Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$2^x=17$</span></p>
<p>Here we cannot easily write <span class='clFormula'>$17$</span>
with a base of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
so instead we take the <em>log</em> of both sides as follows.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\log{2^x}=\log17$</div>

<p>Next we use the properties of logarithms to move the variable out of the exponent.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x\log2=\log17$</div>

<p>Lastly we divide by <span class='clFormula'>$\log2$</span>
to solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{\log17}{\log2}&#10;$</div>

<p>It is important to note that this is an exact answer. We can arrive at an approximation by using the <span class='clFormula'>$\log$</span>
button on your calculator.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{\log17}{\log2}\approx4.0877&#10;$</div>


<h3>Example 6</h3>

<p>Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$2^x=17$</span>
using the natural log</p>
<p>Here we will use the natural logarithm instead to illustrate the fact that any base will do.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \ln{2^x}&amp;=\ln17 \\ x\ln2&amp;=\ln17 \\x&amp;=\frac{\ln17}{\ln2}\approx4.0877 \end{align}&#10;$</div>


<h3>Example 7 </h3>

<p>Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in the equation <span class='clFormula'>$3=4^{5x+18}&#10;$</span></p>
<p>Again, we use logarithms to move the variable out of the exponent allowing us to solve for x as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \log3&amp;=\log4^{5x+18} \\ \log3&amp;=(5x+8)\log4 \\ \frac{\log3}{\log4}&amp;=5x+8 \\ \frac{\log3}{\log4}-8&amp;=5x \\ \frac{\log3}{5\log4}-\frac{8}{5}&amp;=x \\ \frac{\log3-8\log4}{5\log4}&amp;=x \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now we can use the properties of logarithms to re-write the left hand side and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{\log\frac{3}{4^8}}{\log4^5}=\dfrac{\log\frac{3}{65536}}{\log1024}\approx-1.4415$</div>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>At the most basic level, an exponential function is a function in which the variable appears in the exponent. The most basic exponential function is a function of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a positive number.</p>
<p>When <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;1$</span>
the function grows in a manner that is proportional to its original value. This is called exponential growth. </p>
<p>When <span class='clFormula'>$0&gt;b&gt;1$</span>
the function decays in a manner that is proportional to its original value. This is called exponential decay.</p>

<h3>Graphing an Exponential Function</h3>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Let us consider the function <span class='clFormula'>$y=2^x$</span>
 when <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;1$</span>
. One way to graph this function is to choose values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and substitute these into the equation to generate values for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. Doing so we may obtain the following points:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,\frac{1}{4})$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,\frac{1}{2})$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(1,2)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4)$</span></p>
<p>As you connect the points, you will notice a smooth curve that crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis at the point <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
and is increasing as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
takes on larger and larger values. That is, the curve approaches infinity as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches infinity. As <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
takes on smaller and smaller values the curve gets closer and closer to the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. That is, the curve approaches zero as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches negative infinity making the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis is a horizontal asymptote of the function. The point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,b)$</span>
is on the graph. This is true of the graph of all exponential functions of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;1$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0810.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0810.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2^x$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The graph of this function crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis at <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
 and increases as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 approaches infinity. The <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis is a horizontal asymptote of the function.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Let us consider the function <span class='clFormula'>$y=\frac{1}{2}^x$</span>
 when <span class='clFormula'>$0&lt;b&lt;1$</span>
. One way to graph this function is to choose values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and substitute these into the equation to generate values for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. Doing so you can obtain the following points:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,4)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,2)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(1,\frac{1}{2})$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(2,\frac{1}{4})$</span></p>
<p>As you connect the points you will notice a smooth curve that crosses the y-axis at the point <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
and is decreasing as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
takes on larger and larger values. The
curve approaches infinity zero as  approaches infinity. As <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
takes on
smaller and smaller values the curve gets closer and closer to the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. That is, the curve approaches zero as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches negative
infinity making the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis  a horizontal asymptote of the function. The point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,b)$</span>
is on the graph. This is true of the graph of all exponential functions of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$0&lt;x&lt;1$</span>
.</p>
<p>As you can see in the graph below, the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=\frac{1}{2}^x$</span>
is symmetric to that of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2^x$</span>
over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.  That is, if the plane were folded over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, the two curves would lie on each other. </p>



<a href='../images/0811.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0811.png' alt='Graph of  and '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2^x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y=\frac{1}{2}^x$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The graphs of these functions are symmetric over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.</p>


<h3>Why Must <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
Be a Positive Number?</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$b=1$</span>
, then the function becomes <span class='clFormula'>$y=1^x$</span>
. As <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
to any power yields <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, the function is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$y=1$</span>
which is a horizontal line, not an exponential equation.</p>
<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is negative, then raising <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
to an even power results in a positive value for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
while raising <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
to an odd power results in a negative value for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, making it impossible to join the points obtained an any meaningful way and certainly not in a way that generates a curve as those in the examples above.</p>

<h3>Properties of Exponential Graphs</h3>

<p>The point <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
is always on the graph of an exponential function of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
because <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is positive and any positive number to the zero power yields <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>
<p>The point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,b)$</span>
is always on the graph of an exponential function of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
because any positive number <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
raised to the first power yields <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>
<p>The  function  <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
takes on only positive values because any positive number <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
will yield only positive values when raised to any power.</p>
<p> The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=b^x$</span>
has the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis as a horizontal asymptote because the curve will always approach the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches either positive or negative infinity, but will never cross the axis as it will never be equal to zero.</p>

<ul>
<li>When graphed, the logarithmic function is similar in shape to the square root function, but with a vertical asymptote as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>

<li>The point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,0)$</span>

</dl>

<p>Below are graphs of logarithmic functions with bases 2, <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
, and 10. </p>



<a href='../images/0812.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0812.png' alt='Logarithmic Graphs'></a>

<div><b><i>Logarithmic Graphs</i></b></div>
<p>After <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
, where the graphs cross the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, <span class='clFormula'>$\log_2(x)$</span>
in red is above <span class='clFormula'>$\log_e(x)$</span>
in green, which is above <span class='clFormula'>$\log_{10}(x)$</span>
in blue. Before this point, the order is reversed. All three logarithms have the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis as a vertical asymptote, and are always increasing.</p>

<p>All three logarithmic graphs begin with a steep climb after <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, but stretch more and more horizontally, their slope ever-decreasing as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
increases. All of them cross the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis at <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Properties of the Graphs of Logarithmic Functions </h3>

<h3>Special Points</h3>

<p>The graph crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis at <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. That is, the graph has an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept of <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, and as such, the point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,0)$</span>
is on the graph. In fact, the point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,0)$</span>
will always be on the graph of a function of the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}x$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;0$</span>
. This is because for <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
, the equation of the graph becomes <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}1$</span>
. </p>
<p>Thus, we are looking for an exponent <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
such that <span class='clFormula'>$b^y=1$</span>
. As <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;0$</span>
, the exponent we seek is <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
irrespective of the value of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. This means the point <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)=(1,0)$</span>
will always be on a logarithmic function of this type.</p>

<h3>Asymptotes</h3>

<p>The <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis is a vertical asymptote of the graph. This means that the curve gets closer and closer to the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis but does not cross it. </p>
<p>Let us consider what happens as the value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches zero from the right for the equation whose graph appears above. Namely, <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}x$</span>
. We can do this by choosing values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, plugging them into the equation and generating values for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. </p>
<p>Let us assume that <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a positive number greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, and let us investigate values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
between <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. Under these conditions, if we let <span class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{1}{b}$</span>
, the equation becomes  <span class='clFormula'>$y=log\frac{1}{b}$</span>
. </p>
<p>Thus, we are looking for an exponent such that <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 raised to that exponent yields <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{b}$</span>
. The exponent we seek is <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
and the  point <span class='clFormula'>$(\frac{1}{b},-1)$</span>
is on the graph. Similarly, we can obtain the following points that are also on the graph:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(\frac{1}{b^2},-2),(\frac{1}{b^3},-3),(\frac{1}{b^4},-4)$</span>
and so on </p>
<p>If we take values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
that are even closer to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, we can arrive at the following points: <span class='clFormula'>$(\frac{1}{b^{10}},-10),(\frac{1}{b^{100}},-100)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(\frac{1}{b^{1000}},-1000)$</span>
 </p>
<p>As can be seen the closer the value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
gets to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, the more and more negative the graph becomes. That is, as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 approaches zero the graph approaches negative infinity. This means that the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis is a vertical asymptote of the function.</p>

<h3>Domain and Range</h3>

<p>The domain of the function is all positive numbers. That means that the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value of the function will always be positive. Let us begin by considering why the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value of the curve is never <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. </p>
<p>If the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value were zero, the function would read <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}0$</span>
. </p>
<p>Here we are looking for an exponent such that <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
raised to that exponent is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. Since <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a positive number, there is no exponent that we can raise <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
to so as to obtain <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. In fact, since <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is positive, raising it to a power will always yield a positive number.</p>
<p>The range of the function is all real numbers. That is, the graph can take on any real number.</p>

<h3>Comparing <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_x}$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y=\sqrt{x}$</span></h3>

<p>At first glance, the graph of the logarithmic function can easily be mistaken for that of the square root function.</p>



<a href='../images/0813.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0813.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=\sqrt{x}$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The graph of the square root function resembles the graph of the logarithmic function, but does not have a vertical asymptote. Half of a sideways parabola (u-shaped curve) with a vertex at the origin. It does not have a vertical asymptote like a logarithmic function, as it touches the y-axis.</p>

<p>Both the square root and logarithmic functions have a domain limited to <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values greater than <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. However, the logarithmic function has a vertical asymptote descending towards <span class='clFormula'>$-\infty$</span>
as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, whereas the square root reaches a minimum <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value of <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. The range of the square root function is all non-negative real numbers, whereas the range of the logarithmic function is all real numbers.</p>

<h3>Graphing Logarithmic Functions</h3>

<p>Graphing logarithmic functions can be done by locating points on the curve either manually or with a calculator. </p>
<p>When graphing without a calculator, we use the fact that the inverse of a logarithmic function is an exponential function. </p>
<p>When graphing with a calculator, we use the fact that the calculator can compute only common logarithms (base is <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
), natural logarithms (base is <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
) or binary logarithms (base is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
). Of course, if we have a graphing calculator, the calculator can graph the function without the need for us to find points on the graph.</p>

<h3>Graphing Logarithmic Functions Using Their Inverses</h3>

<p>Logarithmic functions can be graphed by hand without the use of a calculator if we use the fact that they are inverses of exponential functions.   </p>
<p>Let us again consider the graph of the following function:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_3}x$</span>
 </p>
<p>This can be written in exponential form as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^y=x$</div>

<p>Now let us consider the inverse of this function. To do so, we interchange <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$3^x=y$</span>
 </p>
<p>The exponential function <span class='clFormula'>$3^x=y$</span>
is one we can easily generate points for. If we take some values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and plug them into the equation to find the corresponding values for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
we can obtain the following points:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,\frac{1}{9}),(-1,\frac{1}{3}),(0,1),(1,3),(2,9)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(3,27)$</span>
 </p>
<p>Now we must note that these points are not on the original function (<span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_3}x$</span>
) but rather on its inverse <span class='clFormula'>$3^x=y$</span>
. However, if we interchange the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates of each point we will in fact obtain a list of points on the original function. </p>
<p>These are:  <span class='clFormula'>$(\frac{1}{9},-2),(\frac{1}{3},-1),(1,0),(3,1),(9,2)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(27,3)$</span>
. </p>
<p>We plot and connect these points to obtain the graph of the function <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_3}x$</span>
below.</p>

<p>The graph of the logarithmic function with base <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 can be generated using the function's inverse. Its shape is the same as other logarithmic functions, just with a different scale.</p>

<h3>Graphing Logarithmic Functions With Bases Between <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span></h3>

<p>Thus far we have graphed logarithmic functions whose bases are greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. If we instead consider logarithmic functions with a base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, such that <span class='clFormula'>$0&lt;b&lt;1$</span>
, we get a graph that is very similar to those we have seen already. </p>
<p>In fact if <span class='clFormula'>$b&gt;0$</span>
, the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}x$</span>
and the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_\frac{1}{b}}x$</span>
are symmetric over the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. Thus, if we identify a point <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
on the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_b}x$</span>
, we can find the corresponding point on <span class='clFormula'>$y=log{_\frac{1}{b}}x$</span>
by changing the sign of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate. The corresponding point is <span class='clFormula'>$(x,-y)$</span>
.</p>
<p>Here is an example for <span class='clFormula'>$b=2$</span>
.</p>

<blockquote>Some functions with rapidly changing shape are best plotted on a scale that increases exponentially, such as a logarithmic graph.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Convert problems to logarithmic scales and discuss the advantages of doing so</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Logarithmic graphs use logarithmic scales, in which the values differ exponentially. For example, instead of including marks at <span class='clFormula'>$0,1,2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, a logarithmic scale may include marks at <span class='clFormula'>$0.1, 1, 10$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
, each an equal distance from the previous and next.</li>
<li>Logarithmic graphs allow one to plot a very large range of data without losing the shape of the graph.</li>
<li>Logarithmic graphs make it easier to interpolate in areas that may be difficult to read on linear axes. For example, if the plot <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^5$</span>
is scaled to show a very wide range of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values, the curvature near the origin may be indistinguishable on linear axes. It is much clearer on logarithmic axes.</li>

<h3>Why Use a Logarithmic Scale?</h3>

<p>Many mathematical and physical relationships are functionally dependent on high-order variables. This means that for small changes in the independent variable there are very large changes in the dependent variable. Thus, it becomes difficult to graph such functions on the standard axis.</p>
<p>Consider, as an example, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the power (j<sup>*</sup>) emitted by a black body to temperature (T).</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$j^*= \sigma T^4$</div>

<p>On a standard graph, this equation can be quite unwieldy. The fourth-degree dependence on temperature means that power increases extremely quickly. The fact that the rate is ever-increasing (and steeply so) means that changing scale (scaling the axes by <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
or even <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
) is of little help in making the graph easier to interpret.</p>
<p>For very steep functions, it is possible to plot points more smoothly while retaining the integrity of the data: one can use a graph with a logarithmic scale, where instead of each space on a graph representing a constant increase, it represents an exponential increase. Where a normal (linear) graph might have equal intervals going 1, 2, 3, 4, a logarithmic scale would have those same equal intervals represent 1, 10, 100, 1000. Here are some examples of functions graphed on a linear scale, semi-log and logarithmic scales. </p>
<p>The top left is a linear scale. The bottom right is a logarithmic scale. The top right and bottom left are called semi-log scales because one axis is scaled linearly while the other is scaled using logarithms.</p>



<a href='../images/0816.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0816.png' alt='Logarithmic scale'></a>

<div><b><i>Logarithmic scale</i></b></div>
<p>The graphs of functions <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=10^x,f(x)=x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\log x$</span>
on four different coordinate plots. Top Left is a linear scale, top right and bottom left are semi-log scales and bottom right is a logarithmic scale. The linear and logarithmic scales preserve the relative shapes of the functions. The semi-log scales, where only the x or y axis is on a logarithmic scale, skew the shapes of the graphs relative to both axes having the same scale.</p>

<p>As you can see, when both axis used a logarithmic scale (bottom right) the graph retained the properties of the original graph (top left) where both axis were scaled using a linear scale. That means that if we want to graph a function that is unwieldy on a linear scale we can use a logarithmic scale on each axis and retain the properties of the graph while at the same time making it easier to graph. </p>
<p>With the semi-log scales, the functions have shapes that are skewed relative to the original. When only the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis has a log scale, the logarithmic curve appears as a line and the linear and exponential curves both look exponential. When only the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis has a log scale, the exponential curve appears as a line and the linear and logarithmic curves both appear logarithmic.It should be noted that the examples in the graphs were meant to illustrate a point and that the functions graphed were not necessarily unwieldy on a linearly scales set of axes.</p>

<h3>Converting Linear to Logarithmic Scales</h3>

<p>The primary difference between the logarithmic and linear scales is that, while the difference in value between linear points of equal distance remains constant (that is, if the space from <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
on the scale is <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 cm on the page, the distance from <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, etc., will be the same), the difference in value between points on a logarithmic scale will change exponentially. A logarithmic scale will start at a certain power of <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, and with every unit will increase by a power of <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
.</p>
<p>Thus, if one wanted to convert a linear scale (with values <span class='clFormula'>$0-5$</span>
to a logarithmic scale, one option would be to replace <span class='clFormula'>$1,2,3,4$</span>
and 5 with <span class='clFormula'>$0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
, respectively. Between each major value on the logarithmic scale, the hashmarks become increasingly closer together with increasing value. For example, in the space between <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, the <span class='clFormula'>$8$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
are much closer together than the <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
.</p>
<p>The advantages of using a logarithmic scale are twofold. Firstly, doing so allows one to plot a very large range of data without losing the shape of the graph. Secondly, it allows one to interpolate at any point on the plot, regardless of the range of the graph. Similar data plotted on a linear scale is less clear.</p>

<h3>Solving Problems Using Logarithmic Graphs</h3>

<p>A key point about using logarithmic graphs to solve problems is that they expand scales to the point at which large ranges of data make more sense. In the equation mentioned above (<span class='clFormula'>$j^*= \sigma T^4$</span>
), plotting <span class='clFormula'>$j$</span>
vs. <span class='clFormula'>$T$</span>
would generate the expected curve, but the scale would be such that minute changes go unnoticed and the large scale effects of the relationship dominate the graph: It is so big that the "interesting areas" won't fit on the paper on a readable scale.</p>
<p>Taking the logarithm of each side of the equations yields: <span class='clFormula'>$logj=log{(\sigma\tau ) }^4&#10;$</span>
. We now rely on the properties of logarithms to re-write the equation. </p>
<p>Recall the following properties of logarithms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b) \\ \log(a)^b=(b)\log(a)$</div>

<p>Using the above, our equation becomes: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \log j&amp;=4\log{(\sigma\tau ) } \\ &amp;=4\log{(\sigma)}+4\log{(\tau ) } \\ &amp;=4\log{(\tau ) }+4\log{(\sigma)} \end{align} $</div>

<h3>Logarithms</h3>

<p>The logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number. For example, the logarithm of <span class='clFormula'>$1000$</span>
in base <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, because <span class='clFormula'>$10^3=1000.$</span>
 </p>
<p>More generally, if <span class='clFormula'>$x=b^y$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
is the logarithm base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
,  written: <span class='clFormula'>$y=\log_b(x)$</span>
, so <span class='clFormula'>$\log_{10}(1000)=3$</span>
. </p>
<p>It is useful to think of logarithms as inverses of exponentials. So, for example:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_b(b^z)=z$</span>
 </p>
<p>And: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;b^{\log_b(z)}=z$</div>


<h3>Product Rule for Logarithms</h3>

<p>Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations. Logarithms were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily by using slide rules and logarithm tables. Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition, because of the fact that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)$</div>

<p>We can see that this rule is true by writing the logarithms in terms of exponentials. </p>
<p>Let <span class='clFormula'>$\log_b(x)=v$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$\log_b(y)=w.$</span>
 </p>
<p>Writing these equations as exponentials: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;b^v=x$</span>
 </p>
<p>And: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;b^w=y.$</span>
 </p>
<p>Then note that: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;xy&amp;=b^vb^w\\ &#10;&amp;=b^{v+w}&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Taking the logarithm base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 of both sides of this last equation yields: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\log_b(xy)&amp;=\log_b(b^{v+w})\\&#10;&amp;=v+w\\&#10;&amp;=\log_b(x) + \log_b(y)&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p> This is a very useful property of logarithms, because it can sometimes simplify more complex expressions. For example:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_{10}(10^x\cdot 100^{x^3+1})=\log_{10} (10^x)+\log_{10}(100^{x^3+1}) $</span>
 </p>
<p>Then because <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$10^2$</span>
, we have:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;x+\log_{10}(10^{2(x^3+1)}) &amp;= x+2(x^3+1)\\&#10;&amp;=2x^3+x+2&#10;\end{align}$</span></p>

<h3 id='concept_182'>8.4.2. Logarithms of Powers</h3>

power of a quantity is <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>

<h3>The Power Rule for Logarithms</h3>

<p>We have already seen that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log _b \left( {xy} \right) = \log _b \left( x \right) + \log _b \left( y \right)$</span></p>
<p>If we apply this rule repeatedly we can devise another rule for simplifying expressions of the form <span class='clFormula'>$\log_b x^p$</span>
. </p>
<p>Recall that <span class='clFormula'>$x^p$</span>
 can be thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$x \cdot x \cdot x \cdots x$</span>
 where there are <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
 factors of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. Then we have:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\log_b(x^p) &amp;= \log_b (x \cdot x \cdots x) \\&#10;&amp;= \log_b x + \log_b x + \cdots +\log_b x \\&#10;&amp;= p\log_b x&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Since the <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
 factors of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 are converted to <span class='clFormula'>$p $</span>
 summands by the product rule formula.  </p>

<h3>Example 1: Simplify the expression <span class='clFormula'>$\log_3(3^x\cdot 9x^{100})$</span></h3>

<p>First expand the log:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_3(3^x\cdot 9x^{100}) =\log_3 (3^x) + \log_3 9 + \log_3(x^{100}) $</span>
 </p>
<p>Next use the product and power rule to simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_3 (3^x) + \log_3 9 + \log_3 (x^{100})= x+2+100\log_3 x$</div>


<h3>Example 2: Solve <span class='clFormula'>$2^{(x+1)}=10^3$</span>
 for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 using logarithms</h3>

<p>Start by taking the logarithm with base <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 of both sides:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\log_2 (2^{(x+1)}) &amp;= \log_2 (10^3)\\&#10;x+1&amp;=3\log_2(10)\\&#10;x&amp;=3\log_2(10)-1&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Therefore a solution would be <span class='clFormula'>$x=3\log_2(10) -1. $</span></p>

<h3 id='concept_183'>8.4.3. Logarithms of Quotients</h3>

<blockquote>The logarithm of the ratio of two quantities is the difference of the logarithms of the quantities. In symbols, <span class='clFormula'>$\log_b\left( \frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_bx - \log_by.$</span>
 </blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Relate the quotient rule for logarithms to the rules for operating with exponents, and use this rule to rewrite logarithms of quotients</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number.</li>
<li>The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>exponent</dt>
<dd>The power to which a number, symbol, or expression is to be raised. For example, the 3 in <equation>$x^3$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>We have already seen that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_b(xy) = \log_bx + \log_by$</div>

<p>Similarly, the logarithm of the ratio of two quantities is the difference of the logarithms:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_b\left( \frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_bx - &#10;log_by.$</span>
 </p>
<p>We can show that this is true by the following example:</p>
<p>Let <span class='clFormula'>$u=\log_b x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$v=\log_b y$</span>
.</p>
<p> Then <span class='clFormula'>$b^u=x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b^v=y.$</span>
 </p>
<p>Then: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)&amp;=\log_b\left({b^u \over b^v}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \log_b(b^{u-v}) \\&#10;&amp;=u-v\\ &#10;&amp;= \log_b x - \log_b y&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Another way to show that this rule is true, is to apply both the power and product rules and the fact that dividing by <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 is the same is multiplying by <span class='clFormula'>$y^{-1}.$</span>
 So we can write:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)&amp;=\log_b(x\cdot y^{-1})\\&#10;&amp; = \log_bx + \log_b(y^{-1})\\&amp;&#10; = \log_bx -\log_by&#10;\end{align}$</span></p>

<h3>Example: write the expression <span class='clFormula'>$\log_2\left({x^4y^9 \over z^{100}}\right)$</span>
 in a simpler way </h3>

<p>By applying the product, power, and quotient rules, you could write this expression as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_2(x^4)+\log_2(y^9)-\log_2(z^{100}) = 4\log_2x+9\log_2y-100\log_2z.$</div>


<h3 id='concept_178'>8.4.4. Changing Logarithmic Bases</h3>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the change of base formula to convert logarithms to different bases</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The base of a logarithm can be changed by expressing it as the quotient of two logarithms with a common base.</li>
<li>Changing a logarithm's base to <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>

</dl>

<p>Most common scientific calculators have a key for computing logarithms with base <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, but do not have keys for other bases. So, if you needed to get an approximation to a number like <span class='clFormula'>$\log_4(9)$</span>
 it can be difficult to do so. One could easily guess that it is between <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 since <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
 is between <span class='clFormula'>$4^1$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$4^2$</span>
, but it is difficult to get an accurate approximation. Fortunately, there is a change of base formula that can help.</p>

<h3>Change of Base Formula</h3>

<p>The change of base formula for logarithms is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_a(x)=\frac{\log_b(x)}{\log_b(a)}$</div>

<p>Thus, for example, we could calculate that <span class='clFormula'>$\log_4(9)=\frac{\log_{10}(9)}{\log_{10}(4)}$</span>
 which could be computed on almost any handheld calculator. </p>

<h3>Deriving the Formula</h3>

<p>To see why the formula is true, give <span class='clFormula'>$\log_a(x)$</span>
 a name like <span class='clFormula'>$z$</span>
:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;z=\log_a(x)$</span>
 </p>
<p>Write this as <span class='clFormula'>$a^z=x$</span></p>
<p> Now take the logarithm with base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 of both sides, yielding:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_b a^z = \log_bx$</span>
 </p>
<p>Using the power rule gives:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;z \cdot \log_ba = \log_b x$</span></p>
<p>Dividing both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$\log_ba$</span>
 gives:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;z={\log_b x \over \log_ba}.$</span></p>
<p>Thus we have <span class='clFormula'>$\log_a x ={\log_b x \over \log_b a}. $</span></p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>An expression of the form <span class='clFormula'>$\log_5(10^{x^2+1})$</span>

<h3>The Number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span></h3>

<p>The number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
, sometimes called the natural number, or Euler's number, is an important mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. When used as the base for a logarithm, the corresponding logarithm is called the natural logarithm, and is written as <span class='clFormula'>$\ln (x)$</span>
. Note that  <span class='clFormula'>$\ln (e) =1$</span>
and that <span class='clFormula'>$\ln (1)=0$</span>
.</p>
<p>There are a number of different definitions of the number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. Most of them involve calculus. One is that <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
 is the limit of the sequence whose general term is <span class='clFormula'>$(1+{1 \over n})^n$</span>
. Another is that <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
 is the unique number so that the area under the curve <span class='clFormula'>$y=1/x$</span>
 from <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
 to <span class='clFormula'>$x=e$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 square unit. </p>
<p>Another definition of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
 involves the infinite series <span class='clFormula'>$1+\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}+\frac{1}{3!}+\frac{1}{4! }+....$</span>
. It can be shown that the sum of this series is <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Importance of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span></h3>

<p> The number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is very important in mathematics, alongside <span class='clFormula'>$0, 1, i, \, \text{and} \, \pi.$</span>
 All five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics, and are the five constants appearing in the formulation of Euler's identity, which (amazingly) states that <span class='clFormula'>$e^{i\pi}+1=0.$</span>
Like the constant <span class='clFormula'>$\pi$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is irrational (it cannot be written as a  ratio of integers), and it is transcendental (it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients).</p>

<h3>Compound Interest</h3>

<p>One of the many places the number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
 plays a role in mathematics is in the formula for compound interest. Jacob Bernoulli discovered this constant by asking questions related to the amount of money in an account after a certain number of years, if the interest is compounded <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 times per year. He was able to come up with the formula that if the interest rate is <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
 percent and is calculated <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 times per year, and the account originally contained <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
 dollars, then the amount in the account after <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
 years is given by <span class='clFormula'>$A=P(1+{r \over n})^{nt}.$</span>
 By then asking about what happens as  <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 gets arbitrarily large, he was able to come up with the formula for continuously compounded interest, which is <span class='clFormula'>$A=Pe^{rt}.$</span></p>

<h3>Overview of <span class='clFormula'>$e^{x}$</span></h3>

<p>The basic exponential function, sometimes referred to as the exponential function, is <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=e^{x}$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is the number (approximately 2.718281828) described previously. Its graph lies between the graphs of <span class='clFormula'>$2^x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$3^x$</span>
. The graph's <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept is the point <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
, and it also contains the point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,e).$</span>

<p>The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=e^{x}$</span>
is upward-sloping, and increases faster as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
increases. The graph always lies above the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, but gets arbitrarily close to it for negative <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
; thus, the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis is a horizontal asymptote. The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$e^x$</span>
 has the property that the slope of the tangent line to the graph at each point is equal to its <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate at that point. <span class='clFormula'>$y=e^x$</span>
 is the only function with this property.</p>

<h3>A Model For Proportional Change</h3>

<p>The exponential function is used to model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (i.e., percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. If the change is positive, this is called exponential growth and if it is negative, it is called exponential decay.  For example, because a radioactive substance decays at a rate proportional to the amount of the substance present, the amount of the substance present at a given time can be modeled with an exponential function. Also, because the the growth rate of a population of bacteria in a petri dish is proportional to its size, the number of bacteria in the dish at a given time can be modeled by an exponential function such as <span class='clFormula'>$y=Ae^{kt}$</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
 is the number of bacteria present initially (at time <span class='clFormula'>$t=0$</span>
) and <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
 is a constant called the growth constant. </p>

<h3>The Natural Logarithm</h3>

<p>The logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, has to be raised to produce that number. The natural logarithm is the logarithm with base equal to <em>e</em>.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\log_e (x) = \ln(x)$</div>

<p>The natural logarithm can be written as <span class='clFormula'>$\log_e x$</span>
 but is usually written as <span class='clFormula'>$\ln x$</span>
. The two letters l and n are reversed from the order in English because it arises from the French (logarithm naturalle). </p>
<p>Just as the exponential function with base <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
 arises naturally in many calculus contexts, the natural logarithm, which is the inverse function of the exponential with base <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
, also arises in naturally in many contexts. It is used much more frequently in physics, chemistry, and higher mathematics than other logarithmic functions. For example, the doubling time for a population which is growing exponentially is usually given as <span class='clFormula'>${\ln 2 \over k}$</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
 is the growth rate, and the half-life of a radioactive substance is usually given as <span class='clFormula'>${\ln 2 \over \lambda}$</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$\lambda$</span>
 is the decay constant. </p>

<h3>Graphing <span class='clFormula'>$y=\ln(x)$</span></h3>

<p>The function slowly grows to positive infinity as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
increases and rapidly goes to negative infinity as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
approaches <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
("slowly" and "rapidly" as compared to any power law of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
). The <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis is an asymptote. The graph of the natural logarithm lies between that of <span class='clFormula'>$y=\log_2 x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y=\log_3 x$</span>
. Its value at <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, while its value at <span class='clFormula'>$x=e$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Solving Equations Using <span class='clFormula'>$\ln(x)$</span></h3>

<p>The natural logarithm function can be used to solve equations in which the variable is in an exponent. </p>

<h3>Example: Find the positive root of the equation <span class='clFormula'>$3^{x^2-1}=8$</span>
 </h3>

<p>The first step is to take the natural logarithm of both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\ln (3^{x^2-1}) = \ln 8$</div>

<p>Using the power rule of logarithms it can then be written as:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(x^2-1) \ln 3 = \ln 8$</span></p>
<p>Dividing both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$\ln(3)$</span>
 gives:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x^2-1={\ln 8 \over \ln 3}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Thus the positive solution is <span class='clFormula'>$x=\sqrt{{\ln 8 \over \ln 3} + 1}.$</span>
 This can be calculated (approximately) with any scientific handheld calculator. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Population growth can be modeled by an exponential equation. Namely, it is given by the formula <span class='clFormula'>$P(r, t, f)=P_i(1+r)^\frac{t}{f}$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$P{_i}$</span>
represents the initial population, <em>r</em> is the rate of population growth (expressed as a decimal), <em>t</em> is elapsed time, and <em>f</em> is the period over which time population grows by a rate of <em>r</em>. The ratio of <em>t</em> to <em>f</em> is often simplified into one value representing the number of compounding cycles.</p>
<p>The rate <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
by which the population is growing is itself a function of four variables. These are births (<span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
), deaths (<span class='clFormula'>$D$</span>
), immigrants (<span class='clFormula'>$I$</span>
) and emigrants (<span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
). Specifically, the rate is given by:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>${\Delta}P=(B-D)+(I-E)$</span>
 </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>${\Delta}P$</span>
denotes the change in population. The formula is split into natural growth which accounts for births and deaths (<span class='clFormula'>$B-D$</span>
) and mechanical growth which accounts for people moving into and out of a particular region (<span class='clFormula'>$I-E$</span>
).</p>

<h3>Population Growth Rate</h3>

<p>The population size can fluctuate from growth to decline, and back again. As such, another variable is important when studying population demographics and dynamics. It is the Population Growth Rate (<span class='clFormula'>$PGR$</span>
).</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$PGR$</span>
is the rate of change in population over a certain span of time: <span class='clFormula'>$t_2-t_1$</span>
. It can be determined using the formula:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;PGR=\frac{ln(P(t_2))-ln(P(t_1))}{(t_2-t_1)}$</span></p>
<p>If we multiply the <span class='clFormula'>$PGR$</span>
by <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
we arrive at the percentage growth relative to the population at the beginning of the time period. </p>
<p>A positive growth rate indicates an increasing population size, while a negative growth rate is characteristic of a decreasing population. A growth rate of <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
means stagnation in population size.</p>

<h3>World Population</h3>

<p>In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living. As of March 2016, it was estimated at 7.4 billion, an all-time high. The United Nations estimates it will further increase to 11.2 billion in the year 2100. If the current rates of births and deaths hold, the world population growth can be modeled using an exponential function. The graph below shows an exponential model for the growth of the world population. </p>



<a href='../images/0819.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0819.png' alt='World-Population from 1800 (actual) to 2100 (projected)'></a>

<h3 id='concept_188'>8.6.2. Limited Growth</h3>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use logistic functions to represent limited growth</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Exponential growth may exist within known parameters, but such a functionality may not continue indefinitely in the real world.</li>
<li>If a natural maximum is conceivable, the logistic growth model can be used to represent growth. It has the form: <span class='clFormula'>$P(t)=\frac{c}{1+a\cdot e^{-bt}}$</span>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Exponential functions can be used to model growth and decay. For example, the world's human population is growing exponentially as can be seen in the following graph.</p>



<a href='../images/0820.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0820.png' alt='World Population from 1800 AD to 2100 AD'></a>

<div><b><i>World Population from 1800 AD to 2100 AD</i></b></div>
<p>Three projections for the world's population are shown, with a low estimate reaching a peak and then decreasing, a medium estimate increasing but at an ever-slower rate, and a high estimate continuing to increase exponentially.</p>

<p>There is, however, a limit to how accurate a model such as this can be. Even if we account for varying rates of growth, the idea that human population can be modeled strictly with an exponential function is misguided. Exponential functions are ever-increasing so saying that an exponential function models population growth exactly means that the human population will grow without bound. That is not sound reasoning, as the human population is affected by various factors among these are access to resources such as food, water, and shelter. At some point in the future, the number of humans will grow so large that there will not be enough resources to sustain growth. Thus the exponential model, while perhaps useful in the short-term, is not accurate in the long-term for real world simulation. At some point the growth must level off. This is the idea behind limited growth,  that a population may grow exponentially but only to a point at which time the growth will taper off.</p>
<p>As an alternative, consider a farm upon which a population of sheep are kept in a constant, comfortable climate in a fully enclosed field. Assume the entire system is closed from gains and losses, but for a flow of a stream of clean drinking water through the field.</p>
<p>With no predators, the population of sheep would perfectly fit an exponential model to a certain point when the availability of food would act as a limiting factor. If the amount of grass available to the sheep and its rate of replenishing are constant, eventually the population of sheep will grow to a tipping point at which there is no longer enough grass to feed the sheep. The death rate of sheep will increase as some starve. Thus, the model of population growth among sheep will no longer be exponential.</p>

<h3>Logistic Growth Model</h3>

<p>To account for limitations in growth, the logistic growth model can be used. The logistic growth model is given by <span class='clFormula'>$P(t)=\frac{c}{1+a\cdot e^{-bt}}$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
represents the present population, <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is the carrying capacity (the maximum the population approaches as time approaches infinity), <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is the population growth rate, <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
is time, and <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is the difference between carrying capacity and initial population.</p>

<h3>Evaluating a Logistic Growth Function</h3>

<p>Given various conditions, it is possible to evaluate a logistic function for a particular value of <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
. That is, it is possible to determine the population at time <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
, given values for <span class='clFormula'>$c,a,b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 1: Evaluate the logistic growth function <span class='clFormula'>$P(t)=\frac{50}{1+8\cdot e^{-3t}}$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$t=6$</span></h3>

<p>To evaluate this function we plug <span class='clFormula'>$6$</span>
into the equation in place of <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
as follows.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;P(6)&amp;=\frac{50}{1+8\cdot e^{(-3)(6)}}\\&amp;&#10;\approx49.99999391&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<h3>Graphing a Logistic Growth Model</h3>

<p>Graphically, the logistic function resembles an exponential function followed by a logarithmic function that approaches a horizontal asymptote. This horizontal asymptote represents the carrying capacity. That is, <span class='clFormula'>$y=c$</span>
is a horizontal asymptote of the graph. Additionally, <span class='clFormula'>$y=o$</span>
is also a horizontal asymptote. From the left, it grows rapidly, but that growth is dampened as time passes to where it reaches a maximum. The function's domain is the set of all real numbers, whereas its range is <span class='clFormula'>$0&lt;y&lt;c$</span>
. Below is the graph of a logistic function.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, compound interest is an application of exponential functions that is found very commonly in every day life. Interest is, generally, a fee charged for the borrowing of money. The two classic cases are (1) interest accrued as part of loan and (2) interest accrued in a savings or other account. In the first case the client owes the amount borrowed plus the interest. In the second, the bank pays the client interest for maintaining money in the account. If you are the client, you are losing money in the first case and earning money in the second.</p>
<p>The amount of interest accrued depends on the principal (amount borrowed/deposited), the interest rate (a percentage of the principal), period (amount of time between interest payments) and time elapsed.</p>
<p>For questions of interest, unless otherwise stated, the amount borrowed/deposited remains unchanged. The client does not, for example, add or withdraw funds from the savings account after the initial deposit (the principal) is made.</p>

<h3>Simple vs. Compound Interest</h3>

<p>There exist two kinds of interest: simple and compound. </p>
<p>In simple interest, interest is accrued on the principal alone. This means that the amount of interest earned in each compounding period is the same because interest is earned based on the principal which remains unchanged.  </p>
<p>In compound interest, interest is accrued on both the principal and on prior interest earned. For this reason, if all other conditions are the same (principal, rate, time elapsed and frequency of interest payments) compound interest grows at a faster rate than simple interest. The amount of interest earned increases with each compounding period.</p>

<h3>Simple Interest: An Example</h3>

<p>Simple interest is accrued linearly based on the formula: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;I=p\cdot r \cdot \frac{t}{f}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$I$</span>
represents the interest, <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
is the principal, <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is interest rate (expressed as a decimal), <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
is time elapsed, and <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is the time elapsed per interest payment. The ratio of <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is often simplified to the number of interest payments. Total amount owed/earned which includes the principal and the interest is given by <span class='clFormula'>$A=P+I$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 1: You deposit \$100 into a bank account earning 5% annual interest. How much money is in the account at the end of 1, 2, 3, 4, and  <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
years?</h3>

<p>Let us begin by determining the interest at the end of the first year. We use the formula <span class='clFormula'>$I=p\cdot r \cdot \frac{t}{f}$</span>
with <span class='clFormula'>$p=100$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$r=.05$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$t=1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$f=1$</span>
. The interest earned at the end of the year is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;I&amp;=(100)(.05)(\frac{1}{1})\\&amp;&#10;=5&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The amount in the account at the conclusion of the year is given by <span class='clFormula'>$100+5=105$</span>
. It is useful to note that the account will earn \$<span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
in interest every single year irrespective of how long the money is in the account or what the amount in the account is during any given year. This can be seen by the fact that the amount after <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
years is given by a linear function with slope equal to five (see table below).</p>
<p>The table below shows the calculations, interest earned and total amount in the account after 1, 2, 3, 4, and n years.</p>

<div><b><i>Calculations of interest earned and amount in the account for Example 1</i></b></div>
<p></p>


<h3>Compound Interest: An Example</h3>

<p>Compound interest is not linear, but exponential in form. That is, the amount of interest earned is not constant but instead changes with time based on the total amount of the amount in the account.</p>
<p>The equation representing investment value as a function of principal, interest rate, period and time is: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;M=p(1+r)^\frac{t}{f}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$M$</span>
represents the total value (including principal), <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
represents principal, <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is interest rate (expressed as a decimal), <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
is time elapsed, and <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is the length of time between payments. To calculate interest alone, simply subtract the principal from <span class='clFormula'>$M$</span>
.</p>
<p>We now re-consider Example 1 above. This time we use compound interest instead.</p>

<h3>Example
2: You deposit \$100 into a bank account earning 5% interest compounded annually. How
much money is in the account at the end of 1, 2, 3, 4, and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
years?</h3>

<p>Let us begin by determining the amount in the account after the first year  using the formula <span class='clFormula'>$M=p(1+r)^\frac{t}{f}$</span>
with <span class='clFormula'>$p=100$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$r=.05$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$t=1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$f=1$</span>
. The amount in the account after one year is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;M&amp;=(100)(1+.05)^\frac{1}{1}\\&#10;&amp;=105&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>This is the exact amount that was in the account after the first year using simple interest. That is because the difference is that compound interest earns interest on both the principal and prior interest. At the end of the first year there was no prior interest in the account. We will see differences between simple and compound interest in this, and similar problems, in the second year.</p>
<p>Let us determine the amount in the account after the second year again using the formula <span class='clFormula'>$M=p(1+r)^\frac{t}{f}$</span>
but now letting <span class='clFormula'>$t=2$</span>
. We obtain:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;M&amp;=100(1+.05)^\frac{2}{1}\\&#10;&amp;=110.25&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>That is, there are <span class='clFormula'>$25$</span>
cents more in account in the second year using compound interest instead of simple interest. This might not seem like a lot but the amount of interest earned will continue to increase each year as there is more and more money in the account. Every year the interest earned will be higher than in the previous year, whereas in simple interest the amount each year is fixed.</p>
<p>The following table includes the calculations, interest earned and total amount in the account at the end of <span class='clFormula'>$1,2,3,4$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
years.</p>



<a href='../images/0823.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0823.png' alt='Calculations of interest earned and amount in the account for Example 2'></a>

<div><b><i>Calculations of interest earned and amount in the account for Example 2</i></b></div>
<p></p>

<p>The amount in the account is greater each year beginning with year two when using compound interest rather than simple interest. However, because the principal is so small and the number of years elapsed only 4, it does not appear that the difference between the two example is that great. Let us consider one last problem where we let the time elapsed be much greater.</p>

<h3>Simple vs. Compound Interest Over Time: An Example</h3>

<p>The biggest differences between the amount of money in an account using simple versus compound interest are seen over extended periods of time. To highlight this, we return the the examples we did prior and now consider how much money is in each account after 50 years.</p>

<h3>Example
3: You deposit \$100 into a bank account earning 5% interest compounded annually. How
much money is in the account at the end of 50 years? How does this compare to the amount in the account after 50 years if the interest had been compounded annually?</h3>

<p>The money in the account using simple interest after <span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
years is given by</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;P+I&amp;=100+(100)(.05)(\frac{50}{1})\\&#10;&amp;=350&#10;\end{align}$</span></p>
<p>However, the amount in the account using compound interest after <span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
years is given by: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;M&amp;=(100)(1+.05)^\frac{50}{1}\\&#10;&amp;=1146.74&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>A difference of \$<span class='clFormula'>$796.74$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Frequency of Compounding Periods</h3>

<p>The more frequent the compounding periods the more interest is accrued. Therefore, if one deposits money into a bank account that earns compound interest, and does not add or withdraw any additional funds, the amount of money in the bank would increase as the number of compounding periods per year increases. You earn more interest when interest is compounded quarterly (<span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
times a year) than once a year. You earn more interest when interest is compounded monthly (<span class='clFormula'>$12$</span>
times a year) than quarterly. You earn more interest when interest is compounded daily (<span class='clFormula'>$365$</span>
times a year) than monthly and so on. You earn the most interest when interest is compounded continuously. </p>



<a href='../images/0824.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0824.png' alt='Graph of interest accrued under differing number of compounding periods per year '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of interest accrued under differing number of compounding periods per year </i></b></div>
<p>Starting with a principal of \$1000, interest rises exponentially. The graph shows that the more frequent the number of compounding periods the more interest is accrued and shows this visually for yearly, quarterly, monthly and continuous compounding.</p>


<h3>Interest Compounded Continuously</h3>

<p>Given that the more frequent the compounding periods per year, the more interest is accrued it might come as a surprise that money deposited into a bank account accrues compound interest continuously. You might expect the bank would choose a smaller number of compounding periods in order to pay out less in interest, but this is not the case. To see why let us take the following example: You deposit \$<span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
in the bank in an account earning <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
% interest. You do not add or withdraw money from the account. In this situation the amount of money in the account will be given by <span class='clFormula'>$(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is the number of compounding periods and <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{n}$</span>
is the rate per compounding period. This is a simplification of the prior formula used because of the specific conditions of this most recent situation. We expect that as <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
increases the amount in the account also increases, but if the amount grows without bounds then banks would be giving away much money as they compound interest continuously. </p>
<p>The following table shows the amount in the account at the end of one year when interest is compounded with differing frequencies.</p>



<a href='../images/0825.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0825.png' alt='Amount in account after 1 year with interest compounded at different frequencies'></a>

<div><b><i>Amount in account after 1 year with interest compounded at different frequencies</i></b></div>
<p></p>

<p>What we see from the table is that while the interest earned increases as the number of compounding periods increase, that the rate at which it increases is slowing down. Going from <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
compounding periods yields an increase of <span class='clFormula'>$44$</span>
cents but going from <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$1000$</span>
barely raises the interest <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
cent. Another way of saying this is that the amount in the account is approaching a limiting value. The numbers in the table are getting closer and closer to the number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. The number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is  used as the base of the natural logarithm and is equal to approximately <span class='clFormula'>$2.718281828$</span>
. No matter how long the money is in the account, it will not grow beyond that value.</p>
<p>The formula for compound interest with the number of compounding periods going to infinity yields the formula for compounding continuously. It should come as no surprise that this formula involves the number <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
.</p>
<p>The formula for the amount of money in an account where interest is compounded continuously is given by <span class='clFormula'>$A=Pe^{rt}$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
is the principal, <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is the annual rate written as a decimal and <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
is the time in years.</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Exponential decrease can be modeled as: <span class='clFormula'>$N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$N$</span>
is the quantity, <span class='clFormula'>$N_0$</span>

is half-life.</li>
<li>Half-life can be inserted into the exponential decay model as such: <span class='clFormula'>$N(t)=N_0(\frac{1}{2})^{t/t_{1/2}}$</span>

</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Just as it is possible for a variable to grow exponentially as a function of another, so can the a variable decrease exponentially. Consider the decrease of a population that occurs at a rate proportional to its value. This rate at which the population is decreasing remains constant but as the population is continually decreasing the overall decline becomes less and less steep.</p>
<p>Exponential rate of change can be modeled algebraically by the following formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$N$</span>
is the quantity, <span class='clFormula'>$N{_0}$</span>
is the initial quantity, <span class='clFormula'>$\lambda$</span>
is the decay constant, and <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
is time. The decay constant is indeed a constant, but the form of the equation (the negative exponent of <em>e</em>) results in an ever-changing rate of decline.</p>

<h3>Half Life</h3>

<p>The time it takes for a substance (drug, radioactive nuclide, or other)
to lose half of its pharmacological, physiological, biological, or
radiological activity is called its half-life. The exponential decay of the substance is a time-dependent decline and a prime example of exponential decay.</p>
<p>As an example let us assume we have a <span class='clFormula'>$100$</span>
pounds of a substance with a half-life of <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
years. Then in <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
years half the amount (<span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
pounds) remains. In another <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
years there will be <span class='clFormula'>$25$</span>
pounds remaining. In another <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 years, or  <span class='clFormula'>$15$</span>
years from the beginning, there will be <span class='clFormula'>$12.5$</span>
. The amount by which the substance decreases, is itself slowly decreasing.</p>

<h3>Use of Half Life in Carbon Dating</h3>

<p>Half-life is very useful in determining the age of historical artifacts through a process known as carbon dating. Given a sample of carbon in an ancient, preserved piece of flesh, the age of the sample can be determined based on the percentage of radioactive carbon-13 remaining. 1.1% of carbon is C-13 and it decays to carbon-12.  C-13 has a half-life of 5700 years—that is, in 5700 years, half of a sample of C-13 will have converted to C-12, which represents approximately all the remaining carbon. Using this information it is possible to determine the age of the artifact given the amount of C-13 it presently contains, and comparing it to the amount of C-13 it should contain.</p>
<p>Half-life can be mathematically defined as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{\lambda }$</div>

<p>It can also be conveniently inserted into the exponential decay formula as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;N(t)=N_0(\frac{1}{2})^{t/t_{1/2}}$</div>

<p>Thus, if a sample is found to contain 0.55% of its carbon as C-13 (exactly half of the usual 1.1%), it can be calculated that the sample has undergone exactly one half-life, and is thus 5,700 years old.</p>
<p>Below is a graph highlighting exponential decay of a radioactive substance. Using the graph, find that half-life. </p>



<a href='../images/0826.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0826.png' alt='Graph depicting radioactive decay'></a>

<div><b><i>Graph depicting radioactive decay</i></b></div>
<p>The amount of a substance undergoing radioactive decay decreases exponentially, eventually reaching zero. Since there is 50% of the substance left after 1 year, the half-life is 1 year.  </p>
