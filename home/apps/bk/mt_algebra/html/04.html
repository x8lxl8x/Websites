<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>In mathematics, a <em>function</em> is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs. Functions have the property that each input is related to exactly one output. For example, in the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 any input for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 will give one output only.</p>
<p>Functions are typically named with a single letter, like <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
. <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is read "<span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
", and represents the output of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
corresponding to an input <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.
The input variable(s) are sometimes referred to as the argument(s) of the function. Consider the following example:</p>
<p>Let <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span></p>
<p>Let <span class='clFormula'>$x=-3$</span>
, then:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(-3)=(-3)^2&#10;$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;&#10;=9$</div>

<p>In the example above, the argument is <span class='clFormula'>$x=-3$</span>
 and the output is <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
. We write the function as:<span class='clFormula'>$f(-3)=9$</span>
. </p>
<p>In the case of a function with just one input variable, the input and output of the function can be expressed as an ordered pair. The order is such that the first element is the argument and the second is the output. In the example above, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
, we have the ordered pair <span class='clFormula'>$(-3, 9)$</span>
. If both the input and output are real numbers then the ordered pair can be viewed as the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the graph of the function.</p>
<p>Another commonly used notation for a function is <span class='clFormula'>$f:X\rightarrow Y$</span>
, which reads as saying that <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is a function that maps values from the set <span class='clFormula'>$X$</span>
onto values of the set <span class='clFormula'>$Y$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Functions as a Machine</h3>

<p>Functions are often described as a machine in a box that is open on two ends. You put something into one end of the box, it gets changed inside of the box, and then the result pops out the other end. The function is the machine inside the box and it's defined by what it does to whatever you put into it.</p>



<a href='../images/0401.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0401.png' alt='Function Machine'></a>

<div><b><i>Function Machine</i></b></div>
<p>A function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
takes an input <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and returns an output <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
. One metaphor describes the function as a "machine", that for each input returns a corresponding output.</p>

<p>Let's say the machine has a blade that slices whatever you put in into two and sends one half of that object out the other end. If you put in a banana you would get back half a banana. If you put in an apple you would get back half an apple.</p>



<a href='../images/0402.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0402.png' alt='Fruit Halving Function'></a>

<div><b><i>Fruit Halving Function</i></b></div>
<p>This shows a function that takes a fruit as input and releases half the fruit as output.</p>

<p>Let's define the function to take what you put into it and cut it in half. That is, the function divides the input by two. If you put in <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
you would get back <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. If you put in <span class='clFormula'>$57$</span>
 you would get back <span class='clFormula'>$28.5$</span>
. The function machine allows us to alter expressions. In this example, the function would be written as: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Functions As a Relation</h3>

<p>Functions can also be thought of as a subset of relations. A <em>relation </em>is a connection between values in one set and values in another. In other words, each number you put in is associated with each number you get out. In a function every input number is associated with exactly one output number In a relation an input number may be associated with multiple or no output numbers. This is an important fact about functions that cannot be stressed enough: every possible input to the function must have one and only one output. All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.</p>

<h3 id='concept_99'>4.1.2. Graphical Representations of Functions</h3>

<blockquote>Graphs provide a visual representation of functions, showing the relationship between the input values and output values. </blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the relationship between graphs of equations and graphs of functions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Functions have an independent variable and a dependent variable. Typically <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is the independent variable and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
the dependent variable.</li>
<li>As you choose any valid value for the independent variable, the dependent variable is determined by the function.</li>
<li>To graph a function, choose some values for the independent variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, plug them into the function to get a set of ordered pairs <span class='clFormula'>$(x,f(x))$</span>
, and plot these on the graph. Then connect the points to best match how the points are arranged on the graph. Make sure you have enough points.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>independent variable</dt>
<dd>An independent variable in an equation or function is one whose value is not dependent on any other in the equation or function.</dd>
<dt>dependent variable</dt>
<dd>The dependant variable in an equation or function is that whose value depends on one or more independant variables in the equation or function.</dd>
<dt>graph</dt>
<dd>A diagram displaying data; in particular one showing the relationship between two or more quantities, measurements, or numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Independent and Dependent Variables in Function Notation</h3>

<p>Functions have an independent variable and a dependent variable. When we look at a function such as <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x$</span>
, we call the variable that we are changing, in this case <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, the independent variable. We assign the value of the function to a variable, in this case <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, that we call the dependent variable.  Function notation, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is read as "<span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
 of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
" which means "the value of the function at <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
."  Since the output, or dependent variable is <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, for function notation often times <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.  The ordered pairs normally stated in linear equations as <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
, in function notation are now written as <span class='clFormula'>$(x,f(x))$</span>
.</p>
<p>We say that <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is independent because we can pick any value for which the function is defined, in this case the set of real numbers <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
, as inputs into the function. We say the result is assigned to the dependent variable since it depends on what value we placed into the function.</p>

<h3>Graphing Functions</h3>

<p>Example 1:  Let's start with a simple linear function: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)=5-\frac{5}{2}x$</span>
.</p>
<p>Start by graphing as if <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is a linear equation: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=5-\frac{5}{2}x$</span>
 </p>
<p>We choose a few values for the independent variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.  Let's choose a negative value, zero, and a positive value: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x=-2, 0, 2 $</span>
. </p>
<p>Next, substitute these values into the function for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 (which means the same as the dependent variable <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
):  we get the ordered pairs: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(-2,10), (0,5), (2,0)$</span>
 </p>
<p>This function is that of a line, since the highest exponent in the function is a <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, so simply connect the three points. Extend them in either direction past the points to infinity, and we have our graph.</p>



<a href='../images/0403.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0403.png' alt='Line graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Line graph</i></b></div>
<p>This is the graph of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=5-\frac{5}{2}x$</span>
.  The function is linear, since the highest degree in the function is a <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.  Only two points are required to graph a linear function.</p>

<p>Example 2:  Graph the function: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)=x^{3}-9x$</span>
.</p>
<p>Start by choosing values for the independent variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. This function is more complicated than that of a line so we'll need to choose  more points. Let us choose:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x=\{0, \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \pm4\}$</span>
.</p>
<p>Next, plug these values into the function, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{3}-9x$</span>
, to get a set of ordered pairs, in this case we get the set of ordered pairs:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\{(-4, -28),(-3,0)(-2,10),(-1,8),(0,0),(1,-8),(2,-10),(3,0),(4,28)\}$</span>
.</p>
<p>Next place these points on the graph, and connect them as best as possible with a curve. The graph for this function is below.</p>



<a href='../images/0404.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0404.png' alt='Cubic graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Cubic graph</i></b></div>
<p>Graph of the cubic function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{3}-9x$</span>
.  The degree of the function is 3, therefore it is a cubic function.</p>

<h3 id='concept_380'>4.1.3. The Vertical Line Test</h3>

<blockquote>The vertical line test is used to determine whether a curve on an <span class='clFormula'>$xy$</span>
-plane is a function</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain why the vertical line test shows, graphically, whether or not a curve is a function</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A function can only have one output, <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, for each unique input, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. If any <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value in a curve is associated with more than one <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value, then the curve does not represent a function. </li>
<li>If a vertical line intersects a curve on an <span class='clFormula'>$xy$</span>
-plane more than once, then for one value of <em>x</em> the curve has more than one value of <em>y</em>, and the curve does not represent a function. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>function</dt>
<dd>A relation in which each element of the input is associated with exactly one element of the output.</dd>
<dt>vertical line test</dt>
<dd>A visual test that determines whether a curve is a function or not by examining the number of <equation>$y$</equation>-values associated with each <equation>$x$</equation>-value that lies on the curve.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In mathematics, the vertical line test is a visual way to determine if a curve is a graph of a function, or not. Recall that a function can only have one output, <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, for each unique input, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. If any <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value in a curve is associated with more than one <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value, then the curve does not represent a function. </p>
<p>If a vertical line intersects a curve on an <span class='clFormula'>$xy$</span>
-plane more than once, then for one value of <em>x</em> the curve has more than one value of <em>y</em>, and the curve does not represent a function. If all vertical lines
intersect a curve at most once then the curve represents a function.</p>



<a href='../images/0405.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0405.png' alt='Vertical Line Test'></a>

<div><b><i>Vertical Line Test</i></b></div>
<p>Note that in the top graph, a single vertical line drawn where the red dots are plotted would intersect the curve 3 times. Thus, it fails the vertical line test and does not represent a function. Any vertical line in the bottom graph passes through only once and hence passes the vertical line test, and thus represents a function.</p>



<p>To use the vertical line test, take a ruler or other straight edge and draw a line parallel to the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis for any chosen value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. If the vertical line you drew intersects the graph more than once for any value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
then the graph is not the graph of a function. If, alternatively, a
vertical line intersects the graph no more than once, no matter where
the vertical line is placed, then the graph is the graph of a function.
For example, a curve which is any straight line other than a vertical
line will be the graph of a function. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Refer to the three graphs below, <span class='clFormula'>$(a)$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$(b)$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$(c)$</span>
. Apply the vertical line test to determine which graphs represent functions.</p>



<a href='../images/0406.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0406.png' alt='Applying the Vertical Line Test'></a>

<div><b><i>Applying the Vertical Line Test</i></b></div>
<p>Which graphs represent functions?</p>

<p>If any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the relation
represented by the graph is not a function. Notice that any vertical
line would pass through only one point of the two graphs shown in graphs <span class='clFormula'>$(a)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(b)$</span>
.
From this we can conclude that these two graphs represent functions.
The third graph, <span class='clFormula'>$(c)$</span>
, does not represent a function because, at most <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values, a vertical line would intersect the graph at more than one point. This is shown in the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id='section_29'>4.2. Domain and Range</h2>

<h3 id='concept_100'>4.2.1. Introduction to Domain and Range</h3>

<blockquote>The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values that produce some output value range</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Define the domain and range of a function</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Given a function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
, the set <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 values (inputs) is the domain of <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
, and the set <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 values (outputs) is the range of <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
.</li>
<li>The domain of a function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is all of the values for which the function is defined. For instance, <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{x}$</span>
is not defined when <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
. Also, <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{x}$</span>
is not defined when <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is negative.</li>
<li>To find the domain of a function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
, you must find the values for which <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is not defined. So the domain for <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{x}$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$ x \geq 0$</span>
 .</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Is the Domain and Range of a Function?</h3>





<p>The <em>domain</em> of a function is the set of input values, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, for which a function is defined. The domain is shown in the left oval in the picture below. The function provides an output value, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
, for each member of the domain.  The set of values the function  outputs is termed the <em>range</em> of the function, and those values are shown in the right hand oval in the picture below.  A <em>function</em> is the relation that takes the inputs of the domain and output the values in the range. The rule for a function is that for each input there is exactly one output.  </p>



<a href='../images/0408.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0408.png' alt='Mapping of a Function'></a>

<div><b><i>Mapping of a Function</i></b></div>
<p>The oval on the left is the domain of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
, and the oval on the right is the range.  The green arrows show how each member of the domain is mapped to a particular value of the range.  </p>



<p>As you can see in the illustration, each value of the domain has a green arrow to exactly one value of the range.  Therefore this mapping is a function.  </p>
<p>We can also tell by the set of ordered pairs given in this mapping that it is a function because none of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values repeat:  <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,1),(1,1),(7,49),(0.5,0.25)$</span>
; since each input maps to exactly one output.  (Note that although the output value of <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 repeats, only the input values can not repeat)  </p>
<p>We can also tell this mapping, and set of ordered pairs is a function based on the graph of the ordered pairs because the points do not make a vertical line.  If an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
value were to repeat there would be two points making a graph of a vertical line, which would not be a function.  Let's look at this mapping and list of ordered pairs graphed on a Cartesian Plane.</p>



<a href='../images/0409.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0409.png' alt='Ordered pairs'></a>

<div><b><i>Ordered pairs</i></b></div>
<p>This mapping or set of ordered pairs is a function because the points do not make a vertical line.  This is called the vertical line test of a function.  It shows that for every input there is exactly one output value.</p>

<p>In addition, the domain of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{2}$</span>
is the set of all real numbers, <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
, as every real number you put into <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
will give an output, namely <span class='clFormula'>$ x^2$</span>
.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all functions have the set of real numbers as their domain. For instance, the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$</span>
is not defined for <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, because you cannot divide a number by <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. In this case, the domain of <span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
is the set of all real numbers <em>except</em> <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. That is, <span class='clFormula'>$x\neq0$</span>
. So the domain of this function is <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$</span>
.</p>
<p>What about the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$</span>
? In this case, the square root of a negative number is not defined, and so the domain is the set of all real numbers where <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq0$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Finding the Domain and Range: Given a Function</h3>

<p>In order to find the domain of a function, if it isn't stated to begin with, we need to look at the function definition to determine what values are not allowed. For instance, we know that you cannot take the square root of a negative number, and you cannot divide by <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. With this knowledge in hand, let's find the domain of a function.</p>
<p>Example 1:  Find the domain of:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x-1}-2}+x$</span>
 </p>
<p>First, we know we cannot divide by <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, so any value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
that causes a division by <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
is not allowed in the domain. In this example, this occurs when:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\sqrt{x-1}-2=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>Solving for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, this happens when <span class='clFormula'>$x=5$</span>
, so we know that <span class='clFormula'>$x\neq5$</span>
. </p>
<p>We also know we can't take the square root of a negative number. This means that:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x-1&gt;0 $</span>
 </p>

<h3>Review of Domain, Range, and Functions</h3>

<p>As stated in a previous section, the <em>domain</em> of a function is the set of 'input' values <span class='clFormula'>$(x)$</span>
 for which the function is defined.  The domain is part of the definition of a function.  For example, the domain of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = \sqrt{x} $</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq0$</span>
.</p>
<p>The <em>range</em> of a function is the set of results, solutions, or 'output' values <span class='clFormula'>$(y)$</span>
 to the equation for a given input.  By definition, a function only has one result for each domain.  For instance, the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{2}$</span>
has a range of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)\geq0$</span>
, because the square of a number always yields a positive result.</p>
<p>In taking both domain and range into account, a <em>function</em> is any mathematical formula that produces one and only one result for each input. Hence, every given domain value has one and only one range value as a result, but not necessarily vice versa. In other words, two different values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
can have the same <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value, but each <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value must be joined with a distinct <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value.  This makes sense since results can repeat (the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values), but inputs cannot (the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values).</p>

<h3>Determining Domain and Range </h3>

<p>The domain and range can be visualized using a graph, such as the graph for <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{2}$</span>
, shown below as a red U-shaped curve.  The blue N-shaped (inverted) curve is the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=-\frac{1}{12}x^3$</span>
.  </p>
<p>Example 1:  Determine the domain and range of each graph pictured below:</p>
<p>Both graphs include all real numbers <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 as input values, since both graphs continue to the left (negative values) and to the right (positive values) for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 (inputs).  The curves continue to infinity in both directions; therefore, we say the domain for  both graphs is the set of all real numbers, notated as:  <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
. </p>
<p>If we now look at the possible outputs or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
, (looking up and down the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, notice that the red graph does NOT include <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values that are negative, whereas the blue graph does include both positive and negative values.  Therefore, the range for the graph <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^{2}$</span>
, is <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
 except <span class='clFormula'>$y&lt; 0$</span>
, or simply stated: <span class='clFormula'>$y \geq 0$</span>
.  The range for the graph <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=-\frac{1}{12}x^3$</span>
, is <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Finding Domains of Rational Functions</h3>

<p>A <em>rational expression</em> is one which can be written as the ratio of two polynomial functions. Despite being called a rational expression, neither the coefficients of the polynomials nor the values taken by the function are necessarily rational numbers. In the case of one variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, an expression is called rational if and only if it can be written in the form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle &#10;\frac { P(x) }{ Q(x) }$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$P(x)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$Q(x)$</span>
are polynomial functions in <span class='clFormula'>$x $</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$Q(x)$</span>
is not the zero polynomial <span class='clFormula'>$(Q(x) \neq 0)$</span>
.</p>
<p>The <em>domain </em>of a rational expression of is the set of all points for which the denominator is not zero. If the denominator of the equation becomes equal to zero, the expression is undefined at that point.</p>

<h3>Example 1:  What is the domain of the rational function:</h3>

<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)= \frac { x^3-2x }{ 2(x^2-5) }$</span></p>
<p>To find the domain of a rational function, set the denominator equal to zero and solve.  All values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 except for those that satisfy <span class='clFormula'>$2(x^2-5)=0$</span>
 are the domain of the expression.
 </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle &#10;2(x^2-5)=0$</div>

<p>To solve, divide both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
, add <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 to both sides, and then take the square root of both sides to yield:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x=\pm \sqrt { 5 }$</span>
.  </p>
<p>Therefore the domain is the set of all real numbers except the square root of five or  negative square root of five.</p>
<p>Notice the graph of the function below.  At the values of <span class='clFormula'>$x=\pm \sqrt { 5 }$</span>
 (which is approximately <span class='clFormula'>$\pm 2.2$</span>
), the graph does not exist.</p>



<a href='../images/0412.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0412.png' alt='Rational function with restricted domain'></a>

<div><b><i>Rational function with restricted domain</i></b></div>
<p>The graph of the function: <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\displaystyle \frac { x^3-2x }{ 2(x^2-5) }$</span>
, where the domain is restricted at <span class='clFormula'>$x=\pm \sqrt { 5 }$</span>
 since the function does not exist at those points. The function has three parts; for x-values less than the negative square root of 5, it has an oblique asymptote and a vertical asymptote at the negative square root of 5, descending to negative infinity at the vertical asymptote. It is entirely in the third quadrant. For x-values between the negative and positive square root of five, the function looks similar to a cubic polynomial, but with vertical asymptotes at the boundaries given. It descends from positive infinity to negative infinity. For x-values greater than the square root of 5, the function again has a vertical asymptote at the square root of 5 and an oblique asymptote. It descends from positive infinity at the vertical asymptote then curves to follow the oblique asymptote to positive infinity. It is only in the first quadrant.</p>

<h3>Example 2:  What is the domain of the rational function: </h3>

<h3>
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)= \frac{\left(x^2-2\right)}{x}$</span>
 </h3>

<p>Algebraically, the domain is the set of all real numbers except zero, since the denominator can not equal zero. One way to determine this is to look at it graphically. We can see that the graph is discontinuous at <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, indicating that the domain is all numbers other than <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
. This makes sense, because at  <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
 we would have to divide by zero, which is undefined.  The  lines of the graph get closer and closer to the value <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, but never touch.</p>

The graph ascends from negative infinity to positive infinity for negative x-values. For positive x-values, it ascends from negative infinity to positive infinity again. It therefore has a vertical asymptote where the graph is discontinuous, at x=0.</p>


<h3>
Finding Domains of Radical Functions</h3>

<p>
The principal square root function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\sqrt x$</span>
 (usually just referred to as the "square root function") is a function that maps the set of non-negative real numbers onto itself.  </p>



<a href='../images/0414.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0414.png' alt='Radical Function'></a>

<div><b><i>Radical Function</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\sqrt x$</span>
 consists of a restricted domain of <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq 0$</span>
, or non-negative real numbers, since we can not take the square root of a negative number. Half of a sideways parabola, with its vertex at the origin and existing for only positive x and y values (only in the first quadrant).</p>

<p>Note that half of the parabola is missing since functions cannot have more than one value at a point, and the square root function is taken to yield a positive value (though <span class='clFormula'>$(-x)^2$</span>
 gives the same value as <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
 so the square root of a number <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 such that <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
 would be <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt y = \pm x$</span>
). It is important to remember when graphing the roots that negative values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 will not produce real numbers. This will be explained further in the section on imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>To determine the domain of a radical function algebraically, find the values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 for which the radicand is nonnegative (set it equal to <span class='clFormula'>$\geq 0$</span>
) and then solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.  The <em>radicand</em> is the number or expression underneath the radical sign.  All values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 except for those that satisfy <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt x \geq 0$</span>
 are the domain of the function. </p>

<h3>
Example 3:  What is the domain of the radical function:</h3>

<h3>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x) = \sqrt {x-3} +4$</span></h3>

<p>Set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 to find the restrictions on the domain:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;{x-3} \geq 0$</span></p>
<p>Therefore <span class='clFormula'>$x \geq 3$</span>
.  So, all real number greater than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 is the domain of the function.</p>

<h3>Graphical Behavior of Functions</h3>

<p>
As part of exploring how functions change, we can identify intervals over which the function is changing in specific ways. We say that a function is <em>increasing</em> on an interval if the function values increase as the input values increase within that interval.
Similarly, a function is <em>decreasing</em> on an interval if the function values decrease as the input values increase over that interval.
</p>


<ul>
<li>An increasing function is one where for every <span class='clFormula'>$x_1$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$x_2$</span>
 that satisfies <span class='clFormula'>$x_2&gt; x_1$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$f(x_{2}) \geq f(x_{1})$</span>
. If it is strictly greater than <span class='clFormula'>$(f(x_2)&gt;f(x_1))$</span>
, then it is strictly increasing.</li>
<li>A decreasing function is one where for every <span class='clFormula'>$x_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x_2$</span>
 that satisfies <span class='clFormula'>$x_2&gt; x_1$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$f(x_{2}) \leq f(x_{1})$</span>
. If it is strictly less than <span class='clFormula'>$(f(x_2) &lt; f(x_1))$</span>
, then it is strictly decreasing.</li>
</ul>


<p>In terms of a linear function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=mx+b$</span>
, if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is positive, the function is increasing, if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is negative, it is decreasing, and if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is zero, the function is a constant function.</p>
<p>
The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive, and the average rate of change of a decreasing function is negative. The figure below shows examples of increasing and decreasing intervals on a function.

<p>
In mathematics, a <em>constant function</em> is a function whose values do not vary, regardless of the input into the function.  A function is a constant function if <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=c$</span>

and some constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>

<p>Minima and maxima are used heavily in optimization problems and artificial intelligence where, given a number of constraints on resources, we want the best use of our resources.

However, because there is not unlimited time to identify the right plan, artificial intelligence often simply finds the local minima.

<h3>
Definitions of Minimums and Maximums: Relative versus Global</h3>

<p>In mathematics, the maximum and minimum of a function (known collectively as extrema<em>)</em> are the largest and smallest value that a function takes at a point either within a given neighborhood (local or relative extremum) or within the function domain in its entirety (global or absolute extremum).</p>

<div><b><i>Examples of Relative and Global Extrema</i></b></div>
<p>This graph has examples of all four possibilities: relative (local) maximum and minimum, and global maximum and minimum.</p>

<p>While some functions are increasing (or decreasing) over their entire domain, many others are not.  A value of the input where a function changes from increasing to decreasing (as we go from left to right, that is, as the input variable  increases) is called a relative maximum.  If a function has more than one, we say it has local maxima.  Similarly, a value of the input where a function changes from decreasing to increasing as the input variable increases is called a relative minimum. The plural form is local minima.  </p>
<p>A function is also neither increasing nor decreasing at extrema. Note that we have to speak of local extrema, because any given local extremum as defined here is not necessarily the highest maximum or lowest minimum in the function’s entire domain.</p>

<h3>Distingushing Relative and Global Maximum and Minimum</h3>

<h3>Example 1:  Find all maxima and minima in the graph below:</h3>






<a href='../images/0421.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0421.png' alt='Relative Max and Min graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Relative Max and Min graph</i></b></div>
<p>This curve shows  a relative minimum at <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,-2)$</span>
 and relative maximum at <span class='clFormula'>$(1,2)$</span>
.</p>

<p>The graph attains a local maximum at <span class='clFormula'>$(1,2)$</span>
 because it is the highest point in an open interval around <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
.  The local maximum is the y-coordinate at <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
 which is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
.</p>
<p>The graph attains a local minimum at <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,-2)$</span>
because it is the lowest point in an open interval around <span class='clFormula'>$x=-1$</span>
. The local minimum is the <em>y</em>-coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$x=-1$</span>
which is <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>

<p>The graph attains an <em>absolute maximum</em> in two locations, <span class='clFormula'>$x=-2$</span>

<p>The graph attains an <em>absolute minimum</em> at <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Piecewise functions are defined using the common functional notation, where the body of the function is an array of functions and associated subdomains.</li>
<li>The absolute value, <span class='clFormula'>$\left | x \right |$</span>

<li>Piecewise functions may have horizontal or vertical gaps (or both) in their functions. A horizontal gap means that the function is not defined for those inputs.</li>
<li>An open circle at the end of an interval  means that the end point is not included in the interval, i.e. strictly less than or strictly greater than. A closed circle means the end point is included.</li>
</ul>

</dl>

<p>In mathematics, a <em>piecewise function</em>
is a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output over different pieces of the domain.  Piecewise functions are defined using the common functional notation, where the body of the function is an array of functions and associated intervals.  We use piecewise functions to describe situations in which a rule or relationship changes as the input value crosses certain “boundaries.”
</p>

<h3>Graphing Piecewise Functions</h3>

<h3>Example 1: Consider the piecewise definition of the absolute value function:</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\left | x \right |= \left\{\begin{matrix} -x, &amp; if\ x&lt;0\\ x, &amp; if\ x\geq0 \end{matrix}\right.$</div>

<p>For all <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values less than zero, the first function <span class='clFormula'>$(-x)$</span>
is used, which negates the sign of the input value, making the output values positive. Allowing <span class='clFormula'>$y=f(x)$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=|x|$</span>
, some ordered pair examples of <span class='clFormula'>$(x,|x|)$</span>
 are: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(-2,2) \\&#10;(-1,1) \\&#10;(-0.5,0.5)$</div>

<p> For all values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
greater than or equal to zero, the second function <span class='clFormula'>$(x)$</span>
is used, making the output values  equal to the input values.  Some ordered pair examples are:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(2,2) \\&#10;(1,1) \\&#10;(0.5,0.5)$</div>

<p>After finding and plotting some ordered pairs for all parts ("pieces") of the function the result is the V-shaped curve of the absolute value function below.</p>



<a href='../images/0423.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0423.png' alt='Piecewise function: absolute value'></a>

<div><b><i>Piecewise function: absolute value</i></b></div>
<p>
The piecewise function, <span class='clFormula'>$\left | x \right |= \left\{\begin{matrix} -x, &amp; if\ x&lt;0\\ x, &amp; if\ x\geq0 \end{matrix}\right.$</span>
, is  the graph of the absolute value function.  Each part of the function is graphed based upon the specific domain chosen. A v-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Graph the function and determine its domain and range:</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)= \left\{\begin{matrix} &#10;x^2, &amp; if\ x \leq 1\\ &#10;3, &amp; if\ 1&lt;x\leq 2\\ &#10;x, &amp; if\ x&gt;2\\ &#10;\end{matrix}\right.$</div>

<p>Start by choosing values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 for the first piece of the function, such as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle x=-2,-1,0,1$</div>

<p>  Substitute those values into the first part of the piecewise function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(-2)=4 \\&#10;f(-1)=1 \\&#10;f(0)=0 \\&#10;f(1)=1 $</div>

<p>Those points satisfy the first part of the function and create the following ordered pairs: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(-2,4)\\&#10;(-1,1)\\&#10;(0,0)\\&#10;(1,1)$</span></p>
<p>For the middle part (piece), <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=3$</span>
 (a constant function) for the domain <span class='clFormula'>$1&lt;x\leq 2$</span>
, a few ordered pairs are: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(1.5,3)\\&#10;(1.8, 3)\\&#10;(2,3)$</div>

<p>For the last part (piece), <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x$</span>
 for the domain <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;2$</span>
, a few ordered pairs are:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(2.5,2.5)\\&#10;(3,3)\\&#10;(4,4)$</div>

<p>Now graph all the ordered pairs:</p>



<a href='../images/0424.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0424.png' alt='Piecewise Function'></a>

<div><b><i>Piecewise Function</i></b></div>
<p>The piecewise function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)= \left\{\begin{matrix} x^2, &amp; if\ x \leq 1\\ 3, &amp; if\         1&lt;x\leq 2\\ x, &amp; if\ x&gt;2\\ \end{matrix}\right.$</span>
 has three parts (pieces).  Depending on the value of the domain, each piece is different. A parabola with vertex at the origin for x-values less than 1. A straight horizontal line at a height of 3 from x=1 to x=2. A line with a slope of 1 from x=2.</p>

<p>Notice the open and closed circles in the graph.  This has to do with the specific domains for each part of the function.  An open circle at the end of an interval means that the end point is not included in the interval, i.e. strictly less than or strictly greater than. A closed circle means the end point is included (equal to).</p>
<p>
The domain of the function starts at negative infinity and continues through each piece, without any gaps, to positive infinity.  Since there is an closed AND open dot at <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
 the function is piecewise continuous there.  When <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
, the function is also piecewise continuous.  Therefore the domain of this function is the set of all real numbers, <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
.</p>
<p>The range begins at the lowest <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value, <span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
 and is continuous through positive infinity.  Even though there looks like a gap from <span class='clFormula'>$y=1$</span>
 to <span class='clFormula'>$y=2$</span>
, the piece of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 includes those values.  Therefore the range of the piecewise function is also the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, or all non-negative values:  <span class='clFormula'>$y \geq 0$</span>
. </p>

<h3>Properties of a One-To-One Function</h3>

<p>A <em>one-to-one function</em>, also called an injective function, never maps distinct elements of its domain to the same element of its co-domain. In other words, every element of the function's range corresponds to exactly one element of its domain. Occasionally, an injective function from <span class='clFormula'>$X$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$Y$</span>
is denoted <span class='clFormula'>$f: X \mapsto Y$</span>
, using an arrow with a barbed tail. </p>
<p>An easy way to check if a function is a one-to-one is by graphing it and then performing the horizontal line test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, the function is not one-to-one. To see this, note that the points of intersection have the same y-value, because they lie on the line, but different x values, which by definition means the function cannot be one-to-one.</p>



<a href='../images/0425.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0425.png' alt='Horizontal line test'></a>

<div><b><i>Horizontal line test</i></b></div>
<p>Because the horizontal line crosses the graph of the function more than once, it fails the horizontal line test and cannot be one-to-one. A cubic polynomial with one peak and then one trough. A horizontal line crosses through four points of the function if it is at a y-value less than the peak and greater than the trough.</p>


<h3>Determining If a Function is One-To-One</h3>

<h3>Example 1:  Is the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)={x}^{2}$</span>
 (with no domain restrictions) one-to-one? </h3>

<p>One way to check if the function is one-to-one is to graph the function and perform the horizontal line test.  The graph below shows that it forms a parabola and fails the horizontal line test.</p>



<a href='../images/0426.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0426.png' alt='&#10;Parabola graph&#10;&#10;'></a>

<div><b><i>
Parabola graph
</i></b></div>
<p>
The graph of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 fails
the horizontal line test and is therefore not a one-to-one function.
 If a horizontal line can go through two or more points on the
function's graph then the function is not one-to-one. A u-shaped curve with vertex at the origin. Any horizontal line above the x-axis would cross two points on the function</p>

<p>Another way to determine if the function is one-to-one is to make a table of values and check to see if every element of the range corresponds to exactly one element of the domain.  A list of ordered pairs for the function are: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(-2,4)\\&#10;(-1,1)\\&#10;(0,0)\\&#10;(1,1)\\&#10;(2,4)$</div>

<p> The ordered pairs <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,4)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4)$</span>
 do not pass the definition of one-to-one because the element <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 of the range corresponds to to <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. Each unique input must have a unique output so the function cannot be one-to-one. Notice also, that these two ordered pairs form a horizontal line; which also means that the function is not one-to-one as stated earlier.</p>

<h3>Example 2:  Is the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\left | x \right |$</span>
 one-to-one?  </h3>

<p>This is an absolute value function, which is graphed below. Notice it fails the horizontal line test. Because each unique input does not have a unique output, this function cannot be one-to-one.</p>



<a href='../images/0427.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0427.png' alt='Absolute value graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Absolute value graph</i></b></div>
<p>

<blockquote>Two objects have symmetry if one object can be obtained from the other by a transformation.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Determine whether or not a given relation shows some form of symmetry</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A function has symmetry if it can be transformed in some way without changing the function.</li>
<li>A function can be symmetric about a point if it can be rotated a fixed amount around that point without changing it.</li>
<li>A function can be symmetric about a line if it can be reflected over that line without changing it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>symmetry</dt>
<dd>A property in mathematics where an object can undergo a transformation while preserving its properties.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Symmetry</h3>

<p>In mathematics, an object such as a shape or a function has symmetry if it can be transformed in some way that preserves the properties of the mathematical object. In geometry, a geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two
or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion.s means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation
that moves individual pieces of the object but doesn't change the
overall shape.</p>
<p>For functions, a function exhibits symmetry if each point of a function can be changed according to a mathematical rule without changing the overall function. Determining symmetry can involve graphing the function or evaluating the function algebraically. </p>

<h3>Symmetric Function Types</h3>

<p>Functions and relations can be symmetric about a point, a line, or an axis.  They can also have symmetry after a  reflection.  </p>
<p>To determine if a relation has symmetry, graph the relation or function and see if the original curve is a reflection of itself over a point, line, or axis.  The image below shows examples of reflecting a function over the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis (vertical reflection) and over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis (horizontal reflection).  </p>
<p> </p>



<a href='../images/0428.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0428.png' alt='Reflection'></a>

<div><b><i>Reflection</i></b></div>
<p>A function can be reflected over the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
axis. If the function looks the same after the reflection, the function is symmetric over that axis. The original function f(x) has the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote and increases to positive infinity in the first quadrant. It is always positive and increasing in quadrants 1 and 2. When reflected over the y-axis, the function becomes f(-x), and still has the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote, but decreases from positive infinity towards the x-axis. It is still always positive. When the original function is reflected over the x-axis, it becomes -f(x), keeps the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote, but decreases away from it, decreasing to negative infinity in the fourth quadrant. It is always negative in quadrants 3 and 4.</p>

<p>In the next graph below, quadratic functions have symmetry over a line called the axis of symmetry.  The axis splits the U-shaped curve into two parts of the curve which are reflected over the axis of symmetry.  </p>



<a href='../images/0429.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0429.png' alt='Symmetry Parabola'></a>

<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2+4x+3$</span>
 shows an axis of symmetry about the line <span class='clFormula'>$x=-2$</span>
.  The curve is split into <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
equivalent halves.  Notice that the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts are reflected points over the axis of symmetry and are equidistant from the axis. The parabola's axis of symmetry is a vertical line at x=-2. The x-intercepts are symmetric about this axis, at x=-3 and -1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The parity of a function does not necessarily reveal whether the function is odd or even.</li>
<li>Even functions are algebraically defined as functions in which the following relationship holds for all values of:  <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=f(-x)$</span>

<dt>additive inverse</dt>
<dd>The opposite with respect of addition.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Even and Odd Definitions</h3>

<p>Functions can be classified as "odd" or "even" based on their composition. These labels correlate with symmetry properties of the function.</p>
<p>The terms "odd" and "even" can only be applied to a limited set of functions. For a function to be classified as one or the other, it must have an additive inverse. Therefore, it must have a number that, when added to it, equals <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the parity of a function will reveal whether it is odd or even. For example, the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
is even because it has an exponent, <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
, that is an even integer. This, however, does not apply in every instance.  For example, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=\left | x^3 \right |$</span>
has an exponent that is of an odd integer, <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, but is also an even function.  How can we check if a function is odd or even?  Let's look at their characteristics.</p>

<h3>Even Functions</h3>

<p>Even functions are algebraically defined as functions in which the following relationship holds for all values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)=f(-x)$</div>

<p>To check if a function is even, any <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value chosen must yield the same output value when substituted into the function as <span class='clFormula'>$-x$</span>
.  </p>

<h3>Example 1: Is the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^4+2x$</span>
 even?  </h3>

<p>Remember the degree of the function, in this case a <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 which is even, may not always dictate if the function is in fact even.  </p>
<p>First, perform an algebraic check:  Substitute a value for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$-x$</span>
 into the function and check that the same output is found.  Let <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
: will <span class='clFormula'>$f(2)=f(-2)?$</span></p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;f(2)&amp;=(2)^4+2(2)\\&#10;&amp;=16+4\\&#10;&amp;=20&#10;\end{align}$</span>
         </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;f(-2)&amp;=(-2)^4+2(-2)\\&#10;&amp;=16-4\\&#10;&amp;=12&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p> Therefore <span class='clFormula'>$f(2)\neq f(-2)$</span>
 and the function is not even.</p>



<a href='../images/0431.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0431.png' alt='Symmetry: even function?'></a>

<div><b><i>Symmetry: even function?</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^4+2x$</span>
 pictured above is not even because the graph is not symmetric about the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.  For example the point <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,-1)$</span>
 does not reflect onto the point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,-1)$</span>
.</p>

<p>We can confirm this graphically: functions that satisfy the requirements of being even are symmetric about the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis. Therefore, for every point <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
 on the graph, the corresponding point <span class='clFormula'>$(-x,y)$</span>
 or vice versa, is also on the graph.  </p>

<h3>Odd Functions</h3>

<p>Odd functions are algebraically defined as functions in which the following relationship holds true for all values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-f(x)=f(-x)$</div>

<p>This relationship can also be expressed as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;f(x)+f(-x)=0$</div>

<p>To check if a function is odd, the negation of the function (be sure to negate all terms of the function) must yield the same output as substituting the value <span class='clFormula'>$-x$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Is the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^3-9x$</span>
 odd?</h3>

<p>Algebraic check: Does  <span class='clFormula'>$-f(x)=f(-x)$</span>
?  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;-f(x)&amp;=-(x^3-9x)\\&amp;&#10;=-x^3+9x&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;f(-x)&amp;=(-x)^3-9(-x)\\&amp;&#10;=-x^3+9x&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore <span class='clFormula'>$-f(x)=f(-x)$</span>
 and the function is odd.</p>
<p>Graphical check:  Functions that satisfy the requirements of being odd are symmetric with respect to the origin. In other words, rotating the graph <span class='clFormula'>$180$</span>
degrees about the point of origin results in the same, unchanged graph.  In addition, for every point <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
 on the graph, the corresponding point <span class='clFormula'>$(-x,-y)$</span>
 is also on the graph. </p>



<a href='../images/0432.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0432.png' alt='Symmetry: odd function?'></a>

<div><b><i>Symmetry: odd function?</i></b></div>
<p>The function, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^3-9x$</span>
 is odd since the graph is symmetric about the origin.  One can also check that any point is symmetric about the origin: for example, does <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,8)$</span>
 yield <span class='clFormula'>$(1,-8)$</span>
?  Yes, those two points are symmetric about the origin.</p>

<h2 id='section_31'>4.4. Transformations</h2>

<h3 id='concept_117'>4.4.1. Transformations of Functions</h3>

<blockquote>Transformations alter a function while maintaining the original characteristics of that function.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Determine whether a given transformation is an example of translation, scaling, rotation, or reflection</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Transformations are ways that a function can be adjusted to create new functions.</li>
<li>Transformations often preserve the original shape of the function.</li>
<li>Common types of transformations include rotations, translations, reflections, and scaling (also known as stretching/shrinking).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>translation</dt>
<dd>Shift of an entire function in a specific direction.</dd>
<dt>Scaling</dt>
<dd>Changes the size and/or the shape of the function.</dd>
<dt>rotation</dt>
<dd>Spins the function around the origin.</dd>
<dt>reflection</dt>
<dd>Mirror image of a function.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A transformation takes a basic function and changes it slightly with predetermined methods.  This change will cause the graph of the function to move, shift, or stretch, depending on the type of transformation.  The four main types of transformations are translations, reflections, rotations, and scaling.</p>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>A translation moves every point by a fixed distance in the same direction. The movement is caused by the addition or subtraction of a constant from a function.  As an example, let <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^3$</span>
.  One possible translation of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 would be <span class='clFormula'>$x^3 + 2$</span>
.  This would then be read as, "the translation of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 by two in the positive y direction".  </p>



<a href='../images/0433.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0433.png' alt='Graph of a function being translated'></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of a function being translated</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^3$</span>
 is translated  by two in the positive <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 direction (up).</p>


<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p>A reflection of a function causes the graph to appear as a mirror image of the original function.  This can be achieved by switching the sign of the input going into the function.  Let the function in question be <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^5$</span>
.  The mirror image of this function across the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis would then be <span class='clFormula'>$f(-x) = -x^5$</span>
.  Therefore, we can say that <span class='clFormula'>$f(-x)$</span>
 is a reflection of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 across the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.  </p>



<a href='../images/0434.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0434.png' alt='Graph of a function being reflected'></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of a function being reflected</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^5$</span>
 is reflected over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.</p>


<h3>Rotations</h3>

<p>
A rotation is a transformation that is performed by "spinning" the object around a fixed point known as the center of rotation.  Although the concept is simple, it has the most advanced mathematical process of the transformations discussed.  There are two formulas that are used:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$x_1 = x_0cos\theta - y_0sin\theta \\ y_1 = x_0sin\theta + y_0cos\theta$</span>
 </p>
<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$x_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y_1$</span>
are the new expressions for the rotated function, <span class='clFormula'>$x_0$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y_0$</span>
 are the original expressions from the function being transformed, and <span class='clFormula'>$\theta$</span>
 is the angle at which the function is to be rotated.  As an example, let <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
.  If we rotate this function by 90 degrees, the new function reads:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$[xsin(\frac{\pi}{2}) + ycos(\frac{\pi}{2})] = [xcos(\frac{\pi}{2}) - ysin(\frac{\pi}{2})]^2$</span></p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>Scaling is a transformation that changes the size and/or the shape of the graph of the function.  Note that until now, none of the transformations we discussed could change the size and shape of a function - they only moved the graphical output from one set of points to another set of points.  As an example, let <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^3$</span>
.  Following from this, <span class='clFormula'>$2f(x) = 2x^3$</span>
.  The graph has now physically gotten "taller", with every point on the graph of the original function being multiplied by two. </p>



<a href='../images/0435.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0435.png' alt='Graph of a function being scaled'></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of a function being scaled</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^3$</span>
 is scaled by a factor of two.</p>

<h3 id='concept_118'>4.4.2. Translations</h3>

<blockquote>A translation of a function is a shift in one or more directions. It is represented by adding or subtracting from either y or x.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Manipulate functions so that they are translated vertically and horizontally</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A translation is a function that moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction.</li>
<li>A vertical translation is generally given by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=f(x)+b$</span>
. These translations shift the whole function up or down the y-axis.</li>
<li>A horizontal translation is generally given by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=f(x-a)$</span>
. These translations shift the whole function side to side on the x-axis.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>vertical translation</dt>
<dd>A shift of the function along the <equation>$y$</equation>-axis.</dd>
<dt>translation</dt>
<dd>A shift of the whole function  by a specified amount.</dd>
<dt>horizontal translation</dt>
<dd>A shift of the function along the <equation>$x$</equation>-axis.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A translation moves every point in a function a constant distance in a specified direction. In algebra, this essentially manifests as a vertical or horizontal shift of a function. A translation can be interpreted as shifting the origin of the coordinate system.</p>

<h3>Vertical Translations</h3>

<p>To translate a function vertically is to shift the function up or down. If a positive number is added, the function shifts up the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis by the amount added.  If a positive number is subtracted, the function shifts down the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis by the amount subtracted.  In general, a vertical translation is given by the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = f(x) + b$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is some given function and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is the constant that we are adding to cause a translation.</p>
<p>Let's use a basic quadratic function to explore vertical translations.  The original function we will use is:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = x^2$</span>
. </p>
<p>Translating the function  up the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis by two produces the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=x^2 + 2$</div>

<p>And translating the function down the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis by two produces the equation:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2 - 2$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0436.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0436.png' alt='Vertical translations'></a>

<div><b><i>Vertical translations</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 is translated both up and down by two.</p>


<h3>Horizontal Translations </h3>

<p>To translate a function horizontally is the shift the function left or right. While vertical shifts are caused by adding or subtracting a value outside of the function parameters, horizontal shifts are caused by adding or subtracting a value inside the function parameters.  The general equation for a horizontal shift is given by:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = f(x-a)$</div>

<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 would be the original function, and <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is the constant being added or subtracted to cause a horizontal shift.  When <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is positive, the function is shifted to the right.  When <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is negative, the function is shifted to the left.   </p>
<p>Let's use the same basic quadratic function to look at horizontal translations. Again, the original function  is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = x^2$</span>
.</p>
<p>Shifting the function to the left by two produces the  equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= f(x+2)\\&#10; &amp;= (x+2)^2&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Shifting the function  to the right by two produces the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= f(x-2)\\&#10;&amp; = (x-2)^2&#10;\end{align}$</div>




<a href='../images/0437.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0437.png' alt='Horizontal translation'></a>

<div><b><i>Horizontal translation</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2$</span>
 is translated both left and right by two.</p>

<h3 id='concept_119'>4.4.3. Reflections</h3>

<blockquote>Reflections are a type of transformation that move an entire curve such that its mirror image lies on the other side of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the reflection of a function over the <equation>$x$</equation>-axis, <equation>$y$</equation>-axis, or the line <equation>$y=x$</equation></p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A reflection swaps all of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values across the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, respectively. It can be visualized by imagining that a mirror lies across that axis.</li>
<li>A vertical reflection is given by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y = -f(x)$</span>
and results in the curve being "reflected" across the x-axis.</li>
<li>A horizontal reflection is given by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y = f(-x)$</span>
and results in the curve being "reflected" across the y-axis.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Reflection</dt>
<dd>A mirror image of a function across a given line.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Reflections produce a mirror image of a function.  The reflection of a function can be performed along the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, or any line.  For this section we will focus on the two axes and the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
. </p>

<h3>Vertical Reflections</h3>

<p>A vertical reflection is a reflection across the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, given by the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=-f(x)$</div>

<p>In this general equation, all <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values are switched to their negative counterparts while the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values remain the same. The result is that the curve becomes flipped over the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis.  As an example, let the original function be: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y  = x^2$</span>
 </p>
<p> The vertical reflection would then produce the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= -f(x)\\ &amp;&#10;= -x^2&#10;\end{align}$</div>




<a href='../images/0438.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0438.png' alt='Vertical reflection'></a>

<div><b><i>Vertical reflection</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
 is reflected over the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis.</p>


<h3>Horizontal Reflections</h3>

<p>A horizontal reflection is a reflection across the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, given by the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=f(-x)$</div>

<p>
In this general equation, all <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values are switched to their negative counterparts while the y values remain the same. The result is that the curve becomes flipped over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.  Consider an example where the original function is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = (x-2)^2$</div>

<p>Therefore the horizontal reflection produces the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= f(-x)\\ &#10;&amp;= (-x-2)^2&#10;\end{align}$</div>




<a href='../images/0439.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0439.png' alt='Horizontal reflection'></a>

<div><b><i>Horizontal reflection</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=(x-2)^2$</span>
 is reflected over the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis.</p>


<h3>Reflections Across a Line </h3>

<p>The third type of reflection is a reflection across a line.  Let's look at the case involving the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
.  This reflection has the effect of swapping the variables  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, which is exactly like the case of an inverse function.  As an example, let the original function be:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = x^2$</div>

<p>The reflected equation, as reflected across the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span>
, would then be:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = \pm \sqrt{x}$</div>




<a href='../images/0440.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0440.png' alt='Reflection over '></a>

<div><b><i>Reflection over <span class='clFormula'>$y=x$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>

.</p>

<h3 id='concept_120'>4.4.4. Stretching and Shrinking</h3>

<blockquote>Stretching and shrinking refer to transformations that alter how compact a function looks in the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Manipulate functions so that they stretch or shrink</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>When by either <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>

</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>scaling</dt>
<dd>A transformation that changes the size and/or shape of the graph of the function.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In algebra, equations can undergo scaling, meaning they can be stretched horizontally or vertically along an axis.  This is accomplished by multiplying either  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 by a constant, respectively.  </p>

<h3>Vertical Scaling </h3>

<p>First, let's talk about vertical scaling.  Multiplying the entire function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 by a constant greater than one causes all the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values of an equation to increase. This leads to a "stretched" appearance in the vertical direction. If the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is multiplied by a value less than one, all the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values of the equation will decrease, leading to a "shrunken" appearance in the vertical direction.  In general, the equation for vertical scaling is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = bf(x)$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is some  function and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is an
arbitrary constant.  If <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is greater than one the function will undergo vertical stretching, and if <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is less than one the function will undergo vertical shrinking.  </p>
<p>As an example, consider the initial sinusoidal function presented below:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = \sin(x)$</span>
 </p>
<p>If we want to vertically stretch the function by a factor of three, then the new function becomes:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= 3f(x) \\&#10;&amp;= 3\sin(x)&#10;\end{align}$</div>




<a href='../images/0441.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0441.png' alt='Vertical scaling'></a>

<div><b><i>Vertical scaling</i></b></div>
<p>The function <span class='clFormula'>$y=\sin(x)$</span>
 is stretched by a factor of three in the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 direction.</p>


<h3>Horizontal Scaling </h3>

<p>Now lets analyze horizontal scaling. 
Multiplying the independent variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 by a constant greater than one causes all the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values of an equation to increase. This leads to a "shrunken" appearance in the horizontal direction. If the independent variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is multiplied by a value less than one, all the x values of the equation will decrease, leading to a "stretched" appearance in the horizontal direction.  In general, the equation for horizontal scaling is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = f(cx)$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 is some function and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
 is an arbitrary constant.  If <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is greater than one the function will undergo horizontal shrinking, and if <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is less than one the function will undergo horizontal stretching.  </p>
<p>As an example, consider again the initial sinusoidal function:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y  = \sin(x)$</div>

<p>If we want to induce horizontal shrinking, the new function becomes:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= f(3x)\\ &#10;&amp;= \sin(3x)&#10;\end{align}$</div>
