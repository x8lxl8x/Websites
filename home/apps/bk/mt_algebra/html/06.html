<h3 id='concept_127'>6.1.1. What is a Quadratic Function?</h3>

<blockquote>Quadratic equations are second order polynomials, and have the form <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$</span>
.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the criteria for, and properties of, quadratic functions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A quadratic function is of the form <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$</span>
, where a is a nonzero constant, b and c are constants of any value, and x is the independent variable. </li>
<li>The solutions to a quadratic equation are known as its zeros, or roots.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>quadratic function</dt>
<dd>A function of degree two.</dd>
<dt>dependent variable</dt>
<dd>Affected by a change in input, i.e. it changes depending on the value of the input.</dd>
<dt>independent variable</dt>
<dd>The input of a function that can be freely varied.</dd>
<dt>vertex</dt>
<dd>The minimum or maximum point of a quadratic function. </dd>
</dl>



<p>The single defining feature of quadratic functions is that they are of the second order, or of degree two. This means that in all quadratic functions, the highest exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
in a non-zero term is equal to two.  A quadratic function is of the general form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
are constants and <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is the independent variable.  The constants  <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
can take any finite value, and <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
can take any finite value other than <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
.  </p>


<p>A quadratic equation is a specific case of a quadratic function, with the function set equal to zero:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c=0$</div>

<p>When all constants are known, a quadratic equation can be solved as to find a solution of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.  Such solutions are known as zeros.  There are several ways of finding <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
,  but these methods will be discussed later.</p>



<h3>Differences Between Quadratics and Linear Functions</h3>

<p>Quadratic equations are different than linear functions in a few key ways. </p>
<ul>
<li>Linear functions either always decrease (if they have negative slope) or always increase (if they have positive slope). All quadratic functions both increase and decrease.</li>
<li> With a linear function, each input has an individual, unique output (assuming the output is not a constant).  With a quadratic function, pairs of unique independent variables will produce the same dependent variable, with only one exception (the vertex) for a given quadratic function.</li>
<li>The slope of a quadratic function, unlike the slope of a linear function, is constantly changing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forms of Quadratic Functions</h3>

<p>Quadratic functions can be expressed in many different forms. The form written above is called standard form. Additionally</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x)=a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$</div>

<p>is known as factored form, where <span class='clFormula'>$x_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x_2$</span>
are the zeros, or roots, of the equation. These are <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values at which the function crosses the y-axis (and thus where <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 equals zero). </p>
<p>The vertex form is displayed as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$</div>

<p> where <span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
are respectively the coordinates of the vertex, the point at which the function reaches either its maximum (if <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is negative) or minimum (if <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is positive).</p>

<h3 id='concept_129'>6.1.2. The Quadratic Formula</h3>

<blockquote>The zeros of a quadratic equation can be found by solving  the quadratic formula.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve for the roots of a quadratic function by using the quadratic formula</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The quadratic formula is: <span class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
are the coefficients of the <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
terms, respectively, in a quadratic equation, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is the value of the equation's constant.</li>
<li>To use the quadratic formula, <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2 + bx+c $</span>
must equal zero and <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
must not be zero.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>zero</dt>
<dd>Also known as a root,  an <equation>$x$</equation> value at which the function of <equation>$x$</equation> is equal to 0.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The quadratic formula is one tool that can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation.  It is written:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}$</div>

<p>where the values of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
are the values of the coefficients in the quadratic equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c=0$</div>

<p>The quadratic formula can always be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex, whole numbers or fractions, and so on.</p>

<h3>Criteria For Use</h3>

<p>To use the quadratic formula, two criteria must be satisfied:</p>

<ol>
<li>The quadratic equation must equal zero;  <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c=0$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 must not equal zero</li>
</ol>
<p>The first criterion must be satisfied to use the quadratic formula because conceptually, the formula gives the values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 where the quadratic function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = ax^2+bx+c = 0$</span>
; the roots of the quadratic function.</p>
<p>You can see why the second condition must be true by looking at the quadratic formula. If <span class='clFormula'>$a=0$</span>
, the denominator of the formula is zero, which results in an undefined quantity. Conceptually, this makes sense because if   <span class='clFormula'>$a=0$</span>
, then the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = ax^2 + bx+c$</span>
 is not quadratic, but linear!</p>

<h3>Solving Quadratic Equations with the Quadratic Formula</h3>

<p>Solutions to
<span class='clFormula'>$ax^2 + bx+c =0$</span>
can be found by using the quadratic formula</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}$</div>

<p>The symbol ± indicates there will be two solutions, one that involves adding the square root of <span class='clFormula'>$b^2-4ac$</span>
, and the other found by subtracting said square root. The resulting <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values (zeros) may or may not be distinct, and may or may not be real.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at an example.  Suppose we want to find the roots of the following quadratic function:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x) = 2x^2+5x+3$</div>

<p>First, we need to set the function equal to zero, as the roots are where the function equals zero.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0 = 2x^2+5x+3$</div>

<p>Second, we need to identify the constants in the equation.  The value of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is two, the value of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is five, and the value of <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
 is three.  We can now substitute these values into the quadratic equation and simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2-4(2)(3)}}{2(2)}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$x= \dfrac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25-24}}{4}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$x = \dfrac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{4}$</div>

<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle x = \frac{-5}{4} + \frac{1}{4}$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{-5}{4} - \frac{1}{4}$</span></p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$x = \dfrac{-3}{4}$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{-6}{4}$</span></p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-3}{4}$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{-3}{2}$</span></p>

<h3 id='concept_130'>6.1.3. The Discriminant</h3>

<blockquote>The discriminant of a polynomial is a function of its coefficients that reveals information about the polynomial's roots.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain how and why the discriminant can be used to find the number of real roots of a quadratic equation</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$\Delta =b^2-4ac$</span>
is the formula for a quadratic function's discriminant.</li>
<li>If Δ is greater than zero, the polynomial has two real, distinct roots. </li>
<li>If Δ is equal to zero, the polynomial has only one real root. </li>
<li>If Δ is less than zero, the polynomial has no real roots, only two distinct complex roots.</li>
<li>A zero is the x value whereat the function crosses the x-axis. That is, it is the x-coordinate at which the function's value equals zero.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<p>
The discriminant of a quadratic function is a function of its coefficients that reveals information about its roots. A root is the value of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
coordinate where the function crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. That is, it is the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate at which the function's value equals zero.</p>
<p>The discriminant for quadratic functions is:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\Delta = b^2-4ac$</span>
 </p>
<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
are the coefficients in <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$</span>
. The number of roots of the function can be determined by the value of <span class='clFormula'>$\Delta$</span>
.</p>

<h3>The Discriminant and the Quadratic Formula</h3>

<p>Recall the quadratic formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>${x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
are the constants (<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
must be non-zero) from a quadratic polynomial.  </p>
<p>The discriminant <span class='clFormula'>$\Delta =b^2-4ac$</span>
is the portion of the quadratic formula under the square root.  </p>

<h3>Positive Discriminant</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>${\Delta}$</span>
is positive, the square root in the quadratic formula is positive, and the solutions do not involve imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$x={\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{\text{positive number}}}{2a}}$</span></p>
<p>Because adding and subtracting a positive number will result in different values, a positive discriminant results in two distinct solutions, and two distinct roots of the quadratic function.</p>

<h3>Zero Discriminant</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>${\Delta}$</span>
is equal to zero, the square root in the quadratic formula is zero:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x={\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{0}}{2a}}$</div>

<p>
Since adding zero and subtracting zero in the quadratic equation lead to the same outcome, there is only one distinct root of the quadratic function.</p>

<h3>Negative Discriminant</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>${\Delta}$</span>
is less than zero, the value under the square root in the quadratic formula is negative:   </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{\text{negative number}}}{2a}$</div>

<p>This means the square root itself is an imaginary number, so the roots of the quadratic function are distinct and not real.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the quadratic function:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x)=x^2-x-2$</div>

<p>Using <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
as the value of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
as the value of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
as the value of <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, the discriminant of this function can be determined as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\Delta =(-1)^2-4\cdot 1 \cdot (-2)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\Delta =9$</div>

<p>Because Δ is greater than zero, the function has two distinct, real roots. Checking graphically, we can confirm this is true; the zeros of the function can be found at  <span class='clFormula'>$x=-1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0601.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0601.png' alt='Example'></a>

<div><b><i>Example</i></b></div>
<p>Graph of a polynomial with the quadratic function <span class='clFormula'>$ f(x) = x^2 - x - 2$</span>
. Because the value is greater than 0, the function has two distinct, real zeros. The graph of shows that it clearly has two roots: the function crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis at <span class='clFormula'>$x=-1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_131'>6.1.4. Other Equations in Quadratic Form</h3>

<blockquote>Many equations with no odd-degree terms can be reduced to quadratics and solved with the same methods as quadratics.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the quadratic formula to solve any equation in quadratic form</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A biquadratic equation (quartic equation with no terms of odd-degree) has the form <span class='clFormula'>$0=ax^4+bx^2+c$</span>
. It can be expressed as: <span class='clFormula'>$0=ap^2+bp+c$</span>
(where <span class='clFormula'>$p=x^2$</span>
).</li>
<li>The values of <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
can be found by graphing, factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Their square roots (positive and negative) are the values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
that satisfy the original equation.</li>
<li>Higher-order equations can be solved by a similar process that involves reducing their exponents. The requirement is that there are two terms of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
such that the ratio of the highest exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
to the lower is <span class='clFormula'>$2:1$</span>
.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>zero</dt>
<dd>Also known as a root; an <equation>$x$</equation> value at which the function of <equation>$x$</equation> is equal to zero.</dd>
<dt>biquadratic</dt>
<dd>When a polynomial involves only the second and fourth powers of a variable.</dd>
<dt>quartic function</dt>
<dd>Any polynomial function whose greatest exponent is of power four.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Higher degree polynomial equations can be very difficult to solve. In some special situations, however, they can be made more manageable by reducing their exponents via substitution.  If a substitution can be made such that the higher order polynomial takes the form of a quadratic, any method  for solving a quadratic equation can be applied.   </p>
<p>For example, if a quartic equation is biquadratic—that is, it includes no terms of an odd-degree— there is a quick way to find the zeroes of the quartic function by reducing it into a quadratic form.  Consider a quadratic function with no odd-degree terms which has the form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=ax^4+bx^2+c$</div>

<p>If we let an arbitrary variable <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
 equal <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
, this can be reduced to an equation of a lower degree:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=ap^2+bp+c$</div>

<p>With substitution, we were able to reduce a higher order polynomial into a quadratic equation.  It can now be solved with any of a number of methods (via graphing, factoring, completing the square, or by using the quadratic formula).</p>
<p>Once values of <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
are found, each positive value of the temporary variable <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
 can be used to find two values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 such that:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\sqrt p$</div>

<p>As with every square root, the root of <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
will have two  values, one positive and one negative.  It is important to realize that
the same kind of substitution can be done for any equation in quadratic form, not just quartics. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>As an example, consider the  equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=x^4-12x^2+20$</div>




<a href='../images/0602.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0602.png' alt='Quartic graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Quartic graph</i></b></div>
<p>Graph of the function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^4-12x^2+20$</span>
.</p>

<p>We can substitute the arbitrary variable <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
 in place of <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=p^2-12p+20$</div>

<p>This equation is now solvable for <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
using the quadratic formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$p=\dfrac {12 \pm \sqrt {(-12)^2-4\cdot 1\cdot 20}}{2\cdot 1}$</div>

<p>Simplifying this, we find <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
equals 2 or 10.</p>
<p>Knowing that <span class='clFormula'>$p=x^2$</span>
, we can use each value of <span class='clFormula'>$p$</span>
to solve for two values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$x=\pm \sqrt 2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x= \pm \sqrt 10$</span></p>
<p>A similar procedure can be used to solve higher-order equations. The requirement is that there are two terms of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
such that the ratio of the highest exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
to the lower is <span class='clFormula'>$2:1$</span>

<p>The y-intercept is the point at which the parabola crosses the <em>y</em>-axis. There cannot be more than one such point, for the graph of a quadratic function. If there were, the curve would not be a function, as there would be two <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values for one <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
value, at zero.</p>

<h3>
<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts</h3>

<p>The <em>x</em>-intercepts are the points at which the parabola crosses the <em>x</em>-axis. If they exist, the <em>x</em>-intercepts represent the zeros, or roots, of the quadratic function, the values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
at which <span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
. There may be zero, one, or two <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts. The number of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts varies depending upon the location of the graph (see the diagram below).</p>



<a href='../images/0605.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0605.png' alt='Possible -intercepts'></a>

<div><b><i>Possible <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts</i></b></div>
<p>A parabola can have no x-intercepts, one x-intercept, or two x-intercepts.</p>

<p>Recall that if the quadratic function is set equal to zero, then the result is a quadratic equation. The solutions to the equation are called the roots of the function. These are the same roots that are observable as the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts of the parabola.</p>
<p>Notice that, for parabolas with two <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts, the vertex always falls between the roots. Due to the fact that parabolas are symmetric, the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate of the vertex is exactly in the middle of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates of the two roots.</p>

<h3 id='concept_385'>6.2.2. A Graphical Interpretation of Quadratic Solutions</h3>

<blockquote>The roots of a quadratic function can be found algebraically or graphically.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the solutions to a quadratic equation as the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The roots of a quadratic function can be found algebraically with the quadratic formula, and graphically by making observations about its parabola. </li>
<li>The solutions, or roots, of a given quadratic equation are the same as the zeros, or <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts, of the graph of the corresponding quadratic function.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>zeros</dt>
<dd>In a given function, the values of <equation>$x$</equation>  at which <equation>$y = 0$</equation>, also called roots.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Recall how the roots of quadratic functions can be found algebraically, using the quadratic formula <span class='clFormula'>$(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a})$</span>
. The roots of a quadratic function can also be found graphically by making observations about its graph. These are two different methods that can be used to reach the same values, and we will now see how they are related.</p>
<p>Consider the quadratic function that is graphed below. Let's solve for its roots both graphically and algebraically.</p>



<a href='../images/0606.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0606.png' alt='Graph of the quadratic function '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of the quadratic function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^2 - x - 2$</span></i></b></div>
<p>Graph showing the parabola on the Cartesian plane, including the points where it crosses the x-axis.</p>

<p>Notice that the parabola intersects the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis at two points:  <span class='clFormula'>$(-1, 0)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(2, 0)$</span>
. Recall that the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts of a parabola indicate the roots, or zeros, of the quadratic function. Therefore, there are roots at <span class='clFormula'>$x = -1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x = 2$</span>
.</p>
<p> Now, let's solve for the roots of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^2 - x- 2$</span>
algebraically with the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>Recall that the quadratic equation sets the quadratic expression equal to zero instead of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0 = x^2 - x - 2$</div>

<p>Now the quadratic formula can be applied to find the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values for which this statement is true. For the given equation, we have the following coefficients: <span class='clFormula'>$a = 1$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b = -1$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c = -2$</span>
.</p>
<p>Substitute these values in the quadratic formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x = \dfrac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt {(-1)^2-4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)}$</div>

<p>Simplifying, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x = \dfrac{1 \pm \sqrt {9}}{2} \\$</div>

<p>and </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x = \dfrac{1 \pm 3}{2}$</div>

<p>We now have two possible values for x: <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1+3}{2}$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1-3}{2}$</span>
.</p>
<p>These reduce to <span class='clFormula'>$x = 2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x = - 1$</span>
, respectively. Notice that these are the same values that when found when we solved for roots graphically.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Find the roots of the quadratic function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$</span>
. Solve graphically and algebraically.</p>



<a href='../images/0607.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0607.png' alt='The graph of .'></a>

<div><b><i>The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$</span>
.</i></b></div>
<p>The graph of the above function, with the vertex labeled at <span class='clFormula'>$(2, 1)$</span>
.</p>

<p>Looking at the graph of the function, we notice that it does not intersect the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. Therefore, it has <em>no real roots</em>.</p>
<p>We can verify this algebraically. First, identify the values for the coefficients: <span class='clFormula'>$a = 1$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b = - 4$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c = 5$</span>
.</p>
<p>Substituting these into the quadratic formula, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt {(-4)^2-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$</div>

<p>Simplifying, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{4 \pm \sqrt {16-20}}{2} \\&#10;x=\dfrac{4 \pm \sqrt {-4}}{2}$</div>

<p>Notice that we have <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{-4}$</span>
in the formula, which is not a real number. Therefore, there are <em>no real roots </em>for the given quadratic function. We have arrived at the same conclusion that we reached graphically.</p>

<blockquote>The vertex form of a quadratic function lets its vertex be found easily.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain the meanings of the constants <equation>$a$</equation>, <equation>$h$</equation>, and <equation>$k$</equation> for a quadratic equation in vertex form</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An important form of a quadratic function is vertex form: <span class='clFormula'>$f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$</span></li>
<li>When written in vertex form, it is easy to see the vertex of the parabola at <span class='clFormula'>$(h, k)$</span>
.</li>
<li>It is easy to convert from vertex form to standard form.</li>
<li>It is more difficult, but still possible, to convert from standard form to vertex form. The process involves a technique called completing the square. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>

<dt>vertex</dt>
<dd>A point on the curve with a local minimum or maximum of curvature.</dd>
<dt>quadratic</dt>
<dd>A polynomial of degree two.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quadratic equations may take various forms. You have already seen the standard form: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x)=a{ x }^{ 2 }+bx+c$</div>

<p>Another common form is called vertex form, because when a quadratic is written in this form, it is very easy to tell where its vertex is located. The vertex form is given by:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$</span></p>
<p>The vertex is <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k).$</span>
 Note that if the form were <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=a(x+h)^2+k$</span>
, the vertex would be  <span class='clFormula'>$(-h,k).$</span>
 The coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 as before controls whether the parabola opens upward or downward, as well as the speed of increase or decrease of the parabola. </p>

<h3>Converting From Vertex Form to Standard Form</h3>

<p>If you want to convert a quadratic in vertex form to one in standard form, simply multiply out the square and combine like terms. For example, the quadratic</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$y=(x-2)^2+1$</span>
 </p>
<p>Can be rewritten as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} y&amp;=(x-2)(x-2)+1 \\ &amp;=x^2-2x-2x+4+1 \\ &amp;=x^2-4x+5 \end{align}$</div>


<h3>Converting From Standard Form to Vertex Form </h3>

<p>It is more difficult to convert from standard form to vertex form. The process is called "completing the square."  </p>

<h3>Conversion When <span class='clFormula'>$a=1$</span></h3>

<p>Consider the following example: suppose you want to write <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2+4x+6$</span>
 in vertex form. Note that the coefficient on <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
(the one we call <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
) is <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. When this is the case, we look at the coefficient on <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 (the one we call <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) and take half of it. Then we square that number. Thus for this example, we divide <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 by <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 to obtain <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 and then square it to obtain <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
. </p>
<p>We then both add and subtract this number as follows: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y=(x^2+4x+4)+6-4$</div>

<p>Note that we both added and subtracted 4, so we didn't actually change our function. Now the expression in the parentheses is a square; we can write <span class='clFormula'>$y=(x+2)^2+2.$</span>
 Our equation is now in vertex form and we can see that the vertex is <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,2).$</span>
 </p>

<h3>Conversion When <span class='clFormula'>$a \neq 1$</span></h3>

<p>It is slightly more complicated to convert standard form to vertex form when the coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is not equal to <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. We can still use the technique, but must be careful to first factor out the <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 as in the following example: </p>
<p>Consider <span class='clFormula'>$y=2x^2+12x+5. $</span>
 We factor out the coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 from the first two terms, writing this as:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$y=2(x^2+6x) + 5$</span>
 </p>
<p>We then complete the square within the parentheses. Note that half of <span class='clFormula'>$6$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$3^2=9$</span>
. So we add and subtract <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
 within the parentheses, obtaining:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$y=2(x^2+6x+9-9)+5$</span>
 </p>
<p>We can then finish the calculation as follows:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} y&amp;=2((x+3)^2-9)+5 \\ &amp;=2(x+3)^2-18+5 \\ &amp;=(x+3)^2-13 \end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>So the vertex of this parabola is <span class='clFormula'>$(-3,-13).$</span></p>

<p>The graph of any quadratic equation is always a parabola.</p>


<h3>Coefficients and Graphs of Quadratic Function</h3>

<p>Each coefficient in a quadratic function in standard form has an impact on the shape and placement of the function's graph. </p>

<h3>Coefficient of <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span></h3>

<p>
The coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
controls the speed of increase (or decrease) of the quadratic function from the vertex. A larger, positive <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
makes the function increase faster and the graph appear thinner.</p>



<a href='../images/0609.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0609.png' alt='The coefficient  controls the speed of increase of the parabola.'></a>

<div><b><i>The coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>

<p>The black curve is <span class='clFormula'>$y=4x^2$</span>
 while the blue curve is <span class='clFormula'>$y=3x^2.$</span>
 The black curve appears thinner because its coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is bigger than that of the blue curve. </p>

<p>Whether the parabola opens upward or downward is also controlled by <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
. If the coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a&gt;0$</span>
, the parabola opens upward, and if the coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$a&lt;0$</span>
, the parabola opens downward.</p>



<a href='../images/0610.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0610.png' alt='Quadratics either open upward or downward'></a>

<div><b><i>Quadratics either open upward or downward</i></b></div>
<p>The blue parabola is the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=3x^2.$</span>
 It opens upward since <span class='clFormula'>$a=3&gt;0.$</span>
 The black parabola is the graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=-3x^2.$</span>
 It opens downward since <span class='clFormula'>$a=-3&lt;0.$</span></p>

<h3>The Axis of Symmetry</h3>

<p>The coefficients <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
together control the axis of symmetry of the parabola and the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate of the vertex. The axis of symmetry for a parabola is given by:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$</span>
 </p>
<p>For example, consider the parabola <span class='clFormula'>$y=2x^2-4x+4 $</span>
 shown below. Because <span class='clFormula'>$a=2$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b=-4,$</span>
 the axis of symmetry is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x=-\frac{-4}{2\cdot 2} = 1$</span></p>
<p>The vertex also has <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0611.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0611.png' alt='The graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2x^2-4x+4.$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The axis of symmetry is a vertical line parallel to the y-axis at  <span class='clFormula'>$x=1$</span>
.</p>

<h3>The <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept of the Parabola</h3>

<p>The coefficient <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
controls the height of the parabola. More specifically, it is the point where the parabola intercepts the y-axis. The point <span class='clFormula'>$(0,c)$</span>
 is the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 intercept of the parabola. Note that the parabola above has <span class='clFormula'>$c=4$</span>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the factors of a quadratic equation to solve it without using the quadratic formula</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree. A general quadratic equation can be written in the form: <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$</span>
.</li>
<li>One way to solve a quadratic equation is to factor the polynomial. This is essentially the reverse process of multiplying out two binomials with the FOIL method. </li>

<dd>To find all the mathematical objects that divide a mathematical object evenly.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To factor an expression means to rewrite it so that it is the product of factors. For example, the expression <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-7x+12$</span>
 can be written as <span class='clFormula'>$(x-3)(x-4)$</span>
. </p>
<p>When we multiply <span class='clFormula'>$(x-3)$</span>
 times <span class='clFormula'>$(x-4)$</span>
 to obtain <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-7x+12$</span>
 we call that operation "multiplying out" or sometimes FOILing. (Recall that FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, which is how we combine the terms.) The reverse process is called factoring. </p>

<h3>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</h3>

<p>Factoring is useful to help solve an equation of the form:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to solve the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-7x+12=0$</span>
, if you could realize that the quadratic factors as <span class='clFormula'>$(x-3)(x-4)$</span>
.</p>
<p> You could then rewrite your equation as <span class='clFormula'>$(x-3)(x-4)=0 $</span>
 and conclude that the two solutions are <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$x=4$</span>
. </p>
<p>This follows because the only way that two things can multiply together to be <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
 is if one or the other is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. So the expression <span class='clFormula'>$(x-3)(x-4)=0$</span>
 tells us that either <span class='clFormula'>$x-3=0$</span>
, in which case <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$x-4=0$</span>
, in which case <span class='clFormula'>$x=4.$</span></p>

<h3>Determining the Factors</h3>

<p>You may be wondering: but how does one come up with the two factors? Let's consider this same example more extensively.</p>
<p> Again, imagine you want to factor <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-7x+12$</span>
. First  set up the desired format: <span class='clFormula'>$( \quad )( \quad )$</span></p>
<p>Now lets look at how to fill in the variable slots in this format. The first two terms in each set of parentheses must multiply together to be <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
. So we write  <span class='clFormula'>$(x \quad )(x \quad )=0$</span>
. </p>
<p>Next we think about the fact that the last two terms must multiply together to be <span class='clFormula'>$12.$</span>
 We consider the following possibilities for how two numbers could multiply together to be <span class='clFormula'>$12,$</span>
 namely <span class='clFormula'>$12 \cdot 1, 6 \cdot 2,$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$ 4 \cdot 3.$</span>
 </p>
<p>Of these possibilities, the ones that add to be <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
 (the middle coefficient) are <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
. Since we are trying to get negative <span class='clFormula'>$7x$</span>
 in the middle, we try <span class='clFormula'>$(x-4)(x-3)$</span>
. FOILing gives exactly what we want, namely:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}(x-4)(x-3)&amp;= x^2-3x-4x+12 \\ &amp;=x^2-7x+12 \end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Note that we can  (and should) check that <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 are solutions to the original equation <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-7x+12=0.$</span>
 </p>

<h3>Another Example</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to solve:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x^2+2x-8=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>We attempt to factor the quadratic. We would need factors of <span class='clFormula'>$-8$</span>
which also add together to be <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. It seems as though <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
 might work, so we try factoring this as <span class='clFormula'>$(x-2)(x+4).$</span>
 </p>
<p>FOILing shows us that this is correct:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} (x-2)(x+4) &amp;= x^2 +4x-2x-8 \\ &amp;= x^2 +2x-8 \end{align}$</div>

<p> Thus we have <span class='clFormula'>$(x-2)(x+4)=0,$</span>
 so either <span class='clFormula'>$x-2=0$</span>
 in which case <span class='clFormula'>$x=2,$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$x+4=0,$</span>
 in which case <span class='clFormula'>$x=-4.$</span>
 We check our work by plugging both of these numbers back into the original equation and seeing that the equation is satisfied. </p>

<h3 id='concept_72'>6.3.2. Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials</h3>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Some quadratics, known as perfect squares, can be factored into two equal binomials.</li>
<li>Perfect squares have the form <span class='clFormula'>$a^2+2ab+b^2$</span>

<h3>Recognizing Perfect Square Trinomials</h3>

<p>Note that if a binomial of the form <span class='clFormula'>$a+b$</span>
 is squared, the result has the following form: <span class='clFormula'>$(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+2ab+b^2.$</span>
 So both the first and last term are squares, and the middle term has factors of <span class='clFormula'>$2, $</span><span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$b,$</span>
 where the latter are the square roots of the first and last term respectively. </p>
<p>For example, if the expression <span class='clFormula'>$2x+3$</span>
 were squared, we would obtain <span class='clFormula'>$(2x+3)(2x+3)=4x^2+12x+9.$</span>
 Note that the first term <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2$</span>
 is the square of <span class='clFormula'>$2x$</span>
 while the last term <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
 is the square of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, while the middle term is twice  <span class='clFormula'>$2x\cdot3$</span>
.</p>
<p>It is important to be able to recognize such trinomials, so that they can the be factored as a perfect square. </p>

<h3>Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials</h3>

<p>If you are attempting to to factor a trinomial and realize that it is a perfect square, the factoring becomes much easier to do. </p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Suppose you were trying to factor <span class='clFormula'>$x^2+8x+16.$</span>
 One can see that the first term is the square of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 while the last term is the square of <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
. Since the middle term is twice <span class='clFormula'>$4 \cdot x$</span>
, this must be a perfect square trinomial, and we can factor it as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2+8x+16=(x+4)^2$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Suppose you were trying to solve <span class='clFormula'>$9x^2+6x+1=0.$</span>
 You might try to factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side of the equation. Since the first term is <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
 squared, the last term is one squared, and the middle term is twice <span class='clFormula'>$3x\cdot 1$</span>
, this is a perfect square, and we can write:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$9x^2+6x+1=(3x+1)^2$</span>
 </p>
<p>Thus the original equation has the form <span class='clFormula'>$(3x+1)^2=0$</span>
, so the only solution is when <span class='clFormula'>$3x+1=0$</span>
, which is when <span class='clFormula'>$3x=-1,$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$x=-\frac{1}{3}. $</span>
 This quadratic equation has only that one solution.</p>

<h3 id='concept_74'>6.3.3. Factoring a Difference of Squares</h3>

<blockquote>When a quadratic is a difference of squares, there is a helpful formula for factoring it.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Determine whether a quadratic equation is a difference of squares and factor it accordingly if it is.</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>We can factor <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-y^2$</span>
, the difference of two squar<span class='clFormula'>$$</span>
es, as <span class='clFormula'>$(x-y)(x+y).$</span></li>
<li>It is useful to be able to spot these kinds of quadratics so that they can be factored quickly and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>binomial</dt>
<dd>A polynomial consisting of two terms, or monomials, separated by addition or subtraction symbols.</dd>
<dt>square</dt>
<dd>The second power of a number, value, term or expression.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When we multiply together the two binomials <span class='clFormula'>$(x-y)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(x+y)$</span>
, we obtain the product <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-y^2.$</span>
Usually when we multiply two binomials we obtain a trinomial, but in this case, when we FOIL, the outer and inner terms cancel. When we recall this fact in the reverse direction, it is called the difference of squares formula:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-y^2=(x-y)(x+y)$</span></p>
<p>
Another way to think about this formula is to consider trying to solve the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x^2=a^2$</span>
 for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. Taking the square root of both sides of the equation gives the answer <span class='clFormula'>$x = \pm a$</span>
. </p>
<p>But <span class='clFormula'>$x^2 = a^2$</span>
can also be solved by rewriting the equation as <span class='clFormula'>$x^2-a^2=0$</span>
 and factoring the difference of squares. From this, you would obtain:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(x-a)(x+a)=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>Thus  there are two solutions, where <span class='clFormula'>$x-a=0$</span>
 (<span class='clFormula'>$x=a$</span>
) and where <span class='clFormula'>$x+a=0$</span>
, (<span class='clFormula'>$x=-a$</span>
); the same as above. Using the difference of squares is just another way to think about solving the equation.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Suppose you were trying to factor the quadratic expression: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$x^2-16$</span>
 </p>
<p>If you recognize the first term as the square of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and the term after the minus sign as the square of <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
, you can then factor the expression as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(x-4)(x+4)$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Suppose you were trying to solve the equation: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$16x^4=9$</span>
 </p>
<p>We could write this as: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$16x^4-9=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>If we recognize the first term as the square of <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2$</span>
 and the term after the minus sign as the square of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, we can rewrite the equation as:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$(4x^2-3)(4x^2+3)=0$</span>
 </p>
<p>This means that either <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2-3=0$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2+3=0$</span>
. This latter equation has no solutions, since <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2$</span>
 is always greater than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0.$</span>
 However, the first equation <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2-3=0$</span>
 can be factored again as the difference of squares, if we consider <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 as the square of <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt3$</span>
. </p>
<p>Thus we have <span class='clFormula'>$(2x-\sqrt3)(2x+\sqrt3)=0.$</span>
 </p>
<p>Our two solutions occur where <span class='clFormula'>$2x-\sqrt3=0$</span>
 (which is at <span class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$</span>
), and where <span class='clFormula'>$2x+\sqrt3=0$</span>
 (which is at <span class='clFormula'>$x=-\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$</span>
).</p>

<h3 id='concept_73'>6.3.4. Factoring General Quadratics</h3>

<blockquote>Polynomials of the form <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c$</span>
 can be factored via the trial and error method.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Employ techniques to see whether a general quadratic equation can be factored</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Quadratic polynomials can often be factored with the trial and error method</li>
<li>The first step in factoring is often to look for factors of the first and last terms. Our goal is to choose the proper combination of factors for the first and last terms such that they yield the middle term.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dd>Of or relating to a class of polynomial of the form <equation>$y=ax+b$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>We can  factor quadratic equations of the form <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2 + bx + c$</span>
by first finding the factors of the constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
.  The factored form of a quadratic equation takes the general form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(\alpha_1 x + \beta_1)(\alpha_2 x + \beta_2)$</div>

<p>When <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is equal to one, <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_2$</span>
both equal one, and <span class='clFormula'>$\beta_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\beta_2$</span>
are factors of the constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
 such that:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$b = \beta_1 + \beta_2$</div>

<p>When <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is not equal to one and not equal to zero, you can FOIL the above expression for the factored form of the quadratic to find that 
<span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_2$</span>
are factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 such that:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$a=\alpha_1 \alpha_2$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b = \alpha_1 \beta_2 + \alpha_2 \beta_1$</span></p>
<p>In other words, the coefficient of the <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
term is given by the product of the coefficients <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_2$</span>
, and the coefficient of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
term is given by the inner and outer parts of the FOIL process.</p>
<p>In some cases, it will be impossible to factor the quadratic such that
<span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\alpha_2$</span>
are integers. </p>

<h3>Example: <span class='clFormula'>$a=1$</span></h3>

<p>Let the quadratic equation be:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-4x + x^2 - 21$</div>

<p>To factor this, we have to arrange the quadratic equation in order of largest exponent value to smallest exponent value.  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2-4x-21$</div>

<p>Next, we identify the constants <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, which in this case are <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$-21$</span>
, respectively.  </p>
<p>Then we list the possible pairs of factors of the constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, which yields the sets 1 and -21, -1 and 21, 3 and -7, and -3 and 7. Next we need to find the factored set of values that add to equal the value of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
.  In this case, the correct values are 3 and -7, since they add to equal <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
.  This leads to the factored form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2 - 4x - 21 = (x - 7)(x + 3)$</div>


<h3>Example: <span class='clFormula'>$a \neq 1$</span></h3>

<p>Let the quadratic equation be:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$6x^2+16x+8$</div>

<p>First, we factor <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, which has one pair of factors 3 and 2. Then we factor the constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, which has one pair of factors 2 and 4. Using these factored sets, we assemble the final factored form of the quadratic </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$(\alpha_1 x + \beta_1)(\alpha_2 x + \beta_2)$</span>
 </p>
<p>Such that <span class='clFormula'>$b = \alpha_1 \beta_2 + \alpha_2 \beta_1$</span>
.  This leads to the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(3x +2)(2x+4)$</div>


<h3 id='concept_128'>6.3.5. Completing the Square</h3>

<blockquote>Completing the square is a method for solving quadratic equations, and involves putting the quadratic in the form <span class='clFormula'>$0=a(x-h)^2 + k$</span>
.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve for the zeros of a quadratic function by completing the square</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Quadratics can be put in the form <span class='clFormula'>$a(x-h)^2 + k$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
are constants specific to a given quadratic.</li>
<li>Once a quadratic polynomial is in the form: <span class='clFormula'>$0=a(x-h)^2+k$</span>
, one can solve for two values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
(using the positive and negative square roots).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>quadratic equation</dt>
<dd>A polynomial equation of the second degree.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Along with factoring and using the quadratic formula, completing the square is a common method for solving quadratic equations.  It is often implemented when factoring is not an option, such as when the quadratic is a not already a perfect square.</p>
<p>Consider the formula for a generic quadratic equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=ax^2+bx+c$</div>

<p>The method of completing the square allows for the conversion to the form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0=a(x-h)^2+k$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
 are constants with a specific value. </p>
<p>The value of <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
is meant to adjust the function to compensate for the difference between the expanded form of <span class='clFormula'>$a(x-h)^2$</span>
and the general quadratic function <span class='clFormula'>$ax^2+bx+c$</span>
.  This adjustment is what mathematically allows for the two forms to be equal.</p>
<p>Once completing the square has been performed, the quadratic is easy to solve; because there is only one place where the variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is squared, the <span class='clFormula'>$(x-h)^2$</span>
 term can be isolated on one side of the equation, and then the square root of both sides can be taken.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>As an example, consider the following quadratic polynomial:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>${ x }^{ 2 }+10x+22$</div>

<p>This quadratic is not a perfect square.  The closest perfect square is the square of <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
, which was determined by dividing the <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 term (in this case <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
) by two and producing the square of the result.  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>${ { (x+5) }^{ 2 }=x }^{ 2 }+10x+25$</div>

<p>However, it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} { x }^{ 2 }+10x+22 &amp;= x^2 + 10x + 25 - 3 \\ &amp;= (x+5)^2 - 3 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Thus, the constant <span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
takes the value <span class='clFormula'>$-5$</span>
 and the constant <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
takes the value <span class='clFormula'>$-3$</span>
.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we can now solve for x:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} (x+5)^2-3&amp; =0 \\ (x+5)^2 &amp;=3 \\ x+5&amp;=\pm \sqrt 3\\ x&amp;= \pm \sqrt 3 -5\end{align}$</div>

<h3 id='concept_132'>6.4.1. Scientific Applications of Quadratic Functions</h3>

<blockquote>Quadratic relationships between variables are commonly found in physical sciences, engineering, and elsewhere.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the quadratic equation to model phenomena studied in science</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Pythagorean Theorem, <span class='clFormula'>$c^2=a^2+b^2$</span>
relates the length of the hypotenuse (<span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
) of a right triangle to the lengths of its legs (<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
).</li>
<li>Problems involving gravity and projectile motion are typically dependent upon a second-order variable, usually time or initial velocity depending on the relationship.</li>
<li>Coulomb's Law, which relates electrostatic force, charge amount and distance between two charged particles, has a second-order dependence on the separation of the particles. Solving for either charge results in a quadratic function.</li>
</ul>

<dt>velocity</dt>
<dd>A vector quantity that denotes the rate of change of position with respect to time, or a speed with the directional component.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quadratic relationships between variables are commonly found in physical sciences, engineering, and elsewhere. Perhaps the most universally used example of quadratic relationships in problem solving concerns right triangles.</p>

<h3>The Pythagorean Theorem</h3>

<p>The Pythagorean Theorem is used to relate the three sides of right triangles. It states:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$c^2=a^2+b^2$</div>

<p>This says that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (<span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
) is equal to the sum of the squares of the two legs (<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) of the triangle. This has been proven in many ways, among the most famous of which was devised by Euclid.  </p>
<p>In practice, the Pythagorean Theorem is often solved via factoring or completing the square.  If any of the variables <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
 represent functions in themselves, it is often useful to expand the terms, combine like variables, and then re-factor the expression.  </p>

<h3>Gravity and Projectile Motion</h3>

<p>Most all equations involving gravity include a second-order relationship. </p>

<h3>Gravitational Force</h3>

<p>Consider the equation relating gravitational force (<span class='clFormula'>$F$</span>
) between two objects to the masses of each object (<span class='clFormula'>$m_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$m_2$</span>
) and the distance between them (<span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$F=G\dfrac {m_1m_2}{r^2}$</div>

<p>The shape of this function is not a parabola, but becomes such a shape if rearranged to solve for <span class='clFormula'>$m_1$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$m_2$</span>
, as seen below:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$m_2 = \frac{Fr^2}{Gm_1} = (\frac{F}{Gm_1}) r^2$</div>

<p>The general form of this function is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a(x-h)^2 + k$</div>

<p>which you should recognize as the vertex form of a quadratic equation.</p>

<h3>Projectile Motion</h3>

<p>The maximum height of a projectile launched directly upwards can also be calculated from a quadratic relationship. The formula relates height (<span class='clFormula'>$h$</span>
) to initial velocity (<span class='clFormula'>$v_0$</span>
) and gravitational acceleration (<span class='clFormula'>$g$</span>
):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$h=\frac {v_0^2}{2g}$</div>

<p>The same maximum height of a projectile launched directly upwards can be found using the time at the projectile's peak (<span class='clFormula'>$t_h$</span>
):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$h=v_0t_h(\frac {1}{2})gt_h^2$</div>

<p>Substituting any time (<span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
) in place of <span class='clFormula'>$t_h$</span>
leaves the equation for height as a quadratic function of time.</p>

<h3>Electrostatic Force</h3>

<p>The equation relating electrostatic force (<span class='clFormula'>$F$</span>
) between two particles, the particles' respective charges (<span class='clFormula'>$q_1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$q_2$</span>
), and the distance between them (<span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
) is very similar to the aforementioned formula for gravitational force:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$F=\frac {q_1q_2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r^2}$</div>

<p>This is known as Coulomb's Law. Solving for either charge results in a quadratic equation where the charge is dependent on <span class='clFormula'>$r^2$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_135'>6.4.2. Financial Applications of Quadratic Functions</h3>

<blockquote>For problems involving quadratics in finance, it is useful to graph the equation. From these, one can easily find critical values of the function by inspection.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Apply the quadratic function to real world financial models</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>In some financial math problems, several key points on a quadratic function are desired, so it can become tedious to calculate each algebraically.</li>
<li>Rather than calculating each key point of a function, one can find these values by inspection of its graph.</li>
<li>Graphs of quadratic functions can be used to find key points in many different relationships, from finance to science and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method of graphing a function to determine general properties can be used to solve financial problems.Given the algebraic equation for a quadratic function, one can calculate any point on the function, including critical values like minimum/maximum and x- and y-intercepts.</p>
<p>These calculations can be more tedious than is necessary, however. A graph contains all the above critical points and more, and acts as a clear and concise representation of a function. If one needs to determine several values on a quadratic function, glancing at a graph is quicker than calculating several points.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the function: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$F(x)=-\frac {x^2}{10}+50x-750$</div>

<p>Suppose this models a profit function <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
 in dollars that a company earns as a function of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
number of products  of a given type that are sold, and is valid for values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
greater than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
 and less than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$500$</span>
.</p>
<p>If a financier wanted to find the number of sales required to break even, the maximum possible loss (and the number of sales required for this loss), and the maximum profit (and the number of sales required for this profit), they could simply reference a graph instead of calculating it out algebraically.</p>



<a href='../images/0612.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0612.png' alt='Financial example'></a>

<div><b><i>Financial example</i></b></div>
<p>Graph of the equation <span class='clFormula'>$F(x) = -\frac{x^2}{10} + 50x - 750$</span>
, where the x-axis is number of sales, and the y-axis is the monetary return. A parabola opening down, with positive roots and a vertex at about (250, 5500).</p>

<p>By inspection, we can find that
the break-even points (<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercepts) are between <span class='clFormula'>$15$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$16$</span>
sales, and between <span class='clFormula'>$484$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$485$</span>
sales. The maximum loss before the second break-even points is \$750 (the y-intercept), which is lost at <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
sales. After the second break-even point, the function decreases to infinity, so the losses continue to increase. Maximum profit is \$5500 (the vertex), which is achieved at <span class='clFormula'>$250$</span>
sales.</p>
