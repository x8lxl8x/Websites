<h3>The Four Arithmetic Operations</h3>

<h3>Addition</h3>

<p>Addition is the most basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two quantities into a single quantity, or sum. For example, say you have a group of 2 boxes and another group of 3 boxes. If you combine both groups together, you now have one group of 5 boxes. To represent this idea in mathematical terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2+3=5$</div>




<h3>Subtraction</h3>

<p>
Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Instead of adding quantities together, we are removing one quantity from another to find the difference between the two. Continuing the previous example, say you start with a group of 5 boxes. If you then remove 3 boxes from that group, you are left with 2 boxes. In mathematical terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$5-3=2$</div>


<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>
Multiplication also combines multiple quantities into a single quantity, called the product. In fact, multiplication can be thought of as a consolidation of many additions. Specifically, the product of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
is the result of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
added together <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
times. For example, one way of counting four groups of two boxes is to add the groups together:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2+2+2+2=8$</div>

<p>However, another way to count the boxes is to multiply the quantities:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2 \cdot 4 = 8$</div>

<p>Note that both methods give you the same result—8—but in many cases, particularly when you have large quantities or many groups, multiplying can be much faster.</p>

<h3>Division </h3>

<p>
Division is the inverse of multiplication. Rather than multiplying quantities together to result in a larger value, you are splitting a quantity into a smaller value, called the quotient. Again, to return to the box example, splitting up a group of 8 boxes into 4 equal groups results in 4 groups of 2 boxes:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$8 \div 4 = 2$</div>




<h3>The Basic Arithmetic Properties</h3>




<h3>
Commutative Property
</h3>

<p>The commutative property describes equations in which  the <em>order</em> of the numbers involved does not affect the result. Addition and multiplication are commutative operations:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2+3=3+2=5$</div>
<div class='clFormula'>$5 \cdot 2=2 \cdot 5=10$</div>

<p>Subtraction and division, however, are not commutative.</p>

<h3>Associative Property</h3>

<p>The associative property describes equations in which the <em>grouping </em>of the numbers involved does not affect the result. As with the commutative property, addition and multiplication are associative operations:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2+3)+6=2+(3+6)=11$</div>
<div class='clFormula'>$(4 \cdot 1) \cdot 2=4 \cdot (1 \cdot 2)=8$</div>

<p>Once again, subtraction and division are not associative.</p>

<h3>Distributive Property</h3>

<p>The distributive property can be used when the sum of two quantities is then multiplied by a third quantity. </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2+4) \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3+4\cdot 3 = 18$</div>

<h3 id='concept_362'>1.1.2. Negative Numbers</h3>

<blockquote>Arithmetic operations can be performed on negative numbers according to specific rules.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of negative whole numbers</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The addition of two negative numbers results in a negative; the addition of a positive and negative number produces a number that has the same sign as the number of larger magnitude. </li>
<li>Subtraction of a positive number yields the same result
as the addition of a negative number of equal magnitude, while subtracting a negative number yields the same result as adding a positive number.</li>
<li>The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative, and the product of two negative numbers is positive.</li>
<li>The quotient of one positive number and one negative number is negative, and the quotient of two negative numbers is positive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Four Operations</h3>

<h3>Addition</h3>

<p>The addition of two negative numbers is very similar to the addition of two positive numbers. For example:</p>



<div class='clFormula'>$(-3) + (-5)  =  -8$</div>



<p>The underlying principle is that two debts—negative numbers— can be combined into a single debt of greater magnitude.</p>


<p>When adding together a mixture of positive and negative numbers, another way to write the negative numbers is as positive quantities being
subtracted. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$8 + (-3)  =  8 - 3  =  5$</div>



<p>Here, a credit of 8 is combined with a debt of 3, which yields a total credit of 5. However, if the negative number has greater magnitude, then the result is negative:</p>



<div class='clFormula'>$(-8) + 3  =  3 - 8  =  -5 $</div>

<p>Similarly:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-2) + 7  =  7 - 2  =  5$</div>

<p>Here, a debt of 2 is combined with a credit of 7. The credit has greater magnitude than the debt, so the result is positive. But if the credit is less than the debt, the result is negative:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$2 + (-7)  =  2 - 7  =  -5$</span></p>



<h3>Subtraction</h3>

<p> Subtracting positive numbers from each other can  yield a negative answer. For example, subtracting 8 from 5:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$5 - 8  =  -3&#10;$</div>







<p>Subtracting  a positive number is generally the same as adding the negative of that number. That is to say:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$5 - 8  =  5 + (-8)  =  -3&#10;$</div>







<p>and</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-3) - 5  =  (-3) + (-5)  =  -8$</div>







<p>Similarly, <em>subtracting</em> a negative number yields the same
result as <em>adding</em> the positive of that number. The idea here  is that <em>losing</em> a debt is the same thing as <em>gaining</em> a credit. Therefore:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3 - (-5)  =  3 + 5  =  8&#10;$</div>







<p>and</p>



<div class='clFormula'>$(-5) - (-8)  =  (-5) + 8  =  3$</div>


<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>When multiplying positive and negative numbers, the sign of the product is determined by the following rules:</p>




<ul>
<li>The product of two positive numbers is positive.The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative.</li>
<li>The product of two negative numbers is positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-2)  3  =  -6&#10;$</div>

<p>This is simply because adding −2 together three times yields −6:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-2)  3  =  (-2) + (-2) + (-2)  =  -6$</div>

<p>However,</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-2)  (-3)  =  6$</div>

<p>
The idea
again here is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit. In
this case, losing two debts of three each is the same as gaining a
credit of six:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\left (-2\text{ debts } \right ) \times \left ( -3 \text{ each} \right )  =  +6\text{ credit}$</span></p>





<h3>Division</h3>

<p>The sign rules for division are the same as for multiplication. </p>
<ul>
<li>Dividing two positive numbers yields a positive number.</li>
<li>Dividing one positive number and one negative number yields a negative number.</li>
<li>Dividing two negative numbers yields a positive number.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dividend and the divisor have the same sign, that is to say, the result is always positive. For example:</p>



<div class='clFormula'>$8  (-2)  =  -4$</div>

<p>and</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-8)  2  =  -4$</div>



<p>but</p>


<p>
<span class='clFormula'>$(-8)  (-2)  =  4$</span>
.
</p>



<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

<p>The basic properties of addition (commutative, associative, and distributive) also apply to negative numbers. For example, the following equation demonstrates the distributive property: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-3(2 + 5) = (-3)\cdot 2 + (-3)\cdot 5 $</div>


<h3 id='concept_263'>1.1.3. Fractions</h3>

<blockquote>A fraction represents a part of a whole and consists of an integer numerator and a non-zero integer denominator.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the result of operations on fractions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Addition and subtraction of fractions require "like quantities"—a common denominator. To add or subtract fractions containing unlike quantities (e.g. adding quarters to thirds), it is necessary to convert all amounts to like quantities.</li>
<li>Multiplication of fractions requires multiplying the numerators by each other and then the denominators by each other. A shortcut is to use the cancellation strategy, which reduces the numbers to the smallest possible values prior to multiplication.</li>
<li>Division of fractions involves multiplying the first number by the reciprocal of the second number.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>fraction</dt>
<dd>A ratio of two numbers—a numerator and a denominator—usually written one above the other and separated by a horizontal bar.</dd>
<dt>reciprocal</dt>
<dd>A fraction that is turned upside down so that the numerator and denominator have switched places.</dd>
<dt>denominator</dt>
<dd>The number that sits below the fraction bar and represents the whole number.</dd>
<dt>numerator</dt>
<dd>The number that sits above the fraction bar and represents the part of the whole number.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A fraction represents a part of a whole. A common  fraction, such as <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{2}$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$ \frac{8}{5}$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{3}{4}$</span>
, consists of an integer numerator (the top number) and a non-zero integer denominator (the bottom number). The numerator represents a certain number of equal parts of the whole, and the denominator indicates how many of those parts are needed to make up one whole. An example can be seen in the following figure, in which a cake is divided into quarters:</p>



<a href='../images/0101.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0101.png' alt='Quarters of a cake'></a>

<div><b><i>Quarters of a cake</i></b></div>
<p>A cake with one-fourth removed. The remaining three-fourths are shown. Dotted lines indicate where the cake can be cut  to divide it into equal parts. Each remaining fourth of the cake is denoted by the fraction <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{4}$</span>
.</p>


<h3>Addition</h3>

<h3>Adding Like Quantities</h3>

<p>The first rule of adding fractions is to start by adding  fractions that contain like denominators—for example, multiple fourths, or quarters. A quarter is represented by the fraction  <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{4}$</span>
, where the numerator, 1, represents the single quarter and the denominator, 4, represents the number of quarters it takes to make a whole, or one dollar. </p>
<p>Imagine one pocket containing two quarters, and another pocket containing three quarters. In total, there are five quarters. Since four quarters is equivalent to one (dollar), this can be represented as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{2}{4}+\frac{3}{4}=\frac{5}{4}=1\frac{1}{4}$</div>


<h3>Adding Unlike Quantities</h3>

<p>To add fractions that contain <em>unlike</em> denominators (e.g. quarters and thirds), it is necessary to first convert all amounts to like quantities, which means all the fractions must have a common denominator. One easy way to to find a denominator that will give you like quantities is simply to multiply together the two denominators of the fractions. (It is important to remember that each numerator must also be multiplied by the same value its denominator is being multiplied by in order for the fraction to represent the same ratio.) </p>
<p>For example, to add quarters to thirds, both types of fractions are converted to twelfths:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac { 1 }{ 3 } +\frac { 1 }{ 4 } =\frac { 1\cdot 4 }{ 3\cdot4 } +\frac { 1\cdot3 }{ 4\cdot3 } =\frac { 4 }{ 12 } +\frac { 3 }{ 12 } =\frac { 7 }{ 12 }$</div>

<p>This method can be expressed algebraically as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+cd}{bd}$</div>

<p>This method always works. However, sometimes there is a faster way—a smaller denominator, or a least common denominator—that can be used. For example, to add <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{3}{4}$</span>
 to <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{5}{12}$</span>
, the denominator 48 (the product of 4 and 12, the two denominators) can be used—but the smaller denominator 12 (the least common multiple of 4 and 12) may also be used.</p>

<h3>Adding Fractions to Whole Numbers</h3>

<p>What if a fraction is being added to a whole number? Simply start by writing the whole number as a fraction (recall that a whole number has a denominator of <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
), and then continue with the above process for adding fractions.</p>

<h3>Subtraction</h3>

<p>The process for subtracting fractions is, in essence, the same as that for adding them. Find a common denominator, and change each fraction to an equivalent fraction using that common denominator. Then, subtract the numerators. For instance:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac { 2 }{ 3 } -\frac { 1 }{ 2 } =\frac { 2\cdot 2 }{ 3\cdot2 } -\frac { 1\cdot3 }{ 2\cdot3 } =\frac { 4 }{ 6 } -\frac { 3 }{ 6 } =\frac { 1 }{ 6 }$</div>

<p>To subtract a fraction from a whole number or to subtract a whole number from a fraction, rewrite the whole number as a fraction and then follow the above process for subtracting fractions. </p>

<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>Unlike with addition and subtraction, with multiplication the denominators are not required to be the same. To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators by each other and the denominators by each other.  For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{12}$</div>

<p>If any numerator and denominator shares a common factor, the fractions can be reduced  to lowest terms before or after multiplying. For example, the resulting fraction from above can be reduced to <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{2}$</span>
 because the numerator and denominator share a factor of  6. Alternatively, the fractions in the initial equation could have been reduced, as shown below, because 2 and 4 share a common factor of 2 and 3 and 3 share a common factor of 3:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{3}{4}=\frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}= \frac{1}{2}$</div>

<p>To multiply a fraction by a whole number, simply multiply that number by the numerator of the fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac {3}{4} \cdot 5= \frac {15}{4}$</div>

<p>A common situation where multiplying fractions comes in handy is during cooking. What if someone wanted to "half" a cookie recipe that called for <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1}{2}$</span>
 of a cup of chocolate chips? To find the proper amount of chocolate chips to use, multiply <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$</span>
. The result is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1}{4}$</span>
, so the proper amount of chocolate chips is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1}{4}$</span>
 of a cup.</p>

<h3>Division</h3>

<p> The process for dividing a number by a fraction entails multiplying the number by the fraction's reciprocal. The reciprocal is simply the fraction turned upside down such that the numerator and denominator switch places. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac { 1 }{ 2 } \div \frac { 3 }{ 4 } =\frac { 1 }{ 2 } \cdot \frac { 4 }{ 3 } =\frac { 4 }{ 6 } =\frac { 2 }{ 3 }$</div>



<p>To divide a fraction by a whole number, either divide the fraction's numerator by the whole number (if it divides simply):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac { 10 }{ 3 } \div 5= \frac{10 \div 2}{3} = \frac { 2 }{ 3 }$</div>

<p> or multiply the fraction's denominator by the whole number:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac { 10 }{ 3} \div 5 = \displaystyle \frac { 10 }{ 3\cdot5 } =\frac { 10 }{ 15 } =\frac { 2 }{ 3 }$</div>


<h3 id='concept_79'>1.1.4. Complex Fractions</h3>

<blockquote>A complex fraction is one in which the numerator, denominator, or both are fractions, which can contain variables, constants, or both.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Simplify complex fractions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Complex fractions include numbers such as <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {\left( \frac {8}{15}\right) }{\left( \frac {2}{3}\right)}$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$ \frac {3}{1-\frac{2}{5}}$</span>
, where the numerator, denominator, or both include fractions.</li>
<li>Before solving complex rational expressions, it is helpful to simplify them as much as possible. </li>
<li>The "combine-divide method" for simplifying complex fractions entails (1) combining the terms in the numerator, (2) combining the terms in the denominator, and finally (3) dividing the numerator by the denominator.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>complex fraction</dt>
<dd>A ratio in which the numerator, denominator, or both are themselves fractions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A complex fraction, also called a complex rational expression, is one in which the numerator, denominator, or both are fractions. For example,  <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {\left( \frac {8}{15}\right) }{\left( \frac {2}{3}\right)}$</span>
 and  <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {3}{1-\frac{2}{5}}$</span>
 are complex fractions. When dealing with equations that involve complex fractions, it is useful to simplify the complex fraction before solving the equation.
</p>
<p>The process of simplifying complex fractions, known as the "combine-divide method," is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Combine the terms in the numerator.</li>
<li>Combine the terms in the denominator.</li>
<li>Divide the numerator by the denominator.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Let's  apply this method to the first complex fraction presented above:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac {\left( \frac {8}{15}\right) }{\left( \frac {2}{3}\right)}}$</div>



<p>Since there are no terms that can be combined or simplified in either the numerator or denominator, we'll skip to Step 3, dividing the numerator by the denominator:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{ \frac {\left( \frac {8}{15}\right) }{\left( \frac {2}{3}\right)} = \frac {8}{15} \div \frac {2}{3}}$</div>

<p>From previous sections, we know that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction. Therefore, we use the cancellation method to simplify the numbers as much as possible, and then we multiply by the simplified reciprocal of the divisor, or denominator, fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle {{\frac 8{15}}\cdot {\frac 32} = {\frac 4{5}}\cdot{\frac 11} ={\frac 4{5}}}$</div>

<p>Therefore, the complex fraction <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {\left( \frac {8}{15}\right) }{\left( \frac {2}{3}\right)}$</span>
 simplifies to <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {4}{5}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Let's try another example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle {\frac {\left(\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{2}{3}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot\dfrac{3}{4}\right)}}$</div>



<p>Start with Step 1 of the combine-divide method above: combine the terms in the numerator. You'll find that the common denominator of the two fractions in the numerator is 6, and then you can add those two terms together to get a single fraction term in the larger fraction's numerator:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac {\left(\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{2}{3}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot\dfrac{3}{4}\right)} = \dfrac {\left(\dfrac{3}{6}+\dfrac{4}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot\dfrac{3}{4}\right)} = \dfrac {\left(\dfrac{7}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot\dfrac{3}{4}\right)}$</span></p>
<p> Let's move on to Step 2: combine the terms in the denominator. To do so, we multiply the fractions in the denominator together and simplify the result by reducing it to lowest terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac {\left(\dfrac{7}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot\dfrac{3}{4}\right)} = &#10;\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{7}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)} =&#10;\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{7}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}$</div>

<p>Let's turn to Step 3: divide the numerator by the denominator. Recall, again, that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\frac{\left(\dfrac{7}{6}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}=&#10;{\dfrac{7}{6}} \cdot {\dfrac{2}{1}} = &#10;\dfrac{14}{6}$</div>

<p>Finally, simplify the resultant fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{14}{6}=2\frac{2}{6}$</div>

<p>Therefore, ultimately:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\frac {\left(\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{2}{3}\right)}{ \left(\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot \dfrac{3}{4}\right)} =2\dfrac{2}{6}$</div>

<p>Exponentiation is a mathematical operation that represents repeated multiplication. The exponent <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 in the expression <span class='clFormula'>$b^n$</span>
 represents the number of times the base <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is multiplied by itself. </p>
<p>For example, the expression <span class='clFormula'>$b^3$</span>
 represents <span class='clFormula'>$b \cdot b \cdot b$</span>
. Here, the exponent is 3, and the expression can be read in any of the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
raised to the 3rd power</li>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
raised to the power of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
raised by the exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Some exponents have their own unique pronunciations. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$b^2$</span>
is usually read as "<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
squared" and <span class='clFormula'>$b^3$</span>
as "<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
cubed." </p>
<p>Exponentiation is used frequently in many fields, including economics, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, with applications such as compound interest, population growth, chemical reaction kinetics, wave behavior, and public key cryptography.</p>

<h3>Positive Integer Exponents</h3>

<p>Now that we understand the basic idea, let's practice simplifying some exponential expressions. </p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Let's look at an exponential expression with 2 as the base and 3 as the exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2^3$</div>

<p>This means that the base 2 gets multiplied by itself 3 times:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Let's look at another exponential expression, this time with 3 as the base and 5 as the exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^5$</div>

<p>This means that the base 3 gets multiplied by itself 5 times:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^5 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 243$</div>


<h3>Exponents of 0 and 1</h3>



<p>Any number raised by the exponent <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
is the number itself. That is to say, <span class='clFormula'>$b^1=b$</span>
.</p>


<p>Any nonzero number raised by the exponent 0 is 1. That is to say, <span class='clFormula'>$b^0=1$</span>
. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$4^0=1$</span>

<h3 id='concept_67'>1.1.6. The Order of Operations</h3>

<blockquote>The order of operations is an approach to evaluating expressions that involve  multiple arithmetic operations.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Differentiate between correct and incorrect uses of the order of operations</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The order of operations prevents ambiguity in mathematical expressions.</li>
<li>The order of operations is as follows: 1) simplify terms inside parentheses or brackets, 2) simplify exponents and roots, 3) perform multiplication and division, 4) perform addition and subtraction. </li>
<li>Multiplication and division are given equal priority, as are addition and subtraction. This means that multiplication and division operations (and similarly addition and subtraction operations) can be performed in the order in which they appear in the expression.
</li>
<li>A helpful mnemonic to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, sometimes expanded to "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>mathematical operation</dt>
<dd>An action or procedure that produces a new value from one or more input values.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The order of operations is a way of evaluating expressions that involve more than one arithmetic operation. These rules tell you how you should simplify or solve an expression or equation in the way that yields the correct output.</p>
<p>For example, when faced with the expression <span class='clFormula'>$4+2\cdot 3$</span>
, how do you proceed?</p>
<p>One option is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle 4+2\cdot3 &amp;= (4+2)\cdot 3&#10;\\&amp;= 6\cdot 3&#10;\\&amp;= 18&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The other option is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle 4+2 \cdot 3 &amp;= 4+(2\cdot 3)&#10;\\ &amp;= 4 + 6&#10;\\ &amp;= 10&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Which one is the correct order of operations?</p>
<p>In order to be able to communicate using mathematical expressions, we must have  an agreed-upon order of operations so that each expression is unambiguous. For the above expression, for example, all mathematicians would agree that the correct answer is 10.</p>
<p>The order of operations used throughout mathematics, science, technology, and many computer programming languages is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simplify terms inside parentheses or brackets</li>
<li>Simplify exponents and roots</li>
<li>Perform multiplication and division</li>
<li>Perform addition and subtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules means that within a mathematical expression, the operation ranking highest on the list should be performed first. Multiplication and division are of equal precedence (tier 3), as are addition and subtraction (tier 4). This means that multiplication and division operations (and similarly addition and subtraction operations) can be performed in the order in which they appear in the expression.
</p>
<p>Let's evaluate a few expressions using the order of operations. </p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$3^2-1\cdot4+2$</div>

<p>In this expression, the following operations are taking place: exponentiation, subtraction, multiplication, and addition. Following the order of operations, we simplify the exponent first and then perform the multiplication; next, we perform the subtraction, and then the addition:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle 3^2-1\cdot4+2 &amp;= 9-1\cdot4+2&#10;\\ &amp;= 9-4+2&#10;\\ &amp;= 5+2&#10;\\ &amp;= 7&#10;\end{align}&#10;$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$6-(5\cdot1)+2^3$</div>

<p>Here we have an expression that involves subtraction, parentheses, multiplication, addition, and exponentiation. Following the order of operations, we simplify the expression within the parentheses first and then simplify the exponent; next, we perform the subtraction and addition operations in the order in which they appear in the expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle 6-(5\cdot1)+2^3 &amp;= 6-5+2^3&#10;\\ &amp;= 6-5+8&#10;\\ &amp;= 1+8&#10;\\ &amp;= 9&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<h3>A Note on Equal Precedence</h3>

<p>Since multiplication and division are of equal precedence, it may be helpful to think of dividing by a number as multiplying by the reciprocal of that number. Thus <span class='clFormula'>$3 \div 4 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{4}$</span>
. In other words, the quotient of 3 and 4 equals the product of 3 and <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{4}$</span>
.</p>
<p>Similarly, as addition and subtraction are of equal precedence, we can think of subtracting a number as the same as adding the negative of that number. Thus <span class='clFormula'>$3-4=3+(-4)$</span>
. In other words, the difference of 3 and 4 equals the sum of positive three and negative four.</p>
<p>With this understanding, think of <span class='clFormula'>$1-3+7$</span>
as the sum of 1, negative 3, and 7, and then add these terms together. Now that you've reframed the operations, any order will work:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(1-3)+7=-2+7=5$</div>

<li> <span class='clFormula'>$(7-3)+1=4+1=5$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing is to keep the negative sign with any negative number (here, the 3).</p>

<h3>Mnemonics</h3>

<p>In the United States, the acronym PEMDAS is a common mnemonic for remembering the order of operations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. PEMDAS is often expanded to "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."</p>
<p>This mnemonic can be misleading, however, because the "MD" implies that multiplication must be performed before division and the "AS" that addition must be performed before subtraction, rather than acknowledging their equal precedence. To illustrate why this is a problem, consider the following:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$10-3+2$</div>

<p>This expression correctly simplifies to 9. However, if you were to add together 2 and 3 first, to give 5, and <em>then </em>performed the subtraction, you would get 5 as your final answer, which is incorrect. To avoid this mistake, is best to think of this problem as the sum of positive ten, negative three, and positive two.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$10+(-3)+2$</div>

<p>To avoid this confusion altogether, an alternative way to write the mnemonic is:</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>
E
</p>
<p>MD</p>
<p>AS</p>
<p>Or, simply as PEMA, where it is taught that multiplication and division inherently share the same precedence and that addition and subtraction inherently share the same precedence. This mnemonic makes the equivalence of multiplication and division and of addition and subtraction clear.</p>

<p>A "real interval" is a set of real numbers such that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set. For example, the set of all numbers <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
satisfying <span class='clFormula'>$0 \leq  x \leq  1$</span>
is an interval that contains 0 and 1, as well as all the numbers between them. Other examples of intervals include the set of all real numbers and the set of all negative real numbers.</p>
<p>The interval of numbers between <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>

, including <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, is often denoted <span class='clFormula'>$[a,b]$</span>
. The two numbers are called the <em>endpoints</em> of the interval. </p>

<h3>Open and Closed Intervals</h3>

<p>An <em>open interval</em> does not include its endpoints and is indicated with parentheses. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,1)$</span>
describes an interval greater than 0 and less than 1. </p>


<p>

<h3>Bounded and Unbounded Intervals</h3>

<p>An interval is said to be <em>bounded</em> if both of its endpoints are real numbers.
Bounded intervals are also commonly known as finite<em> intervals</em>. Conversely, if neither endpoint is a real number, the interval is said to be <em>unbounded</em>.
For example,
the interval <span class='clFormula'>$(1,10)$</span>
 is considered bounded; the interval  <span class='clFormula'>$(- \infty, + \infty)$</span>
 is considered unbounded.</p>


<p>
The set of all real numbers is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends; the empty set (the set containing no elements) is bounded.</p>
<p>
An interval that has only one real-number endpoint is said to be <em>half-bounded</em>, or more descriptively, <em>left-bounded</em> or <em>right-bounded.</em> For example, the interval <span class='clFormula'>$(1, + \infty)$</span>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Absolute value is closely related to the mathematical and physical concepts of magnitude, distance, and norm. The term "absolute value" has been used in this sense since at least 1806 in French and 1857 in English. The notation <span class='clFormula'>$\left | a \right |$</span>
was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841. Other names for absolute value include "numerical value," "modulus," and "magnitude."</p>

<h3 id='concept_62'>1.2.3. Sets of Numbers</h3>

<blockquote>A set is a collection of unique numbers, often denoted with curly brackets: {}.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use set notation to represent sets of numbers and describe the properties of commonly used sets of numbers</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A set is a collection of distinct objects and is considered an object in its own right. With numbers, a set is a collection of unique numbers, such as <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{  1, 2, 5, 8, 4 \right \}$</span>
.</li>
<li>In sets, the order of numbers doesn't matter; it is important only that no numbers are duplicated.</li>
<li>If every member of set A is also a member of set B, then A is said to be a subset of B, written <span class='clFormula'>$A \subseteq B$</span>
(also pronounced "A is contained in B"). Conversely,
<span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
 can be considered a superset of <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
. This is written  <span class='clFormula'>$B \supseteq  A$</span>
.</li>
<li>The common categories of number sets are natural numbers, real numbers, integers, rational numbers, imaginary numbers, and complex numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>superset</dt>
<dd>A set that contains another set.</dd>
<dt>set</dt>
<dd>A collection of unique objects, potentially infinite in size, that is not reliant on the order of the objects contained within it.</dd>
<dt>subset</dt>
<dd>A set that is also an element of another set.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. A set is a collection of distinct objects and is considered an object in its own right. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered together they form a single set of size three, written <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 2,4,6 \right \}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Defining a Set</h3>

<p>There are two ways of describing, or specifying the members of, a set. One way is through intentional definition, using a rule or semantic description. For example: "<span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is the set whose members are the first four positive integers."</p>
<p>The second way of describing a set is through extension: listing each member of the set. An extensional definition is denoted by enclosing the list of members in curly brackets: <span class='clFormula'>$C = \left \{ 4, 2, 1, 3 \right \}$</span>
.</p>
<p>Every element of a set must be unique; no two members may be identical. All set operations preserve this property. The order in which the elements of a set are listed is irrelevant (unlike for a sequence). Therefore:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 6, 11 \right \} = \left \{ 11, 6 \right  \} =  \left \{ 11, 6, 6, 11 \right \}$</div>

<p>because the extensional specification means merely that each of the elements listed is a member of the set.</p>
<p>For sets with many elements, the enumeration of members can be abbreviated. For instance, the set of the first thousand positive integers may be specified extensionally as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 1,2,3, \cdots , 1000 \right \}$</div>

<p>where the ellipsis (<span class='clFormula'>$\cdots$</span>
) indicates that the list continues in the obvious way. Ellipses may also be used where sets have infinitely many members. Thus the set of positive even numbers can be written as <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 2,4,6,8, \cdots \right \}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Subsets and Supersets</h3>

<p>A <em>subset</em> is a set whose every element is also contained in another set. For example, if every member of set <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is also a member of set <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is said to be a subset of <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
. This is written <span class='clFormula'>$A \subseteq B$</span>
(also pronounced "<span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is contained in <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
"). Equivalently, we can say that  <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
is a <em>superset </em>of <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
, which means that <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
includes <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
contains <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
. This is written
<span class='clFormula'>$B \supseteq  A$</span>
.</p>
<p>For example, <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 1,3 \right \} \subseteq \left \{ 1,2,3,4 \right \}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Common  Sets</h3>

<p>Some of the most commonly referenced sets of numbers are as follows.</p>
<p>The set of <em>natural numbers</em>, also known as "counting numbers," includes all whole numbers starting at 1 and then increasing. The set of natural numbers is represented by the symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{N}$</span>
and can be denoted as <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{N}=\left \{ 1,2,3,4, \cdots \right \}$</span>
.</p>
<p>The set of <em>real numbers</em> includes every number, negative and decimal included, that exists on the number line. The set of real numbers is represented by the symbol  <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{R}$</span>
.</p>
<p>The set of <em>integers</em> includes all whole numbers (positive and negative), including <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. The set of integers is represented by the symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{Z}$</span>
. (This may seem odd, but it stands for the German term "Zahlen," which means "numbers.") </p>
<p>The set of <em>rational numbers</em>, denoted by the symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{Q}$</span>
, includes any number that is written as a fraction. The symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{Q}$</span>
 is used because Q represents the word "quotient".</p>
<p>The set of <em>imaginary numbers</em>, denoted by the symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{I}$</span>
, includes all numbers that result in a negative number when squared.</p>
<p>The set of <em>complex numbers,</em> denoted by the symbol <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbb{C}$</span>
, includes a combination of real and imaginary numbers in the form of <span class='clFormula'>$a+bi$</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 are real numbers and <span class='clFormula'>$i$</span>

<h3 id='concept_363'>1.2.4. Factors</h3>

<blockquote>Any whole number greater than one can be factored, which means it can be broken down into smaller integers.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate numbers' factors and prime factors</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Factorization (or factoring) is the process of breaking an object (such as a number or algebraic expression) down into a product of other objects, or factors, which when multiplied together give the original number or expression. </li>
<li>Prime factorization is a particular type of factorization that breaks a number of interest into prime numbers that when multiplied back together produce the original number.</li>
<li>Every positive integer greater than 1 has a distinct prime factorization.</li>

<dd>A whole number greater than 1 that can  be divided evenly by only the number 1 and itself.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In mathematics, factorization (or factoring) is the process of breaking an object (such as a number or algebraic expression) down into a product of other objects, or <em>factors</em>, which when multiplied together give the original number or expression. The aim of factoring is to reduce something to "basic building blocks." This process has many real-life applications and can help us solve  problems in mathematics. </p>
<p>In particular, factoring a number means to break it down into numbers that when multiplied back together produce the given number. For now, we will focus on factoring whole numbers. </p>
<p>For example, consider the number 24. To find the factors, consider the numbers that yield a product of 24. We know that <span class='clFormula'>$6 \times 4 = 24$</span>
, so both 6 and 4 are factors of 24. If we think about it, we can list all of the numbers that 24 is divisible by: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. This is a complete list of the factors of 24.</p>

<h3>Prime Factorization</h3>

<p>Prime factorization is a particular type of factorization that breaks a number of interest into <em>prime</em> numbers that when multiplied back together produce the original number. Such prime numbers are called prime factors. </p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>For example, consider the number 6. We know that <span class='clFormula'>$2 \times 3 = 6$</span>
, so 2 and 3 are both factors of 6. Also note that 2 and 3 are prime numbers, because each is  divisible by only 1 and itself. Therefore, 2 and 3 are prime factors of 6.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Now, consider the number 12. We know that <span class='clFormula'>$2 \times 6 = 12$</span>
, so 2 and 6 are both factors of 12. However, 6 is not a prime factor. In this case, we must reduce 6 to its prime factors as well. Since we know from the previous example that the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (because <span class='clFormula'>$2 \times 3 = 6$</span>
), we can easily recognize that <span class='clFormula'>$2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12$</span>
. We have now found factors for 12 that are all prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factorization for 12 is <span class='clFormula'>$2 \times 2 \times 3$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Factor Trees and Prime Factorization</h3>

<p>Every positive integer greater than 1 has a distinct prime factorization. To factor larger numbers, it can be helpful to draw a factor tree.</p>
<p>In a factor tree, the number of interest is written at the top. Then, two factors of that number are found and connected below that number with branches. This process repeats for each subsequent factor of the original number until all the factors at the bottoms of the branches are prime. </p>

<h3 id='concept_92'>1.3.1. Percents</h3>

<blockquote>Percentages are used to express how large or small one quantity is relative to another quantity.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use percents to solve real-world problems</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>
In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.
</li>
<li>A percentage usually represents a part of, or a change in, a quantity.</li>
<li>Due to inconsistent usage, it is not always clear from the context what a percentage is relative to. When speaking of a "10% rise" or a "10% fall" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dt>percent</dt>
<dd>A number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percent sign or the abbreviation "pct." For example, 45% (read as "forty-five percent") is equal to 45/100, or 0.45.</p>
<p>Percentages are used to express how large or small one quantity is relative to another quantity. For example, an increase of \$0.15 on a price of \$2.50 is an increase by a fraction of 0.15/2.50 = 0.06. 0.06 is read as "6 hundredths"; therefore, you know it is 6 parts out of a hundred parts. Expressed as a percentage, this is  a 6% increase.</p>

<h3>Calculating Percentage</h3>



<p>To calculate a percentage, you turn the numbers into a ratio as a fraction of 100. For example, if someone says that 8 out of  15 students are boys, you can calculate the percentage of students who are boys as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \displaystyle \frac{8}{15} &amp;= .53&#10;\\ &amp;=\frac{53}{100}&#10;\\ &amp;=53\%&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore, 53% of the students are boys.</p>


<p>To calculate a percentage of another percentage, you convert both percentages to decimals and multiply them, at which point you can translate the decimal result back to a fraction and then a percentage. For example, 50% of 40% is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \displaystyle &#10;\frac{50}{100}\cdot\frac{40}{100} &amp;= 0.50 \cdot 0.40&#10;\\ &amp;= 0.20&#10;\\ &amp;= \frac{20}{100}&#10;\\ &amp;= 20\%&#10;\end{align}$</div>






<h3>Mixture Problems</h3>

<p>Mixture problems may involve combining two or more substances or objects and require you to find the percent of one of those substances out of the entire mixture. The percent value is computed by multiplying the numeric value of the ratio by 100.</p>
<p>For example, to find the percentage of 50 green apples out of 1,250 red and green apples in a barrel, first compute the ratio:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{50}{1250} = .04$</span></p>
<p>and then multiply by 100:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$.04 \times 100 = 4\%$</span></p>
<p>Therefore, 4% of the apples in the barrel are green.</p>



<h3>The Importance of Specificity</h3>

<p>Whenever we talk about a percentage, it is important to specify what the percentage is relative to.  When speaking of a "10% rise" or a "10% fall" in a quantity, for example, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity. For example, if an item is initially priced at \$200 and the price rises 10% (an increase of \$20), the new price will be \$220. Note that this final price is actually 110% of the initial price (100% + 10% = 110%)—hence the potential confusion.</p>
<p>The following problem illustrates this point more fully.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In a certain college, 60% of all students are female, and 10% of all students are computer science majors. If 5% of female students are computer science majors, what percentage of computer science majors are female? Here, we have been asked to compute the ratio of female computer science majors to all computer science majors. We know that 60% of all students are female, and among these 5% are computer science majors, so we conclude that:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{60}{100} \times \dfrac{5}{100} = \dfrac{3}{100} = 3 \%$</span></p>
<p> Therefore, 3% of all students are female computer science majors. We now need to divide by the proportion of all students that are computer science majors, which we have been told is 10%:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{3\%}{10\%}=\dfrac{30}{100}=30\%$</div>

<p>Therefore, 30% of all computer science majors at this school are female.</p>

<h3>Percentages Greater than 100</h3>


<h3>
</h3>

<p>Although percentages are usually used to express numbers between zero and one, any ratio can be expressed as a percentage. For instance, 1.11 can also be written as 111%, and -0.0035 can also be written as -0.35%. </p>
<p>A percentage greater than 100 can represent  growth, as in product sales increasing by 110%. Conversely, a negative percent value can represent a decrease in a value, as in a -5% change in sales, which would indicate a 5% drop.</p>

<h3 id='concept_364'>1.3.2. Averages</h3>

<blockquote>The arithmetic mean, or average, of a set of numbers indicates the "middle" or "typical" value of a data set.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the average of a set of numbers in a real-world context</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An average is a measure of the "middle" or "typical" value of a data set.</li>
<li>An arithmetic mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in that collection and is often called the "average."</li>
<li>There are many real-world applications for calculating averages.</li>

<dt>arithmetic mean</dt>
<dd>The measure of central

</dl>

<p>The arithmetic mean, or "average" is a measure of the "middle" or "typical" value of a data set. It is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in that collection. While it is often referred to simply as "mean" or "average," the term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.</p>
<p>The arithmetic mean is used frequently not only in mathematics and statistics but also in fields such as economics, sociology, and history. For example, per capita
income is the arithmetic mean income of a nation's population.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a data set containing the values <span class='clFormula'>$a_1, \dots, a_n$</span>
. The arithmetic mean <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is defined via the expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle A = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \frac{1}{n}(a_1 + \cdots + a_n)$</div>

<p>This is simply a mathematical way of writing "the mean equals the sum of all of the values in the set, divided by the number of values in the set."</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>To see how this applies to an actual set of numbers, consider the following set: <span class='clFormula'>$\{3,5,10\}$</span>
.</p>
<p>In order to find the average, we must first find the sum of the numbers:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3 + 5 + 10 = 15$</div>

<p>Next, divide their sum by 3, the number of values in the set:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{15}{3} = 5$</div>

<p>Therefore, the average of the set of numbers <span class='clFormula'>$\{3,5,10\}$</span>
is 5.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Find the average of the following set of numbers: <span class='clFormula'>$\{12, 25, 34, 17, 8, 42\}$</span></p>
<p>We need to add the values together and then divide that sum by the total number of values, which is 6.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{12 + 25 + 34 + 17 + 8 + 42}{6} = \dfrac{136}{6} = 23$</div>

<p>The average of this set is 23. </p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<p>Consider the following real-life situation. A small company has 8 employees. Two of those employees are paid \$35 per hour, two of them are paid \$27 per hour, and four are paid \$25 per hour. What is the average hourly wage of these 8 employees?</p>
<p>We need to add together each of the hourly salaries and then divide by 8, the number of employees: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{35 + 35 + 27 + 27 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25}{8}= \dfrac{224}{8} = 28$</div>

<p>Therefore, employees of this company are paid an average hourly wage of \$28.</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Roots are the inverse operation of exponentiation. This means that if <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt [ n ]{ x } = r$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>${r}^{n}=x$</span>

<li>The square root of a value is the number that when squared results in the initial value. In other words, <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{y}=x$</span>

</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dd>A root of degree 2, written in the form <equation>$\sqrt{a}$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Roots
are the inverse operation of exponentiation. Mathematical expressions with roots are called radical expressions and can be easily recognized because they contain a radical symbol (<span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{}$</span>
).</p>
<p>Recall that exponents signify that we should multiply a given integer a certain number of times. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$7^2$</span>
tells us that we should multiply 7 by itself two times:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$7^2 = 7 \cdot 7 = 49$</div>

<p>Since roots are the inverse operation of exponentiation, they allow us to work backwards from the solution of an exponential expression to the number in the base of the expression. </p>
<p>For example, the following is a radical expression that reverses the above solution, working backwards from 49 to its square root: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{49} = 7$</div>

<p>In this expression, the symbol  is known as the "radical," and the solution of 7 is called the "root." </p>
<p>Finding the value for a particular root can be much more difficult than solving an exponential expression. For now, it is  important simplify to recognize the relationship between roots and exponents: if a root <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is defined as the <span class='clFormula'>$n \text{th}$</span>
root of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, it is represented as </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt [ n ]{ x } = r$</div>

<p> Because roots are the inverse  of exponents, we can cancel out the root in this equation by raising the answer to the nth power: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left( \sqrt [ n ]{ x }\right) ^n = \left(r\right) ^n$</div>

<p>To simplify:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>${r}^{n}=x$</div>


<h3>Square Roots</h3>

<p>If
the square root of a number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is calculated, the result is a number that when
squared (i.e., when raised to an exponent of 2) gives the original number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. This can be written symbolically as follows: <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt x = y$</span>
if <span class='clFormula'>${y}^{2}=x$</span>
. This rule applies to the series of real numbers <span class='clFormula'>${ y }^{ 2 }\ge 0$</span>
, regardless of the value of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. As such, when <span class='clFormula'>$x&lt;0$</span>
then <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt x$</span>
cannot be defined.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following: <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{36}$</span>
. This is read as "the square root of 36" or "radical 36." You may recognize that <span class='clFormula'>$6^2 = 6 \cdot 6 = 36$</span>
, and therefore conclude that 6 is the root of <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{36}$</span>
. Thus we have the answer, <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{36} = 6$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Cube Roots</h3>

<p>The cube root of a number (<span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt [ 3 ]{x}$</span>
) can also be calculated. The cube root of a value <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is the number that when cubed (i.e., when raised to an exponent of 3) yields the original number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example, the cube root of 8 is 2 because <span class='clFormula'>$2^3 = 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2=8$</span>
. This can also be written as <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[3]{8}=2$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Other Roots</h3>

<p>There are an infinite number of possible roots all in the form of <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt [n]{a}$</span>
. Any non-zero integer can be substituted for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[4]{a}$</span>
is called the "fourth root of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
," and <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[20]{a}$</span>
is called the "twentieth root of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
." </p>
<p>Note that for any such root, if <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt [n]{a} = b$</span>
then <span class='clFormula'>${b}^{n} = a$</span>
. As an example, consider <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[4]{2401} = 7$</span>
. <span class='clFormula'>$7^4 = 7\cdot 7\cdot 7\cdot 7 = 2401$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_82'>1.4.2. Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying Radical Expressions</h3>

<blockquote>Radicals and exponents have particular requirements for addition and subtraction while multiplication is carried out more freely.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Differentiate between correct and incorrect uses of operations on radical expressions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>To add radicals, the radicand (the number that is under the radical) must be the same for each radical.</li>
<li>Subtraction follows the same rules as addition: the radicand must be the same.</li>

<dd>An expression that represents the root of a number or quantity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Roots are the inverse operation for exponents. An expression with roots is called a radical expression. It's easy, although perhaps tedious, to compute exponents given a root. For instance <span class='clFormula'>$7\cdot7\cdot7\cdot7 = 49\cdot49 = 2401$</span>
. So, we know the fourth root of 2401 is 7, and the square root of 2401 is 49. What is the third root of 2401? Finding the value for a particular root is difficult. This is because exponentiation is a different kind of function than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
<p>Let's go through some basic mathematical operations with radicals and exponents.</p>

<h3>Adding and Subtracting Radical Expressions</h3>

<p>To add radicals, the <em>radicand</em> (the number that is under the radical) must be the same for each radical, so, a generic equation will have the form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a\sqrt{b}+c\sqrt{b} = (a+c)\sqrt{b}$</div>

<p>Let's plug some numbers in place of the variables:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt 3 +2\sqrt 3 = 3\sqrt 3$</div>

<p>Subtraction follows the same rules as addition:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a\sqrt b - c\sqrt b = (a-c)\sqrt b$</div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3\sqrt 3 -2\sqrt 3 = \sqrt 3$</div>


<h3>Multiplying Radical Expressions</h3>

<p>Multiplication of radicals simply requires that we multiply the variable under the radical signs.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt a \cdot \sqrt b = \sqrt {a\cdot b}$</div>

<p>Some examples with real numbers:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt 3 \cdot \sqrt 6 = \sqrt {18}$</div>

<p>This equation can actually be simplified further; we will go over simplification in another section.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Radical Expressions</h3>

<p>A radical expression can be simplified if:</p>

<ol>
<li>the value under the radical sign can be written as an exponent,</li>
<li>there are fractions under the radical sign,</li>
<li>there is a radical expression in the denominator.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the radical expression <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{16}{3}}$</span>
 can be simplified by first removing the squared value from the numerator.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{16}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{4^2}{3}} = 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$</div>

<p>Then, the fraction under the radical sign can be addressed, and the radical in the numerator can again be simplified.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}$</div>

<p>Finally, the radical needs to be removed from the denominator.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{3}$</div>

</dl>

<p>In mathematics, we are often given terms in the form of fractions with radicals in the numerator and/or denominator. When we are given expressions that involve radicals in the denominator, it makes it easier to evaluate the expression if we rewrite it in a way that the radical is no longer in the denominator. This process is called <em>rationalizing the denominator</em>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, remember that  whatever we do to one side of an algebraic equation, we must also do to the other side. This same principle can be applied to fractions: whatever we do to the numerator, we must also do to the denominator, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>Let's look at an example to illustrate the process of rationalizing the denominator.</p>
<p>You are given the fraction <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}$</span>
, and you want to simplify it by eliminating the radical from the denominator. Recall that a radical multiplied by itself equals its radicand, or the value under the radical sign. Therefore,  multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$</span>
, and watch how the radical expression disappears from the denominator:<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot &#10;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} &#10;= {\frac{10\cdot\sqrt{3}}{{\sqrt{3}}^2}} = {\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}}$</span></p>

<p>There are several useful rules for operating on numbers with exponents. The following four rules, also known as "identities,"  hold for all integer exponents, provided that the base is non-zero.</p>

<h3>Multiplying Exponential Expressions with the Same Base
 </h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$</div>

<p><span class='clFormula'>$a^m$</span>
means that you have  <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
. If you multiply this quantity by <span class='clFormula'>$a^n$</span>
, i.e. by <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
additional factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, then you have <span class='clFormula'>$a^{m+n}$</span>
factors in total. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$5^3 \cdot 5^4=5^{3+4}=5^7$</div>

<p>Note that you can only add exponents in this way if the corresponding terms have the same base.</p>

<h3>Dividing Exponential Expressions with the Same Base</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{{a}^{m}}{{a}^{n}}={a}^{m-n}$</div>

<p>In the same way that <span class='clFormula'>${ a }^{ m }\cdot { a }^{ n }={ a }^{ m+n }$</span>
because you are adding on factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, dividing removes factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
. If you have <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
factors of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
in the denominator, then you can cross out <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
factors from the numerator. If there were <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
factors in the numerator, now you have <span class='clFormula'>$(m-n)$</span>
factors in the numerator.</p>
<p>In order to visualize this process, consider the fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{3^5}{3^2}$</div>

<p>This fraction can be rewritten as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3}{3 \cdot 3}$</div>

<p>Here you can see that two 3s will cancel out from the numerator and denominator. We are left with:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3}{1} = 3^3$</div>

<p>As an additional example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{7^4}{7^2}=7^{4-2}=7^2$</div>


<h3>Raising an Exponential Expression to an Exponent</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>${({a}^{n})}^{m}={a}^{n \cdot m}$</div>

<p>If you think about an exponent as telling you that you have a certain number of factors of the base, then <span class='clFormula'>${({a}^{n})}^{m}$</span>
means that you have factors <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
of <span class='clFormula'>$a^n$</span>
. Therefore, you have <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
groups of <span class='clFormula'>$a^n$</span>
, and each one of those has <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
groups of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
. Therefore, you have <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
groups of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
groups of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
; therefore, you have <span class='clFormula'>$n \cdot m$</span>
groups of <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>${a}^{n \cdot m}$</span>
. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(3^3)^3=3^{3 \cdot 3}=3^9$</div>


<h3>Raising a Product to an Exponent</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>${(ab)}^{n}={a}^{n}{b}^{n}$</div>

<p>You can multiply numbers in any order you please. Instead of multiplying together <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
factors equal to <span class='clFormula'>$ab$</span>
, you could multiply all of the <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
s together and all of the <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
s together and then finish by multiplying <span class='clFormula'>$a^n$</span>
by <span class='clFormula'>$b^n$</span>
. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(4\cdot5)^3=4^3\cdot5^3$</div>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression: <span class='clFormula'>$(3\cdot2)^3\cdot (2^5)^4$</span></p>
<p>For the first part of the expression, apply the rule for a product raised to an exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(3\cdot2)^3\cdot (2^5)^4 = 3^3 \cdot 2^3 \cdot (2^5)^4$</div>

<p>For the last part of the expression, apply the rule for raising an exponential expression to an exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^3 \cdot 2^3 \cdot (2^5)^4 = 3^3 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 2^{5\cdot 4} = 3^3 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 2^{20}$</div>

<p>Notice that two of the terms in this expression have the same base: 2. These two terms can be combined by applying the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^3 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 2^{20} = 3^3 \cdot 2^{3+20} = 3^3 \cdot 2^{23}$</div>

<p>Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$3^3 \cdot 2^{23}$</span>
is the simplified form of this expression.</p>

<h3 id='concept_367'>1.5.2. Negative Exponents</h3>

<blockquote>Numbers with negative exponents are treated normally in arithmetic operations and can be rewritten as fractions.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Relate negative exponents to fractions and work with them accordingly</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An exponential expression with a negative integer in the exponent can be rewritten as a fraction by applying the rule <span class='clFormula'>$b^{-n} = \frac{1}{b^n}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The rules for operating on numbers with exponents still apply when the exponent is a negative integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solving mathematical problems involving negative exponents may seem daunting. However, negative exponents are treated much like positive exponents when applying the rules for operations. There is an additional rule that allows us to change the negative exponent to a positive one in the denominator of a fraction, and it  holds true for any real numbers <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$b \neq 0$</span>
:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$b^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{b^n}$</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$6^{-2} = \dfrac{1}{6^2} = \dfrac{1}{36}$</span></p>
<p>To understand how this rule is derived, consider the following fraction: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7^3}{7^5}$</div>

<p>We can rewrite this as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7 \cdot 7 \cdot 7}{7 \cdot 7 \cdot 7 \cdot 7 \cdot 7}$</div>

<p>We then notice that three 7s cancel from both the numerator and denominator, and we are left with: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{1}{7 \cdot 7} = \dfrac{1}{7^2}$</div>

<p>Note that if we apply the rule for division of numbers with exponents, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7^3}{7^5} = 7^{(3-5)}= 7^{-2}$</div>

<p>Thus, we can identify that: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{1}{7^2} = 7^{-2}$</div>

<p>This rule makes it possible to simplify expressions with negative exponents.</p>
<p>Note that each of the rules for operations on numbers with exponents still apply when the exponent is a negative number. For example, consider the rule for multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base. The following is true: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3^{-4} \cdot 3^2 = 3^{-4+2} = 3^{-2} = \dfrac{1}{3^2}$</div>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression: <span class='clFormula'>$(2^{-4})^2$</span>
.</p>
<p>Note that  the rule for raising an exponential expression to another exponent can be applied: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2^{-4})^2 = 2^{(-4)(2)} = 2^{-8} $</div>

<p>This can be simplified using the rule for negative exponents:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$2^{-8}=\dfrac{1}{2^8}$</span></p>

<h3>Example </h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression: <span class='clFormula'>$(3^{-2} \cdot 3^4)^{-3}$</span>
.</p>
<p>Recall that the rule for multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base can be applied. Therefore, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$3^{-2} \cdot 3^4 = 3^{-2+4} = 3^2$</span>
 </p>
<p>Now place this value back into the parentheses, and apply the rule for raising an exponential expression to an exponent:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$(3^2)^{-3} = 3^{(2)(-3)} = 3^{-6} = \dfrac{1}{3^6}$</span>
 </p>

<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>

</dl>

<p>A rational exponent is a rational number that provides another method for writing roots. For example, an <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th root of a number <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
such that <span class='clFormula'>$x^n = b$</span>
. If <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a positive real number and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is a positive integer, then there is exactly one positive real solution to <span class='clFormula'>$ x^n = b$</span>
. This solution is called the  <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th root of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 and is denoted <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[n]{b}$</span>
 or  <span class='clFormula'>$b^\frac{1}{n}$</span>
. For example: <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{4}=4^\frac{1}{2}=2$</span>
.</p>
<p>There are also cases where the exponent is a fraction <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{m}{n}$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is an integer and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is a positive integer. In such cases, the exponent acts as both a whole number exponent and a root, or fraction exponent. In other words, the following holds true:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{{b}^{\frac {m}{n}}= {({b}^{m})}^{\frac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{{b}^{m}}}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is a real number and the rational exponent <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{m}{n}$</span>
is a fraction in lowest terms.</p>
<p>The following rules hold true about the signs of roots and rational exponents. For a rational exponent <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{m}{n}$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{m}{n}$</span>
 is in lowest terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root is positive if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is even; for example, <span class='clFormula'>$(-27)^\frac{2}{3}=9$</span>
. </li>
<li>The root is negative for negative <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
are odd; for example, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle (-27)^\frac{1}{3}=-3$</span>
.  </li>
<li>The root can be either sign if <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is positive and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is even; for example,  <span class='clFormula'>$64^\frac{1}{2}$</span>
has two roots: <span class='clFormula'>$8$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-8$</span>
. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that since there is no real number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
such that <span class='clFormula'>$x^2 = -1$</span>
, the definition of <span class='clFormula'>$b^{\frac{m}{n}}$</span>
when <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is negative and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is even must involve the imaginary number <span class='clFormula'>$i$</span>
.</p>
<p>The following are rules for operations on numbers with rational exponents. </p>

<h3>Multiplying Numbers with Rational Exponents</h3>

<p>The following holds true for any rational exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$</div>

<p>For example, we can rewrite <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[3]{16}$</span>
as a product: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[3]{16}= \sqrt[3]{8} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}$</div>

<p>Notice that <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$</span>
, and therefore we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[3]{16} = 2\sqrt[3]{2}$</div>


<h3>Dividing Numbers with Rational Exponents</h3>

<p>The following holds true for any rational exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[n]{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$</div>

<p>For example, we can rewrite <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{\frac{13}{9}}$</span>
as a fraction with two radicals: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{\dfrac{13}{9}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{9}}$</div>

<p>Notice that the denominator can be simplified further:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{9} = 3$</div>

<p>Therefore, the simplified form is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{\dfrac{13}{9}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{3}$</div>


<h3>Canceling Powers and Roots</h3>

<p>In some cases, writing an exponent in its fraction form makes it easier to cancel powers and roots. Recall that <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[n]{{b}^{m}}= {({b}^{m})}^{\frac{1}{n}}= {b}^{\frac {m}{n}} $</span>
. We can use this rule to easily  simplify a number that has both an exponent and a root. </p>
<p>For example, consider <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[4]{5^8}$</span>
. This would take a long time to work out by hand, but consider how it can be rewritten using a rational exponent: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt[4]{5^8} = 5^{\frac{8}{4}}$</div>

<p>We can simplify the fraction in the exponent to 2, giving us <span class='clFormula'>$5^2=25$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{ \dfrac{3^8}{25}}$</div>

<p>This expression can be rewritten using the rule for dividing numbers with rational exponents:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{ \dfrac{3^8}{25}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{3^8}}{\sqrt{25}}$</div>

<p>Notice that the radical in the denominator is a perfect square and can therefore be rewritten as follows: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{25} = 5$</span>
.</p>
<p>Now, notice that the numerator can be rewritten:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{3^8} = (3^8)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{\frac{8}{2}}= 3^4$</span>
.</p>
<p>Therefore, the simplified form is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{ \dfrac{3^8}{5}} = \dfrac{3^4}{5}$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{\sqrt{7^5}}{\sqrt[4]{7^2}}$</div>

<p>First, rewrite the numerator and denominator in rational exponent form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7^{\frac{5}{2}}}{7^{\frac{2}{4}}}$</div>

<p>Notice that the exponent in the denominator can be simplified:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7^{\frac{5}{2}}}{7^{\frac{1}{2}}}$</div>

<p>Recall the rule for dividing numbers with exponents, in which the exponents are subtracted. Applying the division rule, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{7^{\frac{5}{2}}}{7^{\frac{1}{2}}} = 7^{\left(\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right)} = 7^{\frac{4}{2}} = 7^2$</div>

<p>Thus, the simplified form is simply <span class='clFormula'>$7^2 = 49$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_66'>1.5.4. Scientific Notation</h3>

<blockquote>Scientific notation is used to express a very large or small number in the form <span class='clFormula'>$m \cdot 10^n$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
has only one digit left of the decimal point.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain why scientific notation is useful in performing calculations with large or small numbers</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form.</li>
<li>In normalized scientific notation, the exponent <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is chosen so that the absolute value of <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
remains at least 1 but less than 10 <span class='clFormula'>$\left ( 1 \leq \left | m \right | &lt; 10 \right )$</span>
—i.e. so that <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
has exactly one digit left of its decimal point.</li>
<li>When numbers written in scientific notation are involved in multiplication or division, the
standard rules for operations with exponentiation apply. When addition or subtraction is involved, the numbers must first be rewritten so the exponents are the same.</li>
<li>Most calculators present very large and very small results in scientific notation. Because superscripted exponents like <span class='clFormula'>$10^7$</span>
cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter E or e is often used to represent "times ten raised to the power of" (which would be written as "<span class='clFormula'>$\cdot 10^b$</span>
").</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>scientific notation</dt>
<dd>A method of writing or of displaying real numbers as a decimal number between 1 and 10 multiplied by an integer power of 10.</dd>
<dt>normalized scientific notation</dt>
<dd>A number written in scientific notation <equation>$m \cdot 10^n$</equation> such that the
absolute value of <equation>$m$</equation> remains at least 1 but less than 10.</dd>
</dl>

<p><em>Scientific notation</em>, also known as "standard form," is a way to more conveniently write numbers that are very large or very small. This method is commonly used by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>
For example, the numbers   <span class='clFormula'>$43,000,000,000,000,000,000$</span>
(the number of different possible configurations of a Rubik's cube) and   <span class='clFormula'>$0.000000000000000000000340$</span>
 (the mass of the amino acid tryptophan) are extremely inconvenient to write and read. Therefore, they can be rewritten as a power of 10 using scientific notation.
</p>
<p>Scientific notation is written as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$m \cdot 10^n$</div>

<p>This is read "<span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 times 10 raised to the power of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
."</p>



<h3>How to Use Scientific Notation</h3>

<p>To write a number in scientific notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the decimal point so that there is one nonzero digit to its left.</li>
<li>Multiply the result by a power of 10 using an exponent whose absolute value is the number of places the decimal point was moved. Make the exponent positive if the decimal point was moved to the left and negative if the decimal point was moved to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's write the number 43,500 in scientific notation. There are four digits in this number, so the decimal should be moved 4 places to the left to leave one nonzero digit left of the decimal point:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$43,500 = 4.35 \cdot 10^{4}$</div>

<p>The exponent is -4 because the decimal point was moved to the left (the exponent would be positive had the decimal been moved to the right) by exactly 4 places.A number written in scientific notation can also be converted to standard form by reversing the process described above. For example, let's write the number <span class='clFormula'>$2.15 \cdot 10^{-3}$</span>
 in standard form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2.15 \cdot 10^{-3}= 0.00215$</div>

<p>To reverse the process, we move the decimal point three places to the left, adding leading zeroes where necessary.</p>

<h3>Normalized Scientific Notation</h3>

<p>Any given number can be written in the form of <span class='clFormula'>$m \cdot 10^{n}$</span>
 in many ways; for example, 350 can be written as <span class='clFormula'>$3.5 \cdot 10^{2}$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$35 \cdot 10^{1}$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$350 \cdot 10^{0}$</span>
, etc.</p>
<p>In <em>normalized scientific notation</em>, also called exponential notation, the exponent <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is chosen so that the absolute value of <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
remains at least 1 but less than 10. In other words,  <span class='clFormula'>$  1 \leq  | m | &lt; 10 $</span>
.
This form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign with <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 as a base, as the exponent <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
gives the number's order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Following these rules, 350 would always be written as <span class='clFormula'>$3.5 \cdot 10^{2}$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$0.015$</span>
 would always be written as <span class='clFormula'>$1.5 \cdot 10^{-2}$</span>
.  Note that <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
cannot be written in normalized scientific notation since it cannot be expressed as <span class='clFormula'>$m \cdot 10^n$</span>
 or any non-zero <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
. </p>
<p>Normalized scientific form is the typical form of expression for large numbers in many fields, except during intermediate calculations or when an unnormalized form, such as engineering notation, is desired.</p>

<h3>Calculations involving Scientific Notation</h3>

<p>When numbers written in scientific notation are multiplied or divided, the standard rules for operations with exponentiation apply. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle (3.12 \cdot 10^2) \cdot (4.06 \cdot 10^5) &amp;= 3.12 \cdot 4.06 \cdot 10^{\left(2+5\right)}&#10;\\&amp;=12.67 \cdot 10^7&#10;\\&amp;=1.267 \cdot 10^8&#10;\end{align}&#10;&#10;$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle \frac{1.85 \cdot 10^3}{4.25 \cdot 10^{-2}} &amp;=&#10;\frac{1.85}{4.25} \cdot 10^{3-(-2)}&#10;\\&amp;=.435 \cdot 10^5&#10;\\&amp;= 4.35 \cdot 10^4&#10;\end{align}$</div>



<p>When numbers written in scientific notation are added to or subtracted from each other, the terms first must be rewritten so the exponents are  the same. Then, the constant value, or <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, can simply be added or subtracted. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;\displaystyle &#10;(3.12 \cdot 10^6)+(1.24 \cdot 10^7)&amp;= &#10;(3.12 \cdot 10^6)+(12.4 \cdot 10^6)&#10;\\&amp;= 15.52 \cdot 10^6&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<h3>E Notation</h3>

<p>Most calculators and many computer programs present very large and very small results in scientific notation. Because superscripted exponents like <span class='clFormula'>$10^7$</span>
cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter E or e is often used to represent the phrase "times ten raised to the power of" (which would be written as "<span class='clFormula'>$\cdot 10^n$</span>
") and is followed by the value of the exponent. Note that in this usage, the character e is not related to the mathematical constant <span class='clFormula'>$\mathbf{e}$</span>
 or the exponential function <span class='clFormula'>$e^x$</span>
(a confusion that is less likely if a capital E is used), and though it stands for exponent, the notation is usually referred to as (scientific) E notation or (scientific) e notation, rather than (scientific) exponential notation. The use of this notation is not encouraged by publications, however.</p>
