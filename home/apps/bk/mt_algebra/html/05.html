<h3>What is a Linear Function?</h3>

<p>A linear function is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. For example, a common equation, <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
, (namely the slope-intercept form, which we will learn more about later) is a linear function because it meets both criteria with <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 as variables and <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
as constants.  It is linear: the exponent of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 term is a one (first power), and it follows the definition of a function: for each input (<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
) there is exactly one output (<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
).  Also, its graph is a straight line.  </p>

<h3>Graphs of Linear Functions</h3>

<p>The origin of the name "linear" comes from the fact that the set of solutions of such an equation forms a straight line in the plane. In the linear function graphs below, the constant, <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, determines the slope or gradient of that line, and the constant term, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, determines the point at which the line crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, otherwise known as the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept. </p>



<a href='../images/0501.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0501.png' alt='Graphs of linear functions'></a>

<div><b><i>Graphs of linear functions</i></b></div>
<p>The blue line, <span class='clFormula'>$y=\frac{1}{2}x-3$</span>
 and the red line, <span class='clFormula'>$y=-x+5$</span>
 are both linear functions.  The blue line has a positive slope of <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{2}$</span>
 and a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept of <span class='clFormula'>$-3$</span>
; the red line has a negative slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
 and a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept of <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
.</p>


<h3>Vertical and Horizontal Lines</h3>

<p>Vertical lines have an undefined slope, and cannot be represented in the form <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
, but instead as an equation of the form <span class='clFormula'>$x=c$</span>
 for a constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, because the vertical line intersects a value on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
.  For example, the graph of the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x=4$</span>
 includes the same input value of <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 for all points on the line, but would have different output values, such as <span class='clFormula'>$(4,-2),(4,0),(4,1),(4,5),$</span>
 etcetera. Vertical lines are NOT functions, however, since each input is related to more than one output.</p>
<p>Horizontal lines have a slope of zero and is represented by the form, <span class='clFormula'>$y=b$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept.  A graph of the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=6$</span>
 includes the same output value of 6 for all input values on the line, such as <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,6),(0,6),(2,6),(6,6)$</span>
, etcetera.  Horizontal lines ARE functions because the relation (set of points) has the characteristic that each input is related to exactly one output.</p>

<h3 id='concept_381'>5.1.2. Slope</h3>

<blockquote>Slope describes the direction and steepness of a line, and can be calculated given two points on the line.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the slope of a line using "rise over run" and identify the role of slope in a linear equation</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The slope  of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line; its sign indicates the direction, while its magnitude indicates the steepness.</li>
<li>The ratio of the rise to the run is the slope of a line, <span class='clFormula'>$m = \frac{rise}{run}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The slope of a line can be calculated with the formula <span class='clFormula'>$m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_2, y_2)$</span>
are points on the line.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<h3>Slope</h3>

<p>In mathematics, the slope  of a line is a number that describes both the <em>direction</em> and the <em>steepness</em> of the line. Slope is often denoted by the letter <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
. Recall the slop-intercept form of a line, <span class='clFormula'>$y = mx + b$</span>
. Putting the equation of a line into this form gives you the slope (<span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
) of a line, and its <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept (<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
). We will now discuss the interpretation of <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, and how to calculate <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
for a given line.</p>


<p>
The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical.
A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right which implies that the slope is positive (<span class='clFormula'>$m &gt; 0$</span>
).
A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right and the slope is negative (<span class='clFormula'>$m &lt; 0$</span>
)
.
If a line is horizontal the slope is zero and is a constant function (<span class='clFormula'>$y=c$</span>
).
If a line is vertical the slope is undefined.</p>



<a href='../images/0502.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0502.png' alt='Slopes of Lines'></a>

<div><b><i>Slopes of Lines</i></b></div>
<p>The slope of a line can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined.</p>

<p>
The steepness, or incline,  of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. In other words, a line with a slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-9$</span>
is steeper than a line with a slope of <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Calculating Slope</h3>

<p>
Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the
"horizontal change" between any two distinct points on a line.
This ratio is represented by a quotient ("rise over run"), and gives
the same number for any two distinct points on the same line. It is represented by <span class='clFormula'>$m = \frac{rise}{run}$</span>
.<span class='clFormula'>$$</span></p>



<a href='../images/0503.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0503.png' alt='Visualization of Slope'></a>

<div><b><i>Visualization of Slope</i></b></div>
<p>The slope of a line is calculated as "rise over run."</p>

<p>Mathematically, the slope <em>m</em> of the line is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle &#10;m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Two points on the line are required to find <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
. Given two points <span class='clFormula'>$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_2, y_2)$</span>
, take a look at the graph below and note how the "rise" of slope is given by the difference in the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values of the two points, and the "run" is given by the difference in the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values.</p>



<a href='../images/0504.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0504.png' alt='Slope Represented Graphically'></a>

<div><b><i>Slope Represented Graphically</i></b></div>
<p>The slope <span class='clFormula'>$m =\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$</span>
 is calculated from the two points <span class='clFormula'>$\left( x_1,y_1 \right)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$\left( x_2,y_2 \right)$</span>
.</p>

<p>Now we’ll look at some graphs on a coordinate grid to find their slopes. In many cases, we can find slope by simply counting out the rise and the run. We start by locating two points on the line. If possible, we try to choose points with coordinates that are integers to make our calculations easier. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Find the slope of the line shown on the coordinate plane below.</p>



<a href='../images/0505.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0505.png' alt='Find the slope of the line'></a>

<div><b><i>Find the slope of the line</i></b></div>
<p>Notice the line is increasing so make sure to look for a slope that is positive. </p>

<p>Locate two points on the graph, choosing points whose coordinates are integers. We will use <span class='clFormula'>$(0, -3)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(5, 1)$</span>
. Starting with the point on the left, <span class='clFormula'>$(0, -3)$</span>
, sketch a right triangle, going from the first point to the second point, <span class='clFormula'>$(5, 1)$</span>
. </p>



<a href='../images/0506.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0506.png' alt='Identify points on the line'></a>

<div><b><i>Identify points on the line</i></b></div>
<p>Draw a triangle to help identify the rise and run.</p>

<p>Count the rise on the vertical leg of the triangle: <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
units. </p>
<p>Count the run on the horizontal leg of the triangle: <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
units.</p>
<p>Use the slope formula to take the ratio of rise over run: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;m &amp;= \frac{rise}{run} \\&#10;&#10;&amp;= \frac{4}{5}&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The slope of the line is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{4}{5}$</span>
. Notice that the slope is positive since the line slants upward from left to right.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Find the slope of the line shown on the coordinate plane below.</p>



<a href='../images/0507.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0507.png' alt='Find the slope of the line'></a>

<div><b><i>Find the slope of the line</i></b></div>
<p>We can see the slope is decreasing, so be sure to look for a negative slope.</p>

<p>Locate two points on the graph. Look for points with coordinates that are integers. We can choose any points, but we will use <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 5)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 3)$</span>
. </p>



<a href='../images/0508.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0508.png' alt='Identify two points on the line'></a>

<div><b><i>Identify two points on the line</i></b></div>
<p>The points <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 5)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 3)$</span>
are on the line.</p>

<p>Apply the formula for slope:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;m =\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$</span></p>
<p> Let <span class='clFormula'>$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
be the point <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 5)$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_2, y_2)$</span>
be the point <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 3)$</span>
. </p>
<p>Plugging the corresponding values into the slope formula, we get: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;m &amp;= \frac{3-5}{3-0} \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{-2}{3}&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The slope of the line is <span class='clFormula'>$- \frac{2}{3}$</span>
. Notice that the slope is negative since the line slants downward from left to right.</p>

<h3 id='concept_382'>5.1.3. Direct and Inverse Variation</h3>

<blockquote>Two variables in direct variation have a linear relationship, while variables in inverse variation do not.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Recognize examples of functions that vary directly and inversely</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Two variables that change proportionally to one another are said to be in direct variation.</li>
<li>The relationship between two directly proportionate variable can be represented by a linear equation in slope-intercept form, and is easily modeled using a linear graph.</li>
<li>Inverse variation is the opposite of direct variation; two variables are said to be inversely proportional when a change is performed on one variable and the opposite happens to the
other. </li>
<li>The relationship between two inversely proportionate variables cannot be represented by a linear equation, and its graphical representation is not a line, but a hyperbola.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>hyperbola</dt>
<dd>A conic section formed by the intersection of a cone with a plane that
intersects the base of the cone and is not tangent to the cone.</dd>
<dt>proportional</dt>
<dd>At a constant ratio. Two magnitudes (numbers) are said to be proportional if the second
varies in a direct relation arithmetically to the first.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Direct Variation</h3>

<p>Simply put, two
variables are in direct variation when the same thing that happens to
one variable happens to the other. If <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
are in direct variation,
and <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is doubled, then <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
would also be doubled. The two variables may be
considered directly proportional.</p>
<p>For example, a toothbrush costs <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
dollars. Purchasing <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
toothbrushes would cost  <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
 dollars, and purchasing <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
 toothbrushes would <span class='clFormula'>$20$</span>
 cost  dollars. Thus we can say that the cost varies directly as the value of toothbrushes.</p>
<p>Direct variation is represented by a linear equation, and can be modeled by graphing a line. Since we know that the relationship between two values is constant, we can give their relationship with:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\frac{y}{x} = k$</div>

<p>Where <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
is a constant.</p>
<p>Rewriting this equation by multiplying both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
yields:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y = kx$</div>

<p>Notice that this is a linear equation in slope-intercept form, where the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. </p>
<p>Thus, any line passing through the origin represents a direct variation between <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
:</p>



<a href='../images/0509.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0509.png' alt='Directly Proportional Variables'></a>

<div><b><i>Directly Proportional Variables</i></b></div>
<p>The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y = kx$</span>
demonstrates an example of direct variation between two variables.</p>

<p>Revisiting the
example with toothbrushes and dollars, we can define the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis as
number of toothbrushes and the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis as number of dollars. Doing so,
the variables would abide by the relationship:
</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\frac{y}{x} = 2$</div>

<p>Any augmentation of one variable would lead to an equal
augmentation of the other. For example, doubling <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
would result in the
doubling of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Inverse Variation</h3>

<p>Inverse variation is
the opposite of direct variation. In the case of inverse variation, the
increase of one variable leads to the decrease of another. In fact, two variables are said to be inversely proportional when an operation
of change is performed on one variable and the opposite happens to the
other. For example, if <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
are inversely proportional, if <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is
doubled, then <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
is halved.</p>
<p>As an example, the time taken for a journey is inversely proportional to the speed of travel. If your car travels at a greater speed, the journey to your destination will be shorter.</p>
<p>Knowing that the relationship between the
two variables is constant, we can show that their relationship is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;yx = k$</div>

<p>Where
<span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
is a constant known as the constant of proportionality. Note that as
long as <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
is not equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, neither <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
nor <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
can ever equal <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
either. We can rearrange the above equation to place the variables on opposite sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=\frac{k}{x}$</div>

<p>Notice that this is not a linear equation. It is impossible to put it in slope-intercept form. Thus, an inverse relationship cannot be represented by a line with constant slope. Inverse variation can be illustrated with a graph
in the shape of a hyperbola, pictured below. </p>



<a href='../images/0510.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0510.png' alt='Inversely Proportional Function'></a>

<div><b><i>Inversely Proportional Function</i></b></div>
<p>An inversely proportional relationship between two variables is represented graphically by a hyperbola.</p>

<h3 id='concept_122'>5.1.4. Zeroes of Linear Functions</h3>

<blockquote>A zero, or <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept, is the point at which a linear function's value will equal zero.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice finding the zeros of linear functions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A zero is a point at which a function's value will be equal to zero. Its coordinates are <span class='clFormula'>$(x,0)$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is equal to the zero of the graph.</li>
<li>Zeros can be observed graphically or solved for algebraically.</li>
<li>A linear function can have none, one, or infinitely many zeros. If the function is a horizontal line (slope = <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
), it will have no zeros unless its equation is <span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
, in which case it will have infinitely many. If the line is non-horizontal, it will have one zero.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>y-intercept</dt>
<dd>A point at which a line crosses the <equation>$y$</equation>-axis of a Cartesian grid.</dd>
<dt>zero</dt>
<dd>Also known as a root; an <equation>$x$</equation> value at which the function of <equation>$x$</equation> is equal to <equation>$0$</equation>.</dd>
<dt>linear function</dt>
<dd>An algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. </dd>
</dl>

<p>The graph of a  linear function is a straight line. Graphically, where the line crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, is called a zero, or root.  Algebraically, a zero is an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 value at which the function of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is equal to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
.  Linear functions can have none, one, or infinitely many zeros.  If there is a horizontal line through any point on the  <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, other than at zero, there are no zeros, since the line will never cross the  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis.  If the horizontal line overlaps the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, (goes through the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis at zero) then there are infinitely many zeros, since the line intersects the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis multiple times.  Finally, if the line is vertical or has a slope, then there will be only one zero.  </p>

<h3>Finding the Zeros of Linear Functions Graphically</h3>

<p>Zeros can be observed graphically.  An <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept, or zero, is a property of many functions. Because the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept (zero) is a point at which the function crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, it will have the value <span class='clFormula'>$(x,0)$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is the zero.</p>
<p>All lines, with a value for the slope, will have one zero.  To find the zero of a linear function, simply find the point where the line crosses the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. </p>

<blockquote>The slope-intercept form of a line summarizes the information necessary to quickly construct its graph.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Convert linear equations to slope-intercept form and explain why it is useful</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The slope-intercept form of a line is given by <span class='clFormula'>$y = mx + b$</span>
where <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 is the slope of the line and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept. </li>
<li>The constant <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is known as the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept.  From slope-intercept form, when <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$y=b$</span>

</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dt>slope</dt>
<dd>The ratio of the vertical and horizontal distances between two points on a line; zero if the line is horizontal, undefined if it is vertical.</dd>
<dt>y-intercept</dt>
<dd>A point at which a line crosses the <equation>$y$</equation>-axis of a Cartesian grid.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Slope-Intercept Form</h3>

<p>One of the most common representations for a line is with the slope-intercept form. Such an equation is given by <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
are variables and <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
are constants.  When written in this form, the constant <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is the value of the slope and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is  the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept.  Note that if <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=b$</span>
represents a horizontal line. Note that this equation does not allow for vertical lines, since that would require that <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
be infinite (undefined).  However, a vertical line is defined by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x=c$</span>
 for some constant <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Converting an Equation to Slope-Intercept Form</h3>

<p>Writing an equation in slope-intercept form is valuable since from the form it is easy to identify the slope and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept.  This assists in finding solutions to various problems, such as graphing, comparing two lines to determine if they are parallel or perpendicular and solving a system of equations.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's write an equation in slope-intercept form with <span class='clFormula'>$m=-\frac{2}{3}$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$b=3$</span>
.  Simply substitute the values into the slope-intercept form to obtain:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=-\frac{2}{3}x+3$</div>

<p>If an equation is not in slope-intercept form, solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
and rewrite the equation.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's write the equation <span class='clFormula'>$3x+2y=-4$</span>
 in slope-intercept form and identify the slope and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept. To solve the equation for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, first subtract <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
 from both sides of the equation to get:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;2y=-3x-4$</div>

<p> Then divide both sides of the equation by <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 to obtain: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=\frac{1}{2}(-3x-4)$</div>

<p>Which simplifies to <span class='clFormula'>$y=-\frac{3}{2}x-2$</span>
.   Now that the equation is in slope-intercept form, we see that  the slope <span class='clFormula'>$m=-\frac{3}{2}$</span>
, and the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept <span class='clFormula'>$b=-2$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Graphing an Equation in Slope-Intercept Form</h3>

<p>We begin by constructing the graph of the equation in the previous example.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We construct the graph the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=-\frac{3}{2}x-2$</span>
 using the slope-intercept method. We begin by plotting the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept <span class='clFormula'>$b=-2$</span>
, whose coordinates are <span class='clFormula'>$(0,-2)$</span>
.  The value of the slope  dictates where to place the next point.  </p>
<p>Since the value of the slope is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{-3}{2}$</span>
, the rise is <span class='clFormula'>$-3$</span>
and the run is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
.  This means that from the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,-2)$</span>
, move <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 units down, and move <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 units right.  Thus we arrive at the point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,-5)$</span>
 on the line. If the negative sign is placed with the denominator instead the slope would be written as <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{3}{-2}$</span>
, we can instead move up <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 units and left <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
 units from the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept to arrive at the point <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,1)$</span>
, also on the line.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's graph the equation <span class='clFormula'>$12x-6y-6=0$</span>
. First we solve the equation for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 by subtracting <span class='clFormula'>$12x$</span>
 to obtain: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-6y-6=-12x$</span>
  </p>
<p>Next, add <span class='clFormula'>$6$</span>
 to get:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-6y=-12x+6$</span></p>
<p> Finally, divide all terms by <span class='clFormula'>$-6$</span>
 to get the slope-intercept form:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=2x-1$</span>
 </p>
<p>The slope is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
, and the  <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept is <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
.  Using this information, graphing is easy.  Start by plotting the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>

, then use the value of the slope, <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{2}{1}$</span>

 units and right <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>

<h3 id='concept_105'>5.1.6. Point-Slope Equations</h3>

<blockquote>The point-slope equation is another way to represent a line; only the slope and a single point are needed.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use point-slope form to find the equation of a line passing through two points and verify that it is equivalent to the slope-intercept form of the equation</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The point-slope equation is given by <span class='clFormula'>$y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})$</span>
, where <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1}, y_{1})$</span>
is any point on the line, and <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is the slope of the line.</li>
<li>The point-slope equation requires that there is at least one point and the slope. If there are two points and no slope, the slope can be calculated from the two points first and then choose one of the two points to write the equation.</li>
<li>The point-slope equation and slope-intercept equations are equivalent.  It can be shown that given a point <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1}, y_{1})$</span>
and slope <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept (<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) in the slope-intercept equation is <span class='clFormula'>$y_{1}-mx_{1}$</span>
. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>point-slope equation</dt>
<dd>An equation of a line given a point <equation>$(x_{1}, y_{1})$</equation> and a slope <equation>$m$</equation>: <equation>$ y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Point-Slope Equation</h3>

<p>The point-slope equation is a way of describing the equation of a line. The point-slope form is ideal if you are given the slope and only one point, or if you are given two points and do not know what the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept is. Given a slope, <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, and a point <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1}, y_{1})$</span>
, the point-slope equation is: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})$</span>
 </p>

<h3>Verify Point-Slope Form is Equivalent to Slope-Intercept Form</h3>

<p>To show that these two equations are equivalent, choose a generic point <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1}, y_{1})$</span>
. Plug in the generic point into the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
.  The equation is now, <span class='clFormula'>$y_{1}=mx_{1}+b$</span>
, giving us the ordered pair,<span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1}, mx_{1}+b)$</span>
. Then plug this point into the point-slope equation and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 to get:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-(mx_{1}+b)=m(x-x_{1})$</div>

<p>Distribute the negative sign through and distribute <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 through <span class='clFormula'>$(x-x_{1})$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-mx_{1}-b=mx-mx_{1}$</div>

<p>Add <span class='clFormula'>$mx_{1}$</span>
 to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-mx_{1}+mx_{1}-b=mx-mx_{1}+mx_{1}$</div>

<p>Combine like terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-b=mx$</div>

<p>Add <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-b+b=mx+b$</div>

<p>Combine like terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=mx+b$</div>

<p>Therefore, the two equations are equivalent and either one can express an equation of a line depending on what information is given in the problem or what type of equation is requested in the problem.</p>

<h3>Example: Write the equation of a line in point-slope form, given a point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,1)$</span>
 and slope <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
, and convert to slope-intercept form  </h3>

<p>Write the equation of the line in point-slope form:  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-1=-4(x-2)$</div>

<p>To switch this equation into slope-intercept form, solve the equation for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-1=-4(x-2)$</span>
  </p>
<p>Distribute <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-1=-4x+8$</span>
  </p>
<p>Add <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=-4x+9$</div>



<p>The equation has the same meaning whichever form it is in, and produces the same graph.</p>

 with slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
, as well as the slope-intercept form, <span class='clFormula'>$y=-4x+9$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example: Write the equation of a line in point-slope form, given  point <span class='clFormula'>$(-3,6)$</span>
 and point <span class='clFormula'>$(1,2)$</span>
, and convert to slope-intercept form</h3>



<p>Since we have two points, but no slope, we must first find the slope: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Substituting the values of the points: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;m&amp;=\frac{-2-6}{1-(-3)}\\&amp;=\frac{-8}{4}\\&amp;=-2&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Now choose either of the two points, such as <span class='clFormula'>$(-3,6)$</span>
. Plug this point and the calculated slope into the point-slope equation to get:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-6=-2[x-(-3)]$</span></p>
<p>Be careful if one of the coordinates is a negative.  Distributing the negative sign through the parentheses, the final equation is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-6=-2(x+3)$</div>

<p>If you chose the other point, the equation would be:  <span class='clFormula'>$y+2=-2(x-1)$</span>
 and either answer is correct. </p>
<p>Next distribute <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y-6=-2x-6$</span>
   </p>
<p>Add <span class='clFormula'>$6$</span>
to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=-2x$</div>

<p> Again, the two forms of the equations are equivalent to each other and produce the same line.  The only difference is the form that they are written in.</p>

<blockquote>A linear equation  written in standard form makes it easy to calculate the zero, or <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain the process and usefulness of converting linear equations to standard form</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>The standard form of a linear equation is written as: <span class='clFormula'>$Ax + By = C&#10;$</span>
.</li>
<li>The standard form is useful in calculating the zero of an equation. For a linear equation in standard form, if  <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is nonzero, then the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept occurs at <span class='clFormula'>$x = \frac{C}{A}$</span>
. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dt>y-intercept</dt>
<dd>A point at which a line crosses the y-axis of a Cartesian grid.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Standard Form</h3>

<p>Standard form is another way of arranging a linear equation. In the standard form, a linear equation is written as:
</p>
<p>
 <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;Ax + By = C&#10;$</span></p>


<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
are both not equal to zero. The equation is usually written so that <span class='clFormula'>$A \geq 0$</span>
, by convention. The graph of the equation is a straight line, and every straight line can be represented by an equation in the standard form. </p>
<p>For example, consider an equation in slope-intercept form: <span class='clFormula'>$y = -12x +5$</span>
. In order to write this in standard form, note that we must move the term containing <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
to the left side of the equation. We add <span class='clFormula'>$12x$</span>
to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y + 12x = 5$</div>

<p>The equation is now in standard form.</p>

<h3>Using Standard Form to Find Zeroes</h3>

<p>Recall that a zero is a point at which a function's value will be equal to zero (<span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
), and is the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept of the function. We know that the y-intercept of a linear equation can easily be found by putting the equation in slope-intercept form. However, the zero of the equation is not immediately obvious when the linear equation is in this form. However, the zero, or <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept of a linear equation can easily be found by putting it into standard form.</p>
<p>For a linear equation in standard form, if <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is nonzero, then the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-intercept occurs at <span class='clFormula'>$x = \frac{C}{A}$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example, consider the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y + 12x = 5$</span>
.</p>
<p>In this equation, the value of <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
is 1, and the value of <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
is 5. Therefore, the zero of the equation occurs at <span class='clFormula'>$x = \frac{5}{1} = 5$</span>
. The zero is the point <span class='clFormula'>$(5, 0)$</span>
.</p>
<p>Note that the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept and slope can also be calculated using the coefficients and constant of the standard form equation. If <span class='clFormula'>$B$</span>
is non-zero, then the <em>y</em>-intercept, that is the <em>y</em>-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the y-axis (where <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is zero), is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{C}{B}$</span>
, and the slope of the line is <span class='clFormula'>$-\frac{A}{B}$</span>
. </p>

<h3>Example: Find the zero of the equation <span class='clFormula'>$3(y - 2) = \frac{1}{4}x +3$</span></h3>

<p>We must write the equation in standard form, <span class='clFormula'>$Ax + By = C$</span>
, which means getting the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
terms on the left side, and the constants on the right side of the equation.</p>
<p>Distribute the 3 on the left side:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;3y - 6 = \frac{1}{4}x +3$</div>

<p>Add 6 to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;3y = \frac{1}{4}x + 9$</div>

<p>Subtract <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{4}x$</span>
from both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;3y - \frac{1}{4}x = 9$</div>

<p>The equation is in standard form, and we can substitute the values for <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
into the formula for the zero:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;x &amp;= \frac{C}{A} \\&amp;= \frac{9}{3} \\&amp;= 3&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The zero is <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 0)$</span>

<h3>The Distance Formula</h3>

<p>In analytic geometry, the distance between two points of the <span class='clFormula'>$xy$</span>
-plane can be found using the distance formula.  The distance can be from two points on a line or from two points on a line segment.  The distance between points <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1},y_{1})$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{2},y_{2})$</span>
is given by the formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;d=\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$</div>

<p>This formula is easily derived by constructing a right triangle with the hypotenuse connecting the two points (<span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
) and two legs drawn from the each of the two points to intersect each other (<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
), (see image below) and applying the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides . </p>

and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{2},y_{2})$</span>
, shown as the hypotenuse of a right triangle</p>

<h3>Example:  Find the distance between the points <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(5,8)$</span></h3>

<p>Substitute the values into the distance formula that is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;d=\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;d&amp;=\sqrt{(5-2)^{2}+(8-4)^{2}}\\&amp;=\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}\\&amp;=\sqrt{25}\\&amp;=5&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<h3>Midpoint of a Line Segment</h3>

<p>In geometry, the midpoint is the middle point of a line segment, or the middle point of two points on a line, and thus is equidistant from both end-points. If you have two points, <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{1},y_{1})$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(x_{2},y_{2})$</span>
, the midpoint of the segment connecting the two points can be found with the formula: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2})$</div>

<p>Another way to interpret this formula is an average: we average the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates to find the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate of the midpoint, and we average the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates to find the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate of the midpoint.</p>
<p>By looking at each coordinate, you can see that the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate  is halfway between <span class='clFormula'>$x_{1}$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x_{2}$</span>
, and the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate is halfway between <span class='clFormula'>$y_{1}$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y_{2}$</span>
.</p>

<blockquote>Parallel lines never intersect; perpendicular lines intersect at right angles.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice finding equations for lines that are parallel and lines that are perpendicular</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Any two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. </li>
<li>Two lines in the same plane are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. This means that one has slope of <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
and the other has a slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-\frac{1}{m}$</span>
.</li>
<li>Two lines in the same plane are perpendicular if the product of their slopes equals <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>parallel lines</dt>
<dd>Lines which never intersect even as they go to infinity. Their slopes are equal to each other.</dd>
<dt>perpendicular lines</dt>
<dd>Two lines whose intersection creates right angles. Their slopes are the negative reciprocal of each other.</dd>
<dt>reciprocal</dt>
<dd>Of a number, the number obtained by dividing <equation>$1$</equation> by the given number; the result of exchanging the numerator and the denominator of a fraction.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Parallel Lines</h3>

<p>Two lines in a plane that do not intersect or touch at a point are called parallel lines. The parallel symbol is <span class='clFormula'>$\parallel$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example, given two lines:  <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=m_{1}x+b_{1}$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=m_{2}x+b_{2}$</span>
, writing <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span><span class='clFormula'>$\parallel$</span><span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
states that the two lines are parallel to each other.  In 2D, two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. </p>
<p>Given two parallel lines <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
, the following is true:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every point on <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
is located at exactly the same minimum distance from <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
.</li>
<li>Line <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)$</span>
is on the same plane as <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
 but does not intersect <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)$</span>
, even assuming that the two lines extend to infinity in either direction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recall that the slope-intercept form of an equation is: <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
and the point-slope form of an equation is: <span class='clFormula'>$y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})$</span>
, both contain information about the slope, namely the constant <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
. If two lines, say <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=mx+b$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=nx+c$</span>
, are parallel, then <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
must equal <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
.</p>
<p>For example, in the graph below, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=2x+3$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=2x-1$</span>
are parallel since they have the same slope, <span class='clFormula'>$m=2$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0518.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0518.png' alt='Parallel lines'></a>

<div><b><i>Parallel lines</i></b></div>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=2x+3$</span>
 in red is parallel to <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=2x-1$</span>
 in blue; the slopes obtained from the graphs of the lines is the same as the slopes in their equations.</p>


<h3>Perpendicular Lines</h3>

<p>Two lines are perpendicular to each other if they form congruent adjacent angles. In other words, they are perpendicular if the angles at their intersection are right angles, <span class='clFormula'>$90$</span>
degrees . The perpendicular symbol is <span class='clFormula'>$\perp$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example given two lines, <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=m_{1}x+b_{1}$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=m_{2}x+b_{2}$</span>
, writing<span class='clFormula'>$f(x)\perp g(x)$</span>
states that the two lines are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p>For two lines in a 2D plane to be perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of one another, or the product of their slopes must equal <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
.  This means that if the slope of one line is <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, then the slope of its perpendicular line is <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{-1}{m}$</span>
. The two slopes multiplied together must equal <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).  </p>
<p>Given two lines: <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=3x-2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=\frac{-1}{3}x+1$</span>
, note the values of the slopes.  Since <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
 is the negative reciprocal of <span class='clFormula'>$-\frac{1}{3}$</span>
, the two lines are perpendicular. Also, the product of the slopes equals <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
. </p>



<a href='../images/0519.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0519.png' alt='Perpendicular lines'></a>

<div><b><i>Perpendicular lines</i></b></div>
<p>The line <span class='clFormula'>$f(x)=3x-2$</span>
 in red is perpendicular to line <span class='clFormula'>$g(x)=\frac{-1}{3}x+1$</span>
 in blue. The values of their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other; therefore, the angle of intersection is <span class='clFormula'>$90$</span>
 degrees.</p>


<h3>Writing Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h3>

<h3>Example:  Write an equation of the line (in slope-intercept form) that is parallel to the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=-2x+4$</span>
 and passes through the point <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,1)$</span>
 </h3>

<p>Start with the equation for slope-intercept form and then substitute the values for the slope and the point, and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
:  <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
.  The value of the slope will be equal to the current line, since the new line is parallel to it.  The point <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,1)$</span>
 is substituted for <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=mx+b$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;1&amp;=-2(-1)+b\\&#10;\\&#10;1&amp;=2+b\\&#10;\\&#10;b&amp;=-1&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore, the equation of the line has a slope (<span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
) of  <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
 and a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept (<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) of <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
.  The equation is <span class='clFormula'>$y=-2x-1$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example:  Write an equation of the line (in slope-intercept form) that is perpendicular to the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=\frac{1}{4}x-3$</span>
 and passes through the point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4)$</span></h3>

<p>Again, start with the slope-intercept form and substitute the values, except the value for the slope will be the negative reciprocal.  The negative reciprocal of <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{1}{4}$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
.  Therefore, the new equation has a slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
, through the point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4)$</span>
.  Solve for <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;4&amp;=-4(2)+b\\&#10;\\&#10;4&amp;=-8+b\\&#10;\\&#10;b&amp;=12&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore, the equation of the line perpendicular to the given line has a slope of <span class='clFormula'>$-4$</span>
 and a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept of <span class='clFormula'>$12$</span>
.  The equation is <span class='clFormula'>$y=-4x+12$</span>
. </p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>When two expressions are connected by any of the following signs: <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>

, <span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
 , <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$\ne$</span>
 we have an inequality. For inequalities that contain variable expressions, you may be asked to solve the inequality for that variable. This just means that you need to find the values of the variable that make the inequality true.</li>
<li>A linear inequality is solved very similarly to how we solve equations. The difference is that the answers are more than one true value, they can be any of the following: <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>

<h3>Linear Inequalities</h3>

<p>When two linear expressions are not equal, but are designated as less than (<span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
), greater than (<span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
), less than or equal to (<span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
) or greater than or equal to (<span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
), it is called a linear inequality.  A linear inequality looks exactly like a linear equation, with the inequality sign replacing the equality sign.</p>
<p>For inequalities that contain variable expressions, you may be asked to solve the inequality for that variable. This just means that you need to find the values of the variable that make the inequality true.  </p>
<p>A linear inequality looks like a linear equation, with the inequality sign replacing the equal sign.  The same properties for solving an equation are used to solve an inequality; however, when solving an equation there is one solution (or one value that makes the equation true), but when solving an inequality there are many solutions (or values that make the statement true).</p>

<h3>Solutions of Linear Inequalities</h3>

<h3>Example: Graph the solutions of the inequality: <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;4$</span></h3>

<p>The solutions to this inequality includes every number that is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
as shown below.</p>



<a href='../images/0520.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0520.png' alt='Inequality'></a>

<div><b><i>Inequality</i></b></div>
<p>Solutions to <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;4$</span>
are graphed in yellow on the number line.  Notice the open circle means that the value of <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 in not a solution to the inequality since <span class='clFormula'>$4&gt;4$</span>
 is a false statement.  If the inequality was <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq 4$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 would be a solution and there would be a closed circle over the <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
 on the number line.</p>


<h3>Solving Linear Inequalities</h3>

<p>Solving the inequality is the same as solving an equation.  There is only one rule that is different: When you multiply or divide each side of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality symbol to maintain a true statement.  </p>

<h3>Example:  Solve the inequality: <span class='clFormula'>$-7x+3+x \leq 1-4x-10$</span></h3>

<p>Step 1, combine like terms on each side of the inequality symbol:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-6x+3\leq-4x-9$</div>

<p>Step 2, since there is a variable on both sides of the inequality, choose to move the  <span class='clFormula'>$-4x$</span>
, to combine the variables on the left hand side of the inequality. </p>
<p>Adding <span class='clFormula'>$4x$</span>
 yields: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-2x+3\leq-9$</span>
   </p>
<p>Step 3, this is similar to solving a two step equation. Subtract <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;-2x\leq-12$</span></p>
<p>Finally, divide both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
 (remember to reverse the inequality symbol):</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x\ge 6$</span>
 </p>
<p>To read this answer, read from right to left, <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq6$</span>
. This reads "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is greater than or equal to 6". </p>
<h2 id='section_37'>5.3. Applications of Linear Functions</h2>

<h3 id='concept_103'>5.3.1. Rates of Change</h3>

<blockquote>Linear functions apply to real world problems that involve a constant rate.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Apply linear equations to solve problems about rates of change</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you know a real-world problem is  linear, such as the distance you travel when you go for a jog, you can graph the function and make some assumptions with only two points.</li>
<li>The slope of a function is the same as the rate of change for the dependent variable <span class='clFormula'>$(y)$</span>
. For instance, if you're graphing distance vs. time, then the slope is how fast your distance is changing with time, or in other words, your velocity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>slope</dt>
<dd>The ratio of the vertical and horizontal distances between two points on a line; zero if the line is horizontal, undefined if it is vertical.</dd>
<dt>rate of change</dt>
<dd>Ratio between two related quantities that are changing.
</dd>
<dt>linear equation</dt>
<dd>A polynomial equation of the first degree (such as <equation>$x=2y-7$</equation>).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Rate of Change</h3>

<p>Linear equations often include a rate of change.  For example, the rate at which distance changes over time is called velocity.  If two points in time and the total distance traveled is known the rate of change, also known as slope, can be determined.  From this information, a linear equation can be written and then predictions can be made from the equation of the line.  
</p>
<p>If the unit or quantity in respect to which something is changing is not specified, usually the rate is per unit of time. The most common type of rate is "per unit of time", such as speed, heart rate and flux. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include exchange rates, literacy rates, and electric field (in volts/meter).</p>
<p>In describing the units of a rate, the word "per" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate (for example a heart rate is expressed "beats per minute").</p>

<h3>Rate of Change: Real World Application</h3>

<h3>Example </h3>

<p>An athlete begins he normal practice for the next marathon during the evening. At 6:00 pm he starts to run and leaves his home.  At  7:30 pm, the athlete finishes the run at home and has run a total of  7.5 miles. How fast was his average speed over the course of the run?</p>
<p>The rate of change is the speed of his run; distance over time. Therefore, the two variables are time <span class='clFormula'>$(x)$</span>
 and distance <span class='clFormula'>$(y)$</span>
. The first point is at his house, where his watch read 6:00 pm. This is the beginning time so let's set it to <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
.  So our first point is <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
 because he did not run anywhere yet. Let's think about our time in hours.  Our second point is <span class='clFormula'>$1.5$</span>
hours later, and we ran <span class='clFormula'>$7.5$</span>
miles. The second point is <span class='clFormula'>$(1.5,7.5)$</span>
. Our speed (rate of change) is simply the slope of the line connecting the two points. The slope, given by: <span class='clFormula'>$m = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$</span>
becomes <span class='clFormula'>$m = \frac{7.5}{1.5}=5 $</span>
 miles per hour.</p>

<h3>Example:  Graph the line illustrating speed</h3>

<p> To graph this line, we need the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept and the slope to write the equation. The slope was <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 miles per hour and since the starting point was at <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
, the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. So our final function is <span class='clFormula'>$y=5x$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0521.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0521.png' alt='Distance and time graph'></a>

<div><b><i>Distance and time graph</i></b></div>
<p>The graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=5x$</span>
. The two variables are time <span class='clFormula'>$(x)$</span>
 and distance <span class='clFormula'>$(y)$</span>
.  The rate the runner runs is <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 miles per hour.  Using the graph, predictions can be made assuming that his average speed remains the same.</p>

<p>With this new function, we can now answer some more questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
How many miles did he run after the first half hour?  Using the equation, if <span class='clFormula'>$x=\frac{1}{2}$</span>
, solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.  If <span class='clFormula'>$y=5x$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=5(0.5)=2.5$</span>
 miles.</li>
<li>If he kept running at the same pace for a total of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
hours, how many miles will he have run? If <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
, solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.  If <span class='clFormula'>$y=5x$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=5(3)=15$</span>
 miles. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many such applications for linear equations. Anything that involves a constant rate of change can be nicely represented with a line with the slope. Indeed, so long as you have just two points, if you know the function is linear, you can graph it and begin asking questions! Just make sure what you're asking and graphing makes sense. For instance, in the marathon example, the domain is really only <span class='clFormula'>$x\geq0$</span>
, since it doesn't make sense to go into negative time and lose miles!</p>

<h3>Mathematical Models</h3>

<p>A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. Mathematical models are used not only in the natural sciences and  engineering disciplines, but also in the social sciences. Linear modeling can include population change, telephone call charges, the cost of renting a bike, weight management, or fundraising. A linear model includes the rate of change <span class='clFormula'>$(m)$</span>
 and the initial amount, the y-intercept <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. After the model is written and a graph of the line is made, either one can be used to make predictions about behaviors.</p>

<h3>Real Life Linear Model</h3>

<p>Many everyday activities require the use of mathematical models, perhaps unconsciously. One difficulty with mathematical models lies in translating the real world application into an accurate mathematical representation. </p>

<h3>Example: Renting a Moving Van  
</h3>

<p>A rental company charges a flat fee of <span class='clFormula'>$\$30$</span>
and an additional <span class='clFormula'>$\$0.25$</span>
per mile to rent a moving van.
Write a linear equation to approximate the cost <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 (in dollars) in terms of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, the number of miles driven. How much would a 75 mile trip cost?  </p>
<p>Using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, with the total cost labeled <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 (dependent variable) and the miles labeled <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 (independent variable):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=mx+b$</div>

<p>The total cost is equal to the rate per mile times the number of miles driven plus the cost for the flat fee: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y=0.25x+30$</span></p>
<p>To calculate the cost of a <span class='clFormula'>$75 $</span>
 mile trip, substitute <span class='clFormula'>$75$</span>
 for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 into the equation:</p>
<p>  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=0.25x+30\\&#10;&amp;=0.25(75)+30\\&#10;&amp;=18.75+30\\&#10;&amp;=48.75&#10;\end{align}$</span></p>

<h3>Real life Model with Multiple Equations</h3>

<p>It's also possible to model multiple lines and their equations.</p>

<h3>Example  </h3>

<p>Initially, trains A and B are <span class='clFormula'>$325$</span>
miles away from each other. Train A is traveling towards B at <span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
miles per hour and train B is traveling towards A at <span class='clFormula'>$80$</span>
miles per hour.  At what time will the two trains meet? At this time how far did the trains travel?</p>
<p>First, begin with the starting positions of the trains,  (<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercepts, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
). Train A starts are the origin, <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
. Since train B is <span class='clFormula'>$325$</span>
miles away from train A initially, its position is <span class='clFormula'>$(0,325)$</span>
. </p>
<p>Second, in order to write the equations representing each train's total distance in terms of time, calculate the rate of change for each train. Since train A is traveling towards train B, which has a greater <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
value, train A's rate of change must be positive and equal to its speed of <span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
. Train B is traveling towards A, which has a lesser <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
value, giving B a negative rate of change: <span class='clFormula'>$-80$</span>
.</p>
<p>The two lines are thus: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;&#10;y_A=50x\\&#10;&#10;$</div>

<p>And:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10; y_B=-80x+325$</div>

<p>The two trains will meet where the two lines intersect.  To find where the two lines intersect set the equations equal to each other and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;y_{A}=y_{B}$</span>
  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;50x=-80x+325$</div>

<p>Solving for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
gives:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;x=2.5$</span></p>
<p>The two trains meet after <span class='clFormula'>$2.5$</span>
hours. To find where this is, plug <span class='clFormula'>$2.5$</span>
into either equation.</p>
<p>Plugging it into the first equation gives us <span class='clFormula'>$50(2.5)=125$</span>
, which means it meets after A travels <span class='clFormula'>$125$</span>
miles.</p>
<p>Here is the distance versus time graphic model of the two trains:</p>

<div><b><i>Trains</i></b></div>

.  The two trains meet at the intersections point <span class='clFormula'>$(2.5,125)$</span>
, which is after <span class='clFormula'>$125$</span>
 miles in <span class='clFormula'>$2.5$</span>

<h3 id='concept_108'>5.3.3. Fitting a Curve</h3>

<blockquote>Curve fitting with a line attempts to draw a line so that it "best fits" all of the data.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the least squares regression formula to calculate the line of best fit for a set of points</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Curve fitting is useful for finding a curve that best fits the data. This allows assumptions about how the data is roughly spread out and predictions about future data points.</li>
<li>Linear regression attempts to graph a line that best fits the data.</li>
<li>Ordinary least squares approximation is a type of linear regression that minimizes the sum of the squares of the difference between the approximated value (from the line), and the actual value.</li>
<li>The slope of the line that approximates <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
data points is given by <span class='clFormula'>$m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept of the line that approximates <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
data points is given by: <span class='clFormula'>$b=&#10;\displaystyle{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{1} - m \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = \left (\bar{y} - m \bar{x} \right)}&#10;$</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Curve Fitting</h3>

<p>Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a "smooth" function is constructed that approximately fits the data. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data, and is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.</p>
<p>In this section, we will only be fitting lines to data points, but it should be noted that one can fit polynomial functions, circles, piece-wise functions, and any number of functions to data and it is a heavily used topic in statistics.</p>

<h3>Linear Regression Formula</h3>

<p>Linear regression is an approach to modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable, <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
and an independent variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. With linear regression, a line in slope-intercept form, <span class='clFormula'>$y=mx+b$</span>
is found that "best fits" the data.</p>
<p>The simplest and perhaps most common linear regression model is the ordinary least squares approximation. This approximation attempts to minimize the sums of the squared distance between the line and every point.  </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}$</div>

<p>To find the slope of the line of best fit, calculate in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sum of the product of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates  <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{j}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the squares of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates squared  <span class='clFormula'>$(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The quotient of the numerator and denominator.</li>
</ol>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align} &#10;b&amp;=&#10;\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{1} - m \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\ &#10;&amp;= \left (\bar{y} - m \bar{x} \right)&#10;&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>To find the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept (<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) , calculate using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The average of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates. Let <span class='clFormula'>$\bar{y}$</span>
, pronounced <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-bar, represent the mean (or average) <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
value of all the data points:  <span class='clFormula'>$\bar y =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The average of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates. Respectively <span class='clFormula'>$\bar{x}$</span>
, pronounced <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-bar, is the mean (or average) <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
value of all the data points:  <span class='clFormula'>$\bar x=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>Replace values into the formula above <span class='clFormula'>$b=\bar{y} - m \bar{x}$</span>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Using these values of <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
we now have a line that approximates the points on the graph.  </p>

<h3>Using the Least Squares Approximation</h3>

<h3>Example:  Write the least squares fit line and then graph the line that best fits the data </h3>

<p>For <span class='clFormula'>$n=8$</span>
points:  <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,0),(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,2.5),(5,3) $</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(6,4)$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/0523.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0523.png' alt='Example Points'></a>

<div><b><i>Example Points</i></b></div>
<p>The points are graphed in a scatterplot fashion.</p>

<p>First, find the slope <span class='clFormula'>$(m)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept <span class='clFormula'>$(b)$</span>
 that best approximate this data, using the equations from the prior section:</p>
<p>To find the slope, calculate:</p>



<ol>
<li>The sum of the product of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$</span>
.</li>
<li>The sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates  <span class='clFormula'>$\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}$</span>
.</li>
</ol>





<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}&amp;=0+0+1+4+3+10+15+24\\&amp;=57&#10;\end{align}&#10;$</span><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}&amp;=-1+0+1+2+3+4+5+6\\&amp;=20&#10;\end{align}$</span><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}&amp;=0+0+1+2+1+2.5+3+4\\&amp;=13.5&#10;\end{align}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}$</div>

<p>4. Calculate the numerator:  The product of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates
minus one-eighth the product of the sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates and the sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{j}$</div>

<p>The numerator in the slope equation is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;57-\frac{1}{8}(20)(13.5)=23.25$</span></p>
<p>5. Calculate the denominator:  The
sum of the squares of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates minus one-eighth the sum of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates squared:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}$</span></p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})&amp;=1+0+1+4+9+16+25+36\\&amp;=92&#10;\end{align}$</div>

<p>The denominator is <span class='clFormula'>$92-\frac{1}{8}(20)^{2}=92-50=42$</span>
and the slope is the quotient of the numerator and denominator: <span class='clFormula'>$\frac{23.25}{42}\approx0.554.$</span></p>
<p>Now for the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-intercept, (<span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
) one-eighth times the average of the <span class='clFormula'>$$</span><span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates:  <span class='clFormula'>$\bar{x}=\frac{20}{8}=2.5$</span>
and one-eighth times the average of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates: <span class='clFormula'>$\bar{y}=\frac{13.5}{8}=1.6875$</span>
. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class='clFormula'>$b=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{1} - m \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\$</span>
:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle&#10;b\approx1.6875-0.554(2.5)=0.3025.$</span></p>
<p>Our final equation is therefore <span class='clFormula'>$y=0.554x+0.3025$</span>
, and this line is graphed along with the points.</p>



<a href='../images/0524.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0524.png' alt='Least Squares Fit Line'></a>

<div><b><i>Least Squares Fit Line</i></b></div>
<p>The line found by the least squares approximation, <span class='clFormula'>$y = 0.554x+0.3025$</span>
. Notice 4 points are above the line, and 4 points are below the line. </p>


<h3>Outliers and Least Square Regression</h3>

<p>If we have a point that is far away from the approximating line, then it will skew the results and make the line much worse.  For instance, let's say in our original example, instead of the point <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,0)$</span>
 we have <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,6)$</span>
. </p>
<p>Using the same calculations as above with the new point, the results are:<span class='clFormula'>$m\approx0.0536$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b\approx2.3035$</span>
, to get the new equation <span class='clFormula'>$y=0.0536x+2.3035$</span>
.</p>
<p>Looking at the points and line in the new figure below,  this new line does not fit the data well, due to the outlier <span class='clFormula'>$(-1,6)$</span>
.  Indeed, trying to fit linear models to data that is quadratic, cubic, or anything non-linear, or data with many outliers or errors can result in bad approximations.</p>
