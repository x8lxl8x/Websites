<h3>Sequences</h3>

<p>In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of objects. Like a set, it contains members (also called elements or terms). The number of ordered elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and a particular term can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. </p>
<p>For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(M, A, R, Y)$</span>
is a sequence of letters that differs from <span class='clFormula'>$(A, R, M, Y)$</span>
, as the ordering matters, and <span class='clFormula'>$(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)$</span>
, which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be finite, as in this example, or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers <span class='clFormula'>$(2, 4, 6, \cdots )$</span>
. Finite sequences are sometimes known as strings or words and infinite sequences as streams.</p>

<h3>Examples and Notation</h3>

<h3>Finite and Infinite Sequences</h3>

<p>A more formal definition of a finite sequence with terms in a set <span class='clFormula'>$S$</span>
is a function from <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 1, 2, \cdots, n \right \}$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$S$</span>
for some <span class='clFormula'>$n &gt; 0$</span>
. An infinite sequence in <span class='clFormula'>$S$</span>
is a function from <span class='clFormula'>$\left \{ 1, 2, \cdots \right \}$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$S$</span>
. For example, the sequence of prime numbers <span class='clFormula'>$(2,3,5,7,11, \cdots )$</span>
is the function </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$1\rightarrow 2, 2\rightarrow 3, 3\rightarrow 5, 4\rightarrow 7, 5\rightarrow 11, \cdots$</span>
 </p>
<p>A sequence of a finite length n is also called an <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
-tuple. Finite sequences include the empty sequence <span class='clFormula'>$( \quad )$</span>
that has no elements.</p>

<h3>Recursive Sequences</h3>

<p>Many of the sequences you will encounter in a mathematics course are produced by a formula, where some operation(s) is performed on the previous member of the sequence <span class='clFormula'>$a_{n-1}$</span>
to give the next member of the sequence <span class='clFormula'>$a_n$</span>
. These are called recursive sequences.</p>

<h3>Arithmetic Sequences</h3>

<p>An arithmetic (or linear) sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term. An example is <span class='clFormula'>$(10,13,16,19,22,25)$</span>
. In this example, the first term (which we will call <span class='clFormula'>$a_1$</span>
) is <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, and the <em>common </em>difference (<span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
)—that is, the difference between any two adjacent numbers—is <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
. The recursive definition is therefore </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{a_n=a_{n-1}+3, a_1=10}$</div>

<p>Another example is <span class='clFormula'>$(25,22,19,16,13,10)$</span>
. In this example <span class='clFormula'>$a_1 = 25$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$d=-3$</span>
. The recursive definition is therefore </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{a_n=a_{n-1}-3, a_1=25}$</div>

<p>In both of these examples, <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
(the number of terms) is <span class='clFormula'>$6$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Geometric Sequences</h3>

<p>A geometric sequence is a list in which each number is generated by multiplying a constant by the previous number. An example is <span class='clFormula'>$(2,6,18,54,162)$</span>
. In this example, <span class='clFormula'>$a_1=2$</span>
, and the <em>common ratio</em> (<span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
)—that is, the ratio between any two adjacent numbers—is 3. Therefore the recursive definition is </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a_n=3a_{n-1}, a_1=2$</div>

<p>Another example is <span class='clFormula'>$(162,54,18,6,2)$</span>
. In this example <span class='clFormula'>$a_1=162$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r=\frac{1}{3}}$</span>
. Therefore the recursive formula is </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{a_n=\frac13\cdot a_{n-1}, a_1=162}$</span>
 </p>
<p>In both examples <span class='clFormula'>$n=5$</span>
. </p>

<h3>Explicit Definitions</h3>

<p>An explicit definition of an arithmetic sequence is one in which the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term is defined without making reference to the previous term. This is more useful, because it means you can find (for instance) the 20th term without finding all of the other terms in between.</p>
<p>To find the explicit definition of an arithmetic sequence, you begin writing out the terms. Assume our sequence is <span class='clFormula'>$t_1, t_2, \dots $</span>
. The first term is always <span class='clFormula'>$t_1$</span>
. The second term goes up by <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
, and so it is <span class='clFormula'>$t_1+d$</span>
. The third term goes up by <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
again, and so it is <span class='clFormula'>$(t_1+d)+d,$</span>
  or in other words, <span class='clFormula'>$t_1+2d$</span>
. So we see that: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;t_1 &amp;= t_1 \\&#10;t_2 &amp;= t_1+d \\&#10;t_3 &amp;= t_1+2d \\&#10;t_4 &amp;= t_1+3d \\&#10;&amp;\vdots&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>and so on. From this you can see the generalization that: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$t_n = t_1+(n-1)d$</div>

<p>which is the explicit definition we were looking for.</p>
<p>The explicit definition of a geometric sequence is obtained in a similar way. The first term is <span class='clFormula'>$t_1$</span>
; the second term is <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
times that, or <span class='clFormula'>$t_1r$</span>
; the third term is <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
times that, or <span class='clFormula'>$t_1r^2$</span>
; and so on. So the general rule is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$t_n=t_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$</div>


<h3 id='concept_225'>12.1.2. The General Term of a Sequence</h3>

<blockquote>Given terms in a sequence, it is often possible to find a formula for the general term of the sequence, if the formula is a polynomial.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice finding a formula for the general term of a sequence</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Given terms in a sequence generated by a polynomial, there is a method to determine the formula for the polynomial.</li>
<li>By hand, one can take the differences between each term, then the differences between the differences in terms, etc. If the differences eventually become constant, then the sequence is generated by a polynomial formula.</li>
<li>Once a constant difference is achieved, one can solve equations to generate the formula for the polynomial.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>sequence</dt>
<dd>A set of things next to each other in a set order; a series</dd>
<dt>general term</dt>
<dd>A mathematical expression containing variables and constants that, when substituting integer values for each variable, produces a valid term in a sequence.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Given several terms in a sequence, it is sometimes possible to find a formula for the general term of the sequence. Such a formula will produce the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term when a value for the integer <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is put into the formula.</p>
<p>If a sequence is generated by a polynomial, this fact can be detected by noticing whether the computed differences eventually become constant.</p>

<h3>Linear Polynomials</h3>

<p>Consider the sequence:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$5, 7, 9, 11, 13, \dots$</span></p>
<p>The difference between <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. The difference between <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$9$</span>
is also <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. In fact, the difference between each pair of terms is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. Since this difference is constant, and this is the first set of differences, the sequence is given by a first-degree (linear) polynomial. </p>
<p>Suppose the formula for the sequence is given by <span class='clFormula'>$an+b$</span>
for some constants <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. Then the sequence looks like:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a+b, 2a+b, 3a+b, \dots$</div>

<p>The difference between each term and the term after it is <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
. In our example, <span class='clFormula'>$a=2$</span>
. It is possible to solve for <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
using one of the terms in the sequence. Using the first number in the sequence and the first term:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;5 &amp;= a+b \\&#10;b &amp;= 5-a \\&#10;b &amp;= 5-(2)\\&#10;b &amp;= 3&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p> So, the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term of the sequence is given by  <span class='clFormula'>$2n+3$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Quadratic Polynomials</h3>

<p>Suppose the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term of a sequence was given by <span class='clFormula'>$an^2+bn+c$</span>
. Then the sequence would look like:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a+b+c, 4a+2b+c, 9a+3b+c, \dots$</div>

<p>This sequence was created by plugging in <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, etc.</p>
<p>If we start at the second term, and subtract the previous term from each term in the sequence, we can get a new sequence made up of the differences between terms. The first sequence of differences would be:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3a+b, 5a+b, 7a+b, \dots$</div>

<p>Now, we take the differences between terms in the new sequence. The second sequence of differences is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2a, 2a, 2a, 2a, \dots$</div>

<p>The computed differences have converged to a constant after the second sequence of differences. This means that it was a second-order (quadratic) sequence. Working backward from this, we could find the general term for any quadratic sequence.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the sequence:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4, -7, -26, -53, -88, -131, \dots$</div>

<p>The difference between <span class='clFormula'>$-7$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$-11$</span>
, and the difference between  <span class='clFormula'>$-26$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-7$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$-19$</span>
. Finding all these differences, we get a new sequence:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-11, -19, -27, -35, -43, \dots$</div>

<p>This list is still not constant. However, finding the difference between terms once more, we get:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-8, -8, -8, -8, \dots$</div>

<p>This fact tells us that there is a polynomial formula describing our sequence. Since we had to do differences twice, it is a second-degree (quadratic) polynomial.</p>
<p>We can find the formula by realizing that the constant term is <span class='clFormula'>$-8$</span>
, and that it can also be expressed by <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
. Therefore <span class='clFormula'>$a=-4$</span>
. </p>
<p>Next we note that the first item in our first list of differences is <span class='clFormula'>$-11$</span>
, but that generically it is supposed to be <span class='clFormula'>$3a+b$</span>
, so we must have <span class='clFormula'>$3(-4)+b=-11$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$b=1$</span>
.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the first term in the sequence is <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
, and can also be expressed by </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a+b+c = -4+1+c$</div>

<p>So, <span class='clFormula'>$c=7$</span>
, and  the formula that generates the sequence is <span class='clFormula'>$-4a^2+b+7c$</span>
.</p>

<h3>General Polynomial Sequences</h3>

<p>This method of finding differences can be extended to find the general term of a polynomial sequence of any order. For higher orders, it will take more rounds of taking differences for the differences to become constant, and more back-substitution will be necessary in order to solve for the general term.</p>

<h3>General Terms of Non-Polynomial Sequences</h3>

<p>Some sequences are generated by a general term which is not a polynomial. For example, the geometric sequence <span class='clFormula'>$2, 4, 8, 16,\dots$</span>
is given by the general term <span class='clFormula'>$2^n$</span>
. Because this term is not a polynomial, taking differences will never result in a constant difference.</p>
<p>General terms of non-polynomial sequences can be found by observation, as above, or by other means which are beyond our scope for now. Given any general term, the sequence can be generated by plugging in successive values of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_227'>12.1.3. Series and Sigma Notation</h3>

<blockquote>Sigma notation, denoted by the uppercase Greek letter sigma <span class='clFormula'>$\left ( \Sigma \right ),$</span>
is used to represent summations—a series of numbers to be added together.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the sum of a series represented in sigma notation</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A series is a summation performed on a list of numbers. Each term is added to the next, resulting in a sum of all terms.</li>
<li>Sigma notation is used to represent the summation of a series. In this form, the capital Greek letter sigma <span class='clFormula'>$\left ( \Sigma \right )$</span>
is used. The range of terms in the summation is represented in numbers below and above the <span class='clFormula'>$\Sigma$</span>
symbol, called indices. The lowest index is written below the symbol and the largest index is written above.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>summation</dt>
<dd>A series of items to be summed or added.</dd>
<dt>sigma</dt>
<dd>The symbol <equation>$\Sigma$</equation>, used to indicate summation of a set or series.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Summation is the operation of adding a sequence of numbers, resulting in a sum or total. If numbers are added sequentially from left to right, any intermediate result is a partial sum. The numbers to be summed (called addends, or sometimes summands) may be integers, rational numbers, real numbers, or complex numbers. For finite sequences of such elements, summation always produces a well-defined sum.</p>
<p>A series is a list of numbers—like a sequence—but instead of just listing them, the plus signs indicate that they should be added up. </p>
<p>For example, <span class='clFormula'>$4+9+3+2+17$</span>
is a series. This particular series adds up to <span class='clFormula'>$35$</span>
. Another series is <span class='clFormula'>$2+4+8+16+32+64$</span>
. This series sums to <span class='clFormula'>$126$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Sigma Notation</h3>

<p>One way to compactly represent a series is with <em>sigma notation</em>, or <em>summation notation</em>, which looks like this:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\sum _{n=3}^{7}{n^2}}$</div>

<p>The main symbol seen is the uppercase Greek letter  sigma. It indicates a series. To "unpack" this notation, <span class='clFormula'>$n=3$</span>
represents the number at which to start counting (<span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
), and the <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
represents the point at which to stop. For each term, plug that value of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
into the given formula (<span class='clFormula'>$n^2$</span>
). This particular formula, which we can read as "the sum as <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 goes from <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
to <span class='clFormula'>$7$</span>
of <span class='clFormula'>$n^2$</span>
," means:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2}$</div>

<p>More generally, sigma notation can be defined as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\sum _{ i=m }^{ n }{ x_i }=x_m+x_{m+1}+x_{m+2}+...+x_{n-1}+x_n}$</div>

<p>In this formula, <em>i</em> represents the index of summation, <span class='clFormula'>$x_i$</span>
 is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series, <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
is the lower bound of summation, and <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is the upper bound of summation. The "<span class='clFormula'>$i = m$</span>
" under the summation symbol means that the index <span class='clFormula'>$i$</span>
starts out equal to <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
. The index, <span class='clFormula'>$i$</span>
, is incremented by <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
for each successive term, stopping when <span class='clFormula'>$i=n$</span><em>.</em></p>
<p>Another example is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sum_{i=3}^6 (i^2+1) &amp;= (3^2+1)+(4^2+1)+(5^2+1)+(6^2+1) \\&#10;&amp;=10+17+26+37 \\&#10;&amp;=90&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span>
 </p>
<p>This series sums to <span class='clFormula'>$90.$</span>
So we could write:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \sum_{i=3}^6 (i^2+1)=90$</div>


<h3>Other Forms of Sigma Notation</h3>

<p>Informal writing sometimes omits the definition of the index and bounds of summation when these are clear from context. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\sum x_i^2=\sum _{ i=1 }^n x_i^2}$</div>


<h3 id='concept_228'>12.1.4. Recursive Definitions</h3>

<blockquote>A recursive definition of a function defines its values for some inputs in terms of the values of the same function for other inputs.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use a recursive formula to find specific terms of a sequence</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>In mathematical logic and computer science, a recursive definition, or inductive definition, is used to define an object in terms of itself.</li>
<li>The recursive definition for an arithmetic sequence is: <span class='clFormula'>$a_n=a_{n-1}+d$</span>
. The recursive definition for a geometric sequence is: <span class='clFormula'>$a_n=r \cdot a_{n-1}$</span>
. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Recursion</h3>

<p>In mathematical logic and computer science, a recursive definition, or inductive definition, is used to define an object in terms of itself. A recursive definition of a function defines values of the function for some inputs in terms of the values of the same function for other inputs. </p>
<p>For example, the factorial function <span class='clFormula'>$n!$</span>
is defined by the rules:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$0!=1$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(n+1)!=(n+1)n!$</div>

<p>This definition is valid because, for all <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, the recursion eventually reaches the base case of <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
.</p>
<p>For example, we can compute <span class='clFormula'>$5!$</span>
 by realizing that <span class='clFormula'>$5!=5\cdot 4!$</span>
, and that <span class='clFormula'>$4!=4\cdot 3!$</span>
, and that <span class='clFormula'>$3!=3\cdot 2!$</span>
, and that <span class='clFormula'>$2!=2\cdot 1!,$</span>
 and that: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;1! &amp;=1\cdot 0! \\&#10;&amp;= 1\cdot 1 \\&#10;&amp;=1&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Putting this all together we get: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;5! &amp;=5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 \\&#10;&amp;= 120&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<h3>Recursive Formulas for Sequences</h3>

<p>When discussing arithmetic  sequences, you may have noticed that the difference between two consecutive terms in the sequence could be written in a general way:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a_n=a_{n-1}+d$</div>

<p>The above equation is an example of a recursive equation since the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term can only be calculated by considering the previous term in the sequence. Compare this with the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a_n=a_1+d(n-1).$</div>

<p>In this equation, one can directly calculate the nth-term of the arithmetic sequence without knowing the previous terms. Depending on how the sequence is being used, either the recursive definition or the non-recursive one might be more useful.</p>
<p>A recursive geometric sequence follows the formula: </p>

<p>An applied example of a geometric sequence involves  the spread of the flu virus. Suppose each infected person will infect two more people, such that the terms follow a geometric sequence.</p>



<a href='../images/1201.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1201.png' alt='The flu virus is a geometric sequence'></a>

<div><b><i>The flu virus is a geometric sequence</i></b></div>
<p>Each person infects two more people with the flu virus, making the number of recently-infected people the nth term in a geometric sequence.</p>

<p>Using this equation, the recursive equation for this geometric sequence is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a_n=2 \cdot a_{n-1}$</div>

<p>Recursive equations are extremely powerful. One can work out every term in the series just by knowing previous terms. As can be seen from the examples above, working out and using the previous term <span class='clFormula'>$a_{n-1}$</span>
can be a much simpler computation than working out <span class='clFormula'>$a_{n}$</span>
from scratch using a general formula. This means that using a recursive formula when using a computer to manipulate a sequence might mean that the calculation will be finished quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li>The behavior of the arithmetic sequence depends on the common difference <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>

<p>An arithmetic progression, or arithmetic sequence, is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence <span class='clFormula'>$5, 7, 9, 11, 13, \cdots$</span>
is an arithmetic sequence with common difference of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
.</p>
<ul>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$a_1$</span>

<li>

<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$a_n$</span>

th term of the sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of the arithmetic sequence depends on the common difference <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
.</p>
<p>If the common difference, <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive, the sequence will progress towards infinity (<span class='clFormula'>$+\infty$</span>
)</li>
<li>Negative, the sequence will regress towards negative infinity (<span class='clFormula'>$-\infty$</span>

</ul>
<p>Note that the first term in the sequence can be thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$a_1+0\cdot d,$</span>
the second term can be thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$a_1+1\cdot d,$</span>
the third term can be thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$a_1+2\cdot d, $</span>
and so the following equation gives <span class='clFormula'>$a_n$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a_n= a_1+(n-1) \cdot d$</div>

<p>Of course, one can always write out each term until getting the term sought—but if the 50th term is needed, doing so can be cumbersome.</p>

is an arithmetic progression with common difference of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Finite Summation</h3>

<p>The sum of the members of a finite arithmetic sequence is called an arithmetic series.</p>
<p>We can come up with a formula for the sum of a finite arithmetic formula by looking at the sum in two different ways. First we think of it as the sum of terms that are written in terms of <span class='clFormula'>$a_1$</span>
, so that the second term is <span class='clFormula'>$a_1+d$</span>
, the third is <span class='clFormula'>$a_1+2d$</span>
, and so on. Then our sum looks like:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$S_n = a_1 + \left(a_1 + d\right) + \left(a_1 +2d\right) + \cdots + \left[a_1 + \left(n-2\right)d\right] + \left[a_1 + \left(n-1\right)d\right]$</div>

<p>Next, we think of each term as being written in terms of the last term, <span class='clFormula'>$a_n$</span>
. Then the last term is <span class='clFormula'>$a_n$</span>
, the term before the last is <span class='clFormula'>$a_n-d$</span>
, the term before that is <span class='clFormula'>$a_n-2d$</span>
, and so on. The sum is therefore:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$S_n = \left[a_n - \left(n-1\right)d\right] + \left[a_n - \left(n-2\right)d\right] + \cdots + \left(a_n - 2d\right) + \left(a_n - d\right) + a_n$</div>

<p>Adding both sides of the two previous equations, all terms involving <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
cancel and we obtain:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2S_n = n\left(a_1 + a_n\right)$</div>

<p>Dividing both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
produces a common form of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{S_n = \left( \frac{n}{2} \right) \left (a_1 + a_n \right )}$</div>

<p>This can be thought of as <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
times the average of the first and last terms. An alternate form results from reinserting the substitution <span class='clFormula'>$a_n = a_1 + \left(n-1\right)d$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{S_n = \left ( \frac{n}{2} \right ) \left[2a_1 + \left(n-1\right)d\right]}$</div>

<p>For example, consider the arithmetic progression  <span class='clFormula'>$3,8,13,18,23, \cdots$</span>
and suppose you want to know the sum up to the <span class='clFormula'>$50$</span>
th term. Note that you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of terms you want to sum (<span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
)</li>
<li>The first term of the sequence (<span class='clFormula'>$a_1$</span>
)</li>
<li>The difference in consecutive terms (<span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the question, we know that <span class='clFormula'>$n=50$</span>
. We can  see that the first term is <span class='clFormula'>$a_1 = 3$</span>
. The difference between the terms is  <span class='clFormula'>$d = 5$</span>
. So the equation above gives: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;S_{50} &amp;=\left(\frac{50}{2}\right)\left(2 \cdot 3 + 49 \cdot 5\right) \\&#10;&amp;= 6275&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<h3>Infinite Summation</h3>

<p>An infinite arithmetic series is exactly what it sounds like: an infinite series whose terms are in an arithmetic sequence. Examples are <span class='clFormula'>$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \cdots$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$1+2+3+4+ \cdots$</span>
. The general form for an infinite arithmetic series is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^\infty{a_i} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty{\left[a_1+\left(i-1\right)d\right]}}$</div>

<p>  If <span class='clFormula'>$a_1=d=0$</span>
, then the sum of the series is <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. If either <span class='clFormula'>$a_1$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
is non-zero, then the infinite series has no sum. </p>
<p>Even if one is dealing with an infinite sequence, the sum of that sequence can still be found up to any <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term with the same equation used in a finite arithmetic sequence.</p>

<h3>Definition of Geometric Sequences</h3>

<p>A geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is an ordered list of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
. For example, the sequence <span class='clFormula'>$2, 6, 18, 54, \cdots$</span>
is a geometric progression with common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
. Similarly <span class='clFormula'>$10,5,2.5,1.25,\cdots$</span>
is a geometric sequence with common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}}$</span>
. </p>
<p>Thus, the general form of a geometric sequence is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, \cdots$</div>

<p>The <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th term of a geometric sequence with initial value <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is given by </p>

<div class='clFormula'>${ a }_{ n }=a{ r }^{ n-1 }$</div>

<p>Such a geometric sequence also follows the recursive relation: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$a_n=ra_{n-1}$</span>
 </p>
<p>for every integer <span class='clFormula'>$n\ge 1.$</span></p>

<h3>Behavior of Geometric Sequences</h3>

<p>Generally, to check whether a given sequence is geometric, one simply checks whether successive entries in the sequence all have the same ratio. The common ratio of a geometric series may be negative, resulting in an alternating sequence. An alternating sequence will have numbers that switch back and forth between positive and negative signs. For instance: <span class='clFormula'>$1,-3,9,-27,81,-243, \cdots$</span>
is a geometric sequence with common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$-3$</span>
.</p>
<p>The behavior of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio. If the common ratio is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive, the terms will all be the same sign as the initial term</li>
<li>Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative</li>
<li>Greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, there will be exponential growth towards positive infinity (<span class='clFormula'>$+\infty$</span>
)</li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, the progression will be a constant sequence</li>
<li>Between <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
but not <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
, there will be exponential decay toward <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
, the progression is an alternating sequence (see alternating series)</li>
<li>Less than <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
, for the absolute values there is exponential growth toward positive and negative infinity (due to the alternating sign)</li>
</ul>
<p>Geometric sequences (with common ratio not equal to <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
) show exponential growth or exponential decay, as opposed to the linear growth (or decline) of an arithmetic progression such as <span class='clFormula'>$4, 15, 26, 37, 48, \cdots$</span>
(with common difference <span class='clFormula'>$11$</span>
). This result was taken by T.R. Malthus as the mathematical foundation of his Principle of Population. Note that the two kinds of progression are related: exponentiating each term of an arithmetic progression yields a geometric progression, while taking the logarithm of each term in a geometric progression with a positive common ratio yields an arithmetic progression.</p>
<p>An interesting result of the definition of a geometric progression is that for any value of the common ratio, any three consecutive terms <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
will satisfy the following equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>${b}^{2}=ac$</div>

<p>Geometric series are examples of  infinite series with finite sums, although not all of them have this property. Historically, geometric series played an important role in the early development of calculus, and they continue to be central in the study of the convergence of series. Geometric series are used throughout mathematics, and they have important applications in physics, engineering, biology, economics, computer science, queueing theory, and finance.</p>
<p>The terms of a geometric series form a geometric progression, meaning that the ratio of successive terms in the series is constant. For example, the following series:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+ \cdots=\sum _{ n=0 }^{ \infty }{ \frac { 1 }{ { 2 }^{ n } } }}$</div>

<p>is geometric, because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}}$</span>
. </p>
<p>The general form of an infinite geometric series is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\sum _{ n=0 }^{ \infty }{ { z }^{ n } }}$</div>

<p>It is possible to visualize this concept with a diagram:</p>

, and the area of the second square is <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}}$</span>
. </p>

<p>The following are several geometric series with different common ratios. The behavior of the terms depends on the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$4+40+400+4000+\dots$</span>
 has the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{9+3+1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{9}+\dots}$</span>
 has the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>${\frac{1}{3}}$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$3+3+3+3+\dots$</span>
 has the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4} -\frac{1}{8}+\dots}$</span>
 has the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$-\frac{1}{2}$</span></li>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$3-3+3-3+\dots$</span>
 has the common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The value of <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
provides information about the nature of the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is between <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$+1$</span>
, the terms of the series become smaller and smaller, approaching zero in the limit, and the series converges to a sum. Consider a sequence where <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is one-half <span class='clFormula'>${\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \cdots \right)}$</span>
, which has a sum of one.</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
or less than <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
, the terms of the series become larger and larger in magnitude. The sum of the terms also gets larger and larger, and the series has no sum. The series diverges.</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is equal to <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, all of the terms of the series are the same. The series diverges.</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$-1$</span>
, the terms take two values alternately <span class='clFormula'>$\left(\text{e.g.}, 2,-2,2,-2,2,-2,\cdots \right)$</span>
. The sum of the terms oscillates between two values <span class='clFormula'>$\left(\text{e.g.}, 2,0,2,0,2,0,\cdots \right)$</span>
. This is a different type of divergence and again the series has no sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use a formula to find the sum of a finite number of terms in a sequence. For <span class='clFormula'>$r\neq 1$</span>
, the sum of the first <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
terms of a geometric series is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;s &amp;= {a+ar+a{ r }^{ 2 }+a{ r }^{ 3 }+\cdots +a{ r }^{ n-1 } } \\&#10;&amp;=\sum _{ k=0 }^{ n-1 }{ a{ r }^{ k } } \\&#10;&amp;= a\frac { 1-{ r }^{ n } }{ 1-r } &#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is the first term of the series, and <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
is the common ratio. </p>
<p>Therefore, by utilizing the common ratio and the first term of the sequence, we can sum the first <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
terms.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric sequence <span class='clFormula'>$\left(6, 18, 54, 162, \cdots \right)$</span>
.</p>
<p>In this case, <span class='clFormula'>$a=6$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$n=5$</span>
. Also, note that <span class='clFormula'>$r = 3$</span>
, because each term is multiplied by a factor of <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
to find the subsequent term.</p>
<p>Substituting these values into the sum formula, we have: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;s &amp;= a\frac { 1-{ r }^{ n } }{ 1-r }  \\&#10;&amp;= 6\cdot\frac { 1-{ 3 }^{ 5 } }{ 1-3 } \\&#10;&amp;= 6\cdot\frac {{ -242 } }{ -2 } \\&#10;&amp;= 6 \cdot 121 \\&#10;&amp;= 726&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>A geometric series is an infinite series whose terms are in a geometric progression, or whose successive terms have a common ratio. If the terms of a geometric series approach zero, the sum of its terms will be finite. As the numbers near zero, they become insignificantly small, allowing a sum to be calculated despite the series being infinite. </p>
<p>A geometric series with a finite sum is said to converge. A series converges if and only if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left | r \right | &lt; 1$</div>

<p>What follows in an example of an infinite series with a finite sum. We will calculate the sum <span class='clFormula'>$s$</span>
of the following series:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{s = 1+\frac { 2 }{ 3 } +\frac { 4 }{ 9 } +\frac { 8 }{ 27 } + \cdots}$</div>

<p>This series has common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{2}{3}}$</span>
. If we multiply through by this common ratio, then the initial term <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
becomes <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{2}{3}}$</span>
, the <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{2}{3}}$</span>
becomes <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{4}{9}}$</span>
, and so on:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{2}{3} s = \frac { 2 }{ 3 } +\frac { 4 }{ 9 } +\frac { 8 }{ 27 } +\frac { 16 }{ 81 } + \cdots}$</div>

<p>This new series is the same as the original, except that the first term is missing. Subtracting the new series <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{2}{3}s}$</span>
from the original series, <span class='clFormula'>$s$</span>
cancels every term in the original but the first:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;s-\frac{2}{3}s &amp;=1 \\&#10;\therefore s &amp;= 3&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>A similar technique can be used to evaluate any self-similar expression.</p>
<p>A formula can be derived to calculate the sum of the terms of a convergent series. The formula used to sum the first <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
terms of any geometric series where <span class='clFormula'>$r\neq 1$</span>
is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle s= a\frac { 1-{ r }^{ n } }{ 1-r } $</span></p>
<p>If a series converges, we want to find the sum of not only a finite number of terms, but all of them. If <span class='clFormula'>$\left | r \right | &lt;1$</span>
, then we see that as <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
becomes very large, <span class='clFormula'>$r^n$</span>
becomes very small. We express this by writing that as  <span class='clFormula'>$n\rightarrow \infty$</span>
(as <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
approaches infinity), <span class='clFormula'>$r^n\rightarrow 0$</span>
. </p>
<p>Applying <span class='clFormula'>$r^n\rightarrow 0$</span>
, we can find a new formula for the sum of an infinitely long geometric series: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;s &amp;= a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\&#10;&amp;\rightarrow a\frac{1}{1-r} \quad \text{as } r^n\rightarrow 0\\&#10;&amp;= \frac{a}{1-r}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Therefore, for <span class='clFormula'>$|r|&lt;1$</span>
, we can write the infinite sum as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{s = \frac{a}{1-r}}$</div>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Find the sum of the infinite geometric series <span class='clFormula'>$64+ 32 + 16 + 8 + \cdots$</span></p>
<p>First, find <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
, or the constant ratio between each term and the one that precedes it:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;r &amp;= \frac{32}{64} \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{1}{2}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Substitute <span class='clFormula'>$a=64$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle r= \frac{1}{2}$</span>
into the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;s &amp;= \frac{64}{1-\frac{1}{2}} \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{64}{\frac{1}{2}} \\&#10;&amp;= 128&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

An infinite sequence of summed numbers, whose terms change progressively with a common ratio.</dd>
<dt>fractal</dt>
<dd>A  natural phenomenon or mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that can be seen at every scale.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Geometric series played an important role in the early development of calculus, and continue as a central part of the study of the convergence of series. Geometric series are used throughout mathematics. They have important applications in physics, engineering, biology, economics, computer science, queueing theory, and finance.</p>
<p>Geometric series are one of the simplest examples of infinite series with finite sums, although not all of them have this property.</p>

<h3>Repeating Decimal</h3>

<p>A repeating decimal can be thought of as a geometric series whose common ratio is a power of <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{10}}$</span>
. For example:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0.7777 \cdots = \frac{7}{10} + \frac{7}{100}+ \frac{7}{1000}+ \frac{7}{10000}+ \cdots}$</div>

<p>The formula for the sum of a geometric series can be used to convert the decimal to a fraction:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;0.7777 \cdots &amp;= \frac { a }{ 1-r } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac { \frac{ 7 }{ 10 } }{ 1-\frac{ 1 }{ 10 } } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)}{\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)} \\&#10;&amp;= \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)\left(\frac{10}{9}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \frac { 7 }{ 9 }&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>The formula works for any repeating term. Some more examples are:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;0.123412341234 \cdots &amp;= \frac { a }{ 1-r } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac { \frac{1234}{ 10000 } }{ 1-\frac{ 1 }{ 10000 } } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{\left(\frac{1234}{ 10000 }\right)}{\left(\frac{9999}{10000}\right)} \\&#10;&amp;= \left(\frac{1234}{ 10000 }\right)\left(\frac{10000}{9999}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \frac { 1234 }{ 9999 }&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;0.0909090909 \cdots &amp;= \frac { a }{ 1-r } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac { \frac{9}{ 100 } }{ 1-\frac{ 1 }{ 100 } } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{\left(\frac{9}{ 100 }\right)}{\left(\frac{99}{100}\right)} \\&#10;&amp;= \left(\frac{9}{100}\right)\left(\frac{100}{99}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \frac { 9 }{ 99 } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{1}{11}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;0.143814381438 \cdots &amp;= \frac { a }{ 1-r } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac { \frac{1438}{ 10000 } }{ 1-\frac{ 1 }{ 10000 } } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{\left(\frac{1438}{ 10000 }\right)}{\left(\frac{9999}{10000}\right)} \\&#10;&amp;= \left(\frac{1438}{ 10000 }\right)\left(\frac{10000}{9999}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \frac { 1438 }{ 9999 }&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;0.9999 \cdots &amp;= \frac { a }{ 1-r } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac { \frac{ 9 }{ 10 } }{ 1-\frac{ 1 }{ 10 } } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)}{\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)} \\&#10;&amp;= \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)\left(\frac{10}{9}\right)\\&#10;&amp;= \frac { 9 }{ 9 } \\&#10;&amp;= 1&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>That is, a repeating decimal with a repeating part of length <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is equal to the quotient of the repeating part (as an integer) and <span class='clFormula'>$10^n - 1$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Archimedes' Quadrature of the Parabola</h3>

<p>Archimedes used the sum of a geometric series to compute the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line. His method was to dissect the area into an infinite number of triangles. </p>



<a href='../images/1203.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1203.png' alt='Archimedes' Theorem'></a>

<div><b><i>Archimedes' Theorem</i></b></div>
<p>Archimedes' dissection of a parabolic segment into infinitely many triangles.</p>

<p>Archimedes' Theorem states that the total area under the parabola is <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{4}{3}}$</span>
of the area of the blue triangle. He determined that each green triangle has <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{8}}$</span>
the area of the blue triangle, each yellow triangle has <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{8}}$</span>
the area of a green triangle, and so forth. Assuming that the blue triangle has area <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, the total area is an infinite series:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{1+2 \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 8 } \right ) +4 { \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 8 } \right ) }^{ 2 }+8{ \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 8 } \right ) }^{ 3 }+ \cdots}$</div>

<p>The first term represents the area of the blue triangle, the second term the areas of the two green triangles, the third term the areas of the four yellow triangles, and so on. Simplifying the fractions gives:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{1+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{16}+ \frac{1}{64}+ \cdots}$</div>

<p>This is a geometric series with common ratio <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{4}}$</span>
, and the fractional part is equal to <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{3}}$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Fractal Geometry</h3>




<a href='../images/1204.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1204.png' alt='Koch snowflake'></a>

<div><b><i>Koch snowflake</i></b></div>
<p>The interior of a Koch snowflake is comprised of an infinite amount of triangles.</p>

<p>The Koch snowflake is a fractal shape with an interior comprised of an infinite amount of triangles. In the study of fractals, geometric series often arise as the perimeter, area, or volume of a self-similar figure. In the case of the Koch snowflake, its area can be described with a geometric series.</p>



<a href='../images/1205.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1205.png' alt='Constructing the Koch snowflake: the first four iterations'></a>

<div><b><i>Constructing the Koch snowflake: the first four iterations</i></b></div>
<p>Each iteration adds a set of triangles to the outside of the shape.</p>

<p>The area inside the Koch snowflake can be described as the union of an infinite number of equilateral triangles. In the diagram above, the triangles added in the second iteration are exactly <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{3}}$</span>
the size of a side of the largest triangle, and therefore they have exactly <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{9}}$</span>
the area. Similarly, each triangle added in the second iteration has  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{1}{9}}$</span>
the area of the triangles added in the previous iteration, and so forth. Taking the first triangle as a unit of area, the total area of the snowflake is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{1+3 \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 9 } \right ) +12{ \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 9 } \right ) }^{ 2 }+48{ \left ( \frac { 1 }{ 9 } \right ) }^{ 3 }+ \cdots}$</div>

<p>The first term of this series represents the area of the first triangle, the second term the total area of the three  triangles added in the second iteration, the third term the total area of the twelve triangles added in the third iteration, and so forth. Excluding the initial term <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, this series is geometric with constant ratio <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r = \frac{4}{9}}$</span>
. The first term of the geometric series is <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{a = 3 \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}}$</span>
, so the sum is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;1+ \frac { a }{ 1-r } &amp;=1+ \frac { \frac{1}{3} }{ 1- \frac{4}{9} } \\&#10;&amp;= \frac{8}{5}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Thus the Koch snowflake has <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{8}{5}}$</span>
of the area of the base triangle.</p>

<h3>Zeno's Paradoxes</h3>

<p>Zeno's Paradoxes are a set of philosophical problems devised by an ancient Greek philosopher to support the doctrine that the truth is contrary to one's senses. Simply stated, one of Zeno's paradoxes says: There is a point, A, that wants to move to another point, B. If A only moves half of the distance between it and point B at a time, it will never get there, because you can continue to divide the remaining space in half forever. Zeno's mistake is in the assumption that the sum of an infinite number of finite steps cannot be finite. We now know that his paradox is not true, as evidenced by the convergence of the geometric series with <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r = \frac{1}{2}}$</span>
. This problem has been solved by modern mathematics, which can apply the concept of infinite series to find a sum of the distances traveled. </p>

<h3 id='concept_236'>12.4.1. Sequences of Mathematical Statements</h3>

<blockquote>Sequences of statements are logical, ordered groups of statements that are important for mathematical induction.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Discuss what is meant by a sequence of mathematical statements</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A sequence is an ordered list of objects or events. Like a set, it contains members, but unlike a set, the order of the members matters.</li>
<li>A sequence of statements refers to the progression of logical implications of one statement.</li>
<li>Sequences of statements are important for mathematical inductions, which rely on infinite sequences of statements.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>set</dt>
<dd>A collection of zero or more objects, possibly infinite in size, and disregarding any order or repetition of the objects that may be contained within it.</dd>
<dt>natural numbers</dt>
<dd>A set of numbers sometimes described as all non-negative integers <equation>$(0, 1, 2, ...)$</equation> and sometimes described as all positive integers <equation>$(1, 2, 3, ...)$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of objects, or elements. The length of a sequence is the number of ordered elements, and it may be infinite. Unlike a set, order matters in sequences, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. A sequence is a discrete function. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$\left ( M,A,R,Y \right )$</span>
is a sequence of letters that differs from <span class='clFormula'>$\left ( A,R,M,Y \right )$</span>
. Although the composition is the same, the ordering differs. Sequences can be finite, as in this example, or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers <span class='clFormula'>$(2,4,6, \cdots )$</span>
. </p>
<p>In mathematics, a "sequence of statements" refers to the progression of logical implications of one statement. In this case, a "statement" usually refers to an equation that contains an equal sign. Sequences of statements are necessary for mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof typically used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers. It is done by proving that the first statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, and then proving that if any one statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, then so is the next one.</p>
<p>For example, in the context of mathematical induction, a sequence of statements usually involves an algebraic statement into which you can substitute any natural number <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 1, 2, 3, ...)$</span>
and the statement should hold true. So a sequence is formed by substituting integers <span class='clFormula'>$k$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$k + 1 $</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$k + 2$</span>
and so on into the mathematical statement. This concept will be expanded on in the following concept, which introduces proof by mathematical induction. </p>

<h3 id='concept_237'>12.4.2. Proof by Mathematical Induction</h3>

<blockquote>Proving an infinite sequence of statements is necessary for proof by induction, a rigorous form of deductive reasoning.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<dd>The process of making inferences based upon observed patterns, or simple repetition. Often used in reference to predictions about what will happen or does happen, based upon what has happened.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof typically used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (non-negative integers). It is done by proving that the first statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, and then proving that if any one statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, then so is the next one.</p>
<p>The simplest and most common form of mathematical induction proves that a statement involving a natural number <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
 holds for all values of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
. The proof consists of two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The basis (base case): showing that the statement holds when <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is equal to the lowest value that <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is given in the question. Usually, <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$n=1$</span>
.</li>
<li>The inductive step: showing that if the statement holds for some <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, then the statement also holds when <span class='clFormula'>$n+1$</span>
 is substituted for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>The assumption in the inductive step that the statement holds for some <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, is called the induction hypothesis (or inductive hypothesis). To perform the inductive step, one assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption to prove the statement for <span class='clFormula'>$n+1$</span>
.</p>
<p>The choice between <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$n=1$</span>
in the base case is specific to the context of the proof: If <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
is considered a natural number, as is common in the fields of combinatorics and mathematical logic, then <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
. If, on the other hand, <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
is taken as the first natural number, then the base case is given by <span class='clFormula'>$n=1$</span>
.</p>
<p>This method works by first proving the statement is true for a starting value, and then proving that the process used to go from one value to the next is valid. If these are both proven, then any value can be obtained by performing the process repeatedly. </p>

<h3>Visualization</h3>

<p>It may be helpful to think of the domino effect. If one is presented with a long row of dominoes standing on end, one can be sure that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first domino will fall</li>
<li>Whenever a domino falls, its next neighbor will also fall</li>
</ol>
<p>So it is concluded that all of the dominoes will fall, and that this fact is inevitable.</p>



<a href='../images/1206.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1206.png' alt='Dominoes'></a>

<div><b><i>Dominoes</i></b></div>
<p>Mathematical induction can be informally illustrated by reference to the sequential effect of falling dominoes.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Prove the following statement: For each positive integer <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
,</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$</div>

<p>Base Case: We first have to check that the statement holds for <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
. On the left-hand side of the equation, we have only <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. On the right hand side of the equation we substitute <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
. Thus we have  <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 = \frac{0(0+1)}{2}}$</span>
, which can be simplified to <span class='clFormula'>$0= 0$</span>
. We have proven that the statement holds true for the base case of <span class='clFormula'>$n=0$</span>
.</p>
<p>Inductive Step: Assume that the statement holds for <span class='clFormula'>$n=k$</span>
, and check if it holds for <span class='clFormula'>$n=k+1$</span>
as well. In other words, we want to show that the statement holds true when we substitute <span class='clFormula'>$k+1$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left[\left(k+1\right)+1\right]}{2}}$</div>

<p> Note that we can use the induction hypothesis that the statement holds for <span class='clFormula'>$n=k$</span>
to rewrite the left-hand side of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}} + (k+1)$</div>

<p>We can now rewrite this statement and show that it equals the right-hand side of the previous statement. In other words, if we can show that the following holds true, we will show that <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$</span>
holds true for <span class='clFormula'>$k+1$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left[\left(k+1\right)+1\right]}{2} }$</div>

<p>We can rewrite <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)}$</span>
algebraically as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) &amp;= \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} \\&#10;&amp;=\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\&#10;&amp;=\frac{\left(k+1\right)\left[\left(k+1\right)+1\right]}{2} &#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>This is exactly we wanted to prove. We have shown that <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$</span>
holds true for any <span class='clFormula'>$n = k + 1$</span>
if it holds true for <span class='clFormula'>$n = k$</span>
. This completes the induction step. We conclude that the statement holds for every non-negative integer <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
.</p>
