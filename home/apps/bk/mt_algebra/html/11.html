<h3>Defining Conic Sections</h3>

<p>A conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic sections are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse. The circle is type of ellipse, and is sometimes considered to be a fourth type of conic section. </p>
<p>Conic sections  can be generated by
intersecting a plane with a cone. A cone has two identically shaped
parts called nappes. One nappe is what
most people mean by “cone,” and has the shape of a party hat.</p>
<p>Conic sections are generated by the intersection of a plane with a cone. If the plane is parallel to the axis of revolution (the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis), then the conic section
is a hyperbola. If the plane is parallel to the generating line, the
conic section is a parabola. If the plane is perpendicular to the axis
of revolution, the conic section is a circle. If the plane intersects
one nappe at an angle to the axis (other than <span class='clFormula'>$90^{\circ}$</span>
), then the conic section is an ellipse.</p>



<a href='../images/1101.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1101.png' alt='A cone and conic sections'></a>

<div><b><i>A cone and conic sections</i></b></div>
<p>The nappes and the four conic sections. Each conic is determined by the angle the plane makes with the axis of the cone.</p>

<h3>Common Parts of Conic Sections</h3>

<p>While each type of conic section looks very different, they have some features in common. For example, each type has at least one focus and directrix.  </p>
<p>A focus is a point about which the conic section is constructed. In other words, it is a point about which rays reflected from the curve converge.  A parabola has one focus about which the shape is constructed; an ellipse and hyperbola have two.</p>
<p>A directrix is a line used to construct and define a conic section. The distance of a directrix from a point on the conic section has a constant ratio to the distance from that point to the focus. As with the focus, a parabola has one
directrix, while ellipses and hyperbolas have two. </p>
<p>These properties that the conic sections share are often presented as the following definition, which will be developed further in the following section. A conic section is the locus of points <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
whose distance to the <em>focus</em> is a constant multiple of the distance from <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
to  the <em>directrix</em> of the conic. These distances are displayed as orange lines  for each conic section in the following diagram.</p>



<a href='../images/1102.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1102.png' alt='Parts of conic sections'></a>

<div><b><i>Parts of conic sections</i></b></div>
<p>The three conic sections with  foci and directrices labeled.</p>

<p>Each type of conic section is described in greater detail below.</p>

<h3>Parabola</h3>

<p>A parabola is the set of all points whose distance from a fixed point, called the focus, is <em>equal</em> to the distance from a fixed line, called the directrix. The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is called the vertex of the parabola.</p>
<p>In the next figure, four parabolas are graphed as they appear on the coordinate plane. They may open up, down, to the left, or to the right.</p>



<a href='../images/1103.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1103.png' alt='Four parabolas, opening in various directions'></a>

<div><b><i>Four parabolas, opening in various directions</i></b></div>
<p>The vertex lies at the midpoint between the directrix and the focus.</p>

<h3>Ellipses</h3>

<p>An ellipse is the set of all points for which the sum of the distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. In the case of an
ellipse, there are two foci, and two directrices. </p>
<p>In the next figure, a typical ellipse is graphed as it appears on the coordinate plane.</p>



<a href='../images/1104.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1104.png' alt='Ellipse '></a>

<div><b><i>Ellipse </i></b></div>
<p>The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant.</p>

<h3>Hyperbolas</h3>

<p>A hyperbola is the set of all points where the difference between their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. In the case of a
hyperbola, there are two foci and two directrices. Hyperbolas also have
two asymptotes.</p>
<p>A graph of a typical hyperbola appears in the next figure.</p>



<a href='../images/1105.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1105.png' alt='Hyperbola'></a>

<div><b><i>Hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>The difference of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci
is constant. The transverse axis is also called the major axis, and the
conjugate axis is also called the minor axis.</p>

<h3>Applications of Conic Sections</h3>

<p>Conic sections are used in many fields of study, particularly to describe shapes. For example, they are used in astronomy to describe the shapes of the orbits of  objects in space. Two massive objects in space that interact according to Newton's law of universal gravitation can move in orbits that are in the shape of conic sections. They could follow ellipses, parabolas, or hyperbolas, depending on their properties.</p>

<h3 id='concept_411'>11.1.2. Eccentricity</h3>

<blockquote>Every conic section has a constant eccentricity that provides information about its shape.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Discuss how the eccentricity of a conic section describes its behavior</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Eccentricity is a parameter associated with every conic section, and can be thought
of as a measure of how much the conic section deviates from being
circular.</li>
<li>The eccentricity  of a conic section is defined to be the distance from any point on the
conic section to its focus, divided by the perpendicular distance from
that point to the nearest directrix. </li>
<li>The value of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
can be used to determine the type of conic section. If <span class='clFormula'>$e= 1$</span>
it is a parabola, if <span class='clFormula'>$e &lt; 1$</span>
it is an ellipse, and if <span class='clFormula'>$e &gt; 1$</span>
it is a hyperbola.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>eccentricity</dt>
<dd>A parameter of a conic section that describes how much the conic section deviates from being circular.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Defining Eccentricity</h3>

<p>The eccentricity, denoted <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
, is a parameter associated with every conic section. It can be thought of as a measure of how much the conic section deviates from being circular.</p>
<p>The eccentricity  of a conic section is defined to be the distance from any point on the
conic section to its focus, divided by the perpendicular distance from
that point to the nearest directrix. The value of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
is constant for any
conic section. This property can be used as a general definition for conic sections. The value of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
can be used to determine the type of conic section as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$e = 1$</span>
, the conic is a parabola</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$e &lt; 1$</span>
, it is an ellipse</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$e &gt; 1$</span>
, it is a hyperbola</li>
</ul>
<p>The eccentricity of a circle is zero. Note that two conic sections are similar (identically shaped) if and only if they have the same eccentricity.</p>
<p>Recall that hyperbolas and non-circular ellipses have two
foci and two associated directrices, while parabolas have one focus and one
directrix. In the next figure, each type of conic section is graphed with a focus and directrix. The orange lines denote the distance between the focus and points on the conic section, as well as the distance between the same points and the directrix. These are the distances used to find the eccentricity.</p>



<a href='../images/1106.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1106.png' alt='Conic sections and their parts'></a>

<div><b><i>Conic sections and their parts</i></b></div>
<p>Eccentricity is the ratio between the distance from any point on the
conic section to its focus, and the perpendicular distance from
that point to the nearest directrix. </p>


<h3>Conceptualizing Eccentricity</h3>

<p>From the definition of a parabola, the distance from any
point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that
same point to the directrix. Therefore, by definition, the eccentricity
of a parabola must be <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>
<p>For an ellipse, the eccentricity is less than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. This means that, in the ratio that defines eccentricity, the numerator is less than the denominator. In other words, the distance between a point on a conic section and its focus is less than the distance between that point and the nearest directrix. </p>
<p>Conversely, the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
. This indicates that the distance between a point on a conic section the nearest directrix is less than the distance between that point and the focus.</p>

<h3 id='concept_412'>11.1.3. Types of Conic Sections</h3>

<blockquote>Conic sections are formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone, and their properties depend on how this intersection occurs.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Discuss the properties of different types of conic sections</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Conic sections are a particular type of shape formed by the intersection of a plane and a right circular cone. Depending on the angle between the plane and the cone, four different intersection shapes can be formed. </li>
<li>The types of conic sections are circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas.</li>
<li>Each conic section also has a degenerate form; these take the form of points and lines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>hyperbola</dt>
<dd>The conic section formed by the plane being perpendicular to the base of the cone.</dd>
<dt>ellipse</dt>
<dd>The conic section formed by the plane being at an angle to the base of the cone.</dd>

<dd>A dimensionless parameter characterizing the shape of a conic section.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Conic sections are a particular type of shape formed by the intersection of a plane and a right circular cone. Depending on the angle between the plane and the cone, four different intersection shapes can be formed. Each shape also has a degenerate form. There is a property of all conic sections called eccentricity, which takes the form of a numerical parameter <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. The four conic section shapes each have different values of <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. </p>



<a href='../images/1107.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1107.png' alt='Types of conic sections'></a>

<div><b><i>Types of conic sections</i></b></div>
<p>This figure shows how the conic sections, in light blue, are the result of a plane intersecting a cone. Image 1 shows a parabola, image 2 shows a circle (bottom) and an ellipse (top), and image 3 shows a hyperbola. Three double cones (two cones touching each other at their points, like an hourglass) with planes crossing through them. 1 has the plane perpendicuar to the edge of one cone, making a parabola. 2 has two planes crossing through it at angles less than the edge of the cone, making one closed ellipse and one circle when the plane is horizontal. 3 has a plane crossing through the cone vertically, making a hyperbola.</p>


<h3>Parabola</h3>

<p>A parabola is formed when the plane is parallel to the surface of the cone, resulting in a U-shaped curve that lies on the plane. Every parabola has certain features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vertex, which is the point at which the curve turns around</li>
<li>A focus, which is a point not on the curve about which the curve bends</li>
<li>An axis of symmetry, which is a line connecting the vertex and the focus which divides the parabola into two equal halves</li>
</ul>
<p>
All parabolas possess an eccentricity value <span class='clFormula'>$e=1$</span>
. As a direct result of having the same eccentricity, all parabolas are similar, meaning that any parabola can be transformed into any other with  a change of position and scaling. The degenerate case of a parabola is when the plane just barely touches the outside surface of the cone, meaning that it is tangent to the cone. This creates a straight line intersection out of the cone's diagonal.</p>
<p>Non-degenerate parabolas can be represented with quadratic functions such as</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$f(x) = x^2$</div>


<h3>Circle</h3>

<p>A circle is formed when the plane is parallel to the base of the cone. Its intersection with the cone is therefore a set of points equidistant from a common point (the central axis of the cone), which meets the definition of a circle. All circles have certain features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A center point</li>
<li>A radius, which the distance from any point on the circle to the center point</li>
</ul>
<p>All circles have an eccentricity <span class='clFormula'>$e=0$</span>
. Thus, like the parabola, all circles are similar and can be transformed into one another. On a coordinate plane, the general form of the equation of the circle is</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
 are the coordinates of the center of the circle, and <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
 is the radius.</p>
<p>The degenerate form of the circle occurs when the plane only intersects the very tip of the cone. This is a single point intersection, or equivalently a circle of zero radius.</p>



<a href='../images/1108.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1108.png' alt='Conic sections graphed by eccentricity'></a>

<div><b><i>Conic sections graphed by eccentricity</i></b></div>
<p>This graph shows an ellipse in red, with an example eccentricity value of <span class='clFormula'>$0.5$</span>
, a parabola in green with the required eccentricity of <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, and a hyperbola in blue with an example eccentricity of <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
. It also shows one of the degenerate hyperbola cases, the straight black line, corresponding to infinite eccentricity. The circle is on the inside of the parabola, which is on the inside of one side of the hyperbola, which has the horizontal line below it. In this way, increasing eccentricity can be identified with a kind of unfolding or opening up of the conic section.</p>


<h3>Ellipse</h3>

<p>When the plane's angle relative to the cone is between the outside surface of the cone and the base of the cone, the resulting intersection is an ellipse. The definition of an ellipse includes being parallel to the base of the cone as well, so all circles are a special case of the ellipse. Ellipses have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A major axis, which is the longest width across the ellipse</li>
<li>A minor axis, which is the shortest width across the ellipse</li>
<li>A center, which is the intersection of the two axes</li>
<li>Two focal points—for any point on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to both focal points is a constant</li>
</ul>
<p>Ellipses can have a range of eccentricity values: <span class='clFormula'>$0 \leq e &lt; 1$</span>
. Notice that the value <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
is included (a circle), but the value <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
is not included (that would be a parabola). Since there is a range of eccentricity values, not all ellipses are similar. The general form of the equation of an ellipse with major axis parallel to the x-axis is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&#10;}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
 are the coordinates of the center, <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
 is the length of the major axis, and <span class='clFormula'>$2b$</span>
 is the length of the minor axis. If the ellipse has a vertical major axis, the <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 labels will switch places.</p>
<p>The degenerate form of an ellipse is a point, or circle of zero radius, just as it was for the circle.</p>

<h3>Hyperbola</h3>

<p>A hyperbola is formed when the plane is parallel to the cone's central axis, meaning it intersects both parts of the double cone. Hyperbolas have two branches, as well as these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asymptote lines—these are two linear graphs that the curve of the hyperbola approaches, but never touches</li>
<li>A center, which is the intersection of the asymptotes</li>
<li>Two focal points, around which each of the two branches bend</li>
<li>Two vertices, one for each branch</li>
</ul>
<p>The general equation for a hyperbola with vertices on a horizontal line is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&#10;}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
 are the coordinates of the center. Unlike an ellipse, <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is not necessarily the larger axis number. It is the axis length connecting the two vertices.</p>
<p>The eccentricity of a hyperbola is restricted to <span class='clFormula'>$e &gt; 1$</span>
, and has no upper bound. If the eccentricity is allowed to go to the limit of <span class='clFormula'>$+\infty$</span>
(positive infinity), the hyperbola becomes one of its degenerate cases—a straight line. The other degenerate case for a hyperbola is to become its two straight-line asymptotes. This happens when the plane intersects the apex of the double cone.</p>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the parts of a parabola as parts of a conic section</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A parabola is formed by the intersection of a plane and a right circular cone.</li>
<li>All parabolas contain a focus, a directrix, and an axis of symmetry. These vary in exact location depending on the equation used to define the parabola.</li>
<li>Parabolas are frequently used in physics and engineering for things  such as the design of automobile headlight reflectors and the paths of ballistic missiles.</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

</dl>

<p>In mathematics, a parabola is a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to a generating straight line of that surface. In other words, the plane is at the same angle as the outside surface of the cone.</p>



<a href='../images/1109.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1109.png' alt='Parabolic conic section'></a>

<div><b><i>Parabolic conic section</i></b></div>
<p>This diagram shows how a parabola is generated by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cone. It also shows the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
axes that would be used to view the parabola on a coordinate graph. The vertex of the parabola here is point <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
, and the diagram shows the radius <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
between that point and the cone's central axis, as well as the angle <span class='clFormula'>$\theta$</span>
 between the parabola's axis of symmetry and the cone's central axis. </p>

<p>All parabolas have the same set of basic features.
The axis of symmetry is a line that is at the same angle as the cone and divides the parabola in half.</p>

<h3>
Vertex
</h3>

<p>The vertex is the point where the plane intersects the exterior surface of the cone. It forms the rounded end of the parabola. The vertex is therefore also a point on the cone, and the distance between that point and the cone's central axis is the radius of a circle.</p>

<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>In the diagram showing the parabolic conic section, a red line is drawn from the center of that circle to the axis of symmetry, so that a right angle is formed. The point on the axis of symmetry where the right angle is located is called the focus. By doing this, a right triangle is created.</p>



<a href='../images/1110.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1110.png' alt='Right triangle'></a>

<div><b><i>Right triangle</i></b></div>
<p>A right triangle is formed  from the focal point of the parabola.</p>

<p>The focal length is the leg of the right triangle that exists along the axis of symmetry, and the focal point is the vertex of the right triangle. Using the definition of sine as opposite over hypotenuse, we can find a formula for the focal length "<span class='clFormula'>$f$</span>
" in terms of the radius and the angle:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sin(\theta) &amp;= \frac{f}{r} \\&#10;f &amp;= r\sin(\theta)&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<h3>Directrix</h3>

<p>All parabolas have a directrix. The directrix is a straight line on the opposite side of the parabolic curve from the focus. The parabolic curve itself is the set of all points that are equidistant (equal distances) from both the directrix line and the focus.</p>

<h3>Features of Parabolas</h3>

<p>On a coordinate plane, parabolas are frequently encountered as graphs of quadratic functions, such as: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</div>

<p>Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction. Any parabola can be repositioned and rescaled to fit exactly on any other parabola—that is, all parabolas are similar.</p>
<p>To locate the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate of the vertex, cast the equation for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
in terms of <span class='clFormula'>$a x^2 + b x + c$</span>
. The vertex will be at the point:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{x= \frac{-b}{2a}}$</div>

<p>For example, in the parabola <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$a=1$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b=0$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$c=0$</span>
, and the vertex is at <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
.</p>
<p>Parabolas have the property that, if they are made of material that reflects light, then light which enters a parabola traveling parallel to its axis of symmetry is reflected to its focus. This happens regardless of where on the parabola the reflection occurs. Conversely, light that originates from a point source at the focus is reflected, or collimated, into a parallel beam. The light leaves the parabola parallel to the axis of symmetry. The same effect occurs with sound and other forms of energy. This reflective property is the basis of many practical uses of parabolas.</p>
<p>The parabola has many important applications, from the design of automobile headlight reflectors to calculating the paths of ballistic missiles. They are frequently used in physics, engineering, and other sciences.</p>

<p>A parabola is a conic section created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to a generating straight line of that surface. The parabola has many important applications, from the design of automobile headlight reflectors to calculating the paths of  ballistic missiles. They are frequently used in areas such as engineering and physics, and often appear in nature.</p>
<p>The parabolic trajectory of projectiles was discovered experimentally in the 17<sup>th</sup> century by Galileo, who performed experiments with balls rolling on inclined planes. What Galileo discovered and tested was that when gravity is the only force acting on an object, the distance it falls is directly proportional to the time squared. This is the exact mathematical relationship we know as a parabola.</p>
<p>For objects extended in space, such as a diver jumping from a diving board, the object follows a complex motion as it rotates, while its center of mass forms a parabola.</p>

<h3>Real World Parabolic Trajectories</h3>

<p>As in all cases in the physical world, using the equation of a parabola to model  a projectile's trajectory is an approximation. The presence of air resistance, for instance, distorts the parabolic shape. At higher speeds, such as in ballistics, the shape can be highly distorted. This is because air resistance is a force acting on the object, and is proportional to the object's area, density, and speed squared. For dense objects, and/or at low speeds, the air resistance force is small.
So, at low speeds the parabola shape can be a very good approximation.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Paraboloids  arise in many physical situations. All of the physical examples are situations where an object's trajectory or the shape of an object fits a generalized parabola function:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = ax^2 + bx + c$</div>

<p>The parameters <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
determine the direction as well as the exact shape and position of the parabola.</p>

<h3>Parabolic Reflectors</h3>

<p>One well-known example is the parabolic reflector—a mirror or similar reflective device that concentrates light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation to a common focal point. Conversely, a parabolic reflector can collimate light from a point source at the focus into a parallel beam. This principle was applied to telescopes in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Today, paraboloid reflectors are common throughout much of the world in microwave and satellite dish receiving and transmitting antennas.</p>

<h3>Liquid Paraboloids</h3>

<p>Paraboloids are also observed in the surface of a liquid confined to a container that is rotated around a central axis. In this case, liquid moves away from the center, and it  "climbs" the walls of the container, forming a parabolic surface. This is the principle behind the liquid mirror telescope.</p>

<h3>The "Vomit Comet"</h3>

<p>Aircraft used to create a weightless state for purposes of experimentation, such as NASA's "Vomit Comet," follow a vertically parabolic trajectory for brief periods. This allows them to trace the course of an object in free fall. This can produce the same effect as zero gravity, and lets the passengers on the aircraft experience the feeling of being in space.</p>

<blockquote>The equation for a circle is  an extension of the distance formula.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain how the equation of a circle describes its properties</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A circle is defined as the set of points that are a fixed distance from a center point.</li>
<li>The distance formula can be extended directly to the definition of a circle by noting that the radius is the distance between the center of a circle and the edge.</li>
<li>The general equation for a circle, centered at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(a,b\right)$</span>

such that <span class='clFormula'>$\left(x-a\right)^2+\left(y-b\right)^2=r^2$</span>
.</li>
<li>Pi (<span class='clFormula'>$\pi$</span>
) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>diameter</dt>
<dd>Two times the radius of a circle.</dd>
<dt>circle</dt>
<dd>A two-dimensional geometric figure, consisting of the set of all those points in a plane that are equally distant from another point.</dd>

<dt>area</dt>
<dd>The interior surface of a circle, given by <equation>$A = \pi r^2$</equation>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The definition of a circle is as simple as the shape. A circle is the set of all points that are at a certain distance from a center point. This definition is what gives us the concept of the radius of a circle, which is equal to that certain distance.</p>
<p>Since we know a circle is the set of points a fixed distance from a center point, let's look at how we can construct a circle in a Cartesian coordinate plane with variables <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. To find a formula for this, suppose that the center is the point <span class='clFormula'>$\left(a,b\right)$</span>
. According to the distance formula, the distance <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
from the point <span class='clFormula'>$\left(a,b\right)$</span>
to any other point <span class='clFormula'>$\left(x,y\right)$</span>
is:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{c = \sqrt{ \left(x-a\right)^2 + \left(y-b\right)^2}}&#10;$</span></p>
<p>If we now square this equation on both sides, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{c^{2} = \left(x-a\right)^{2}+\left(y-b\right)^{2}}$</div>

<p>Remember that the distance between the center <span class='clFormula'>$\left(a,b\right)$</span>
and any point <span class='clFormula'>$\left(x,y\right)$</span>
on the circle is that fixed distance, which is called the radius. So let's change this equation so that it uses <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
instead of <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
. </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r^{2} = \left(x-a\right)^{2}+\left(y-b\right)^{2}}$</div>

<p>This is the general formula for a circle with center <span class='clFormula'>$\left(a,b\right)$</span>
and radius <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
. Notice that all we have done is slightly rearrange the distance formula equation.</p>

<h3>Parts of a Circle</h3>

<p>Now that we have an algebraic foundation for the circle, let's connect it to what we already know about some different parts of the circle.</p>

<h3>Diameter</h3>

<p>The diameter is any straight line that passes through the center of the circle. It is equal to twice the radius, so:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$d = 2r$</div>


<h3>Circumference</h3>

<p>The circumference is the length of the path around the circle. Algebraically it is given by: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$c = 2\pi r$</span>
 </p>
<p>or equivalently by <span class='clFormula'>$c = \pi d$</span>
. The number <span class='clFormula'>$\pi$</span>
(pi) is defined by this relationship. It is the ratio of any circle's circumference to its own diameter.</p>

<h3>
Area
</h3>

<p>The area of a circle is given by: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$A = \pi r^2$</div>

<p> Notice that the radius is the only defining parameter for the size of any particular circle, and so it is the only variable that the area depends on.</p>

<h3 id='concept_413'>11.3.2. Introduction to Ellipses</h3>

<blockquote>Understand the equation of an ellipse as a stretched circle.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Connect the equation for an ellipse to the equation for a circle with stretching factors</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An ellipse and a circle are both examples of conic sections.</li>
<li>A circle is a special case of an ellipse, with the same radius for all points.</li>
<li>By stretching a circle in the x or y direction, an ellipse is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ellipse is one of the shapes called conic sections, which is formed by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cone. The general equation of an ellipse centered at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(h,k\right)$</span>
 is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{a^2} + \frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>when the major axis of the ellipse is horizontal.</p>



<a href='../images/1112.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1112.png' alt='Ellipse'></a>

<div><b><i>Ellipse</i></b></div>
<p>An ellipse is a conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cone.</p>

<p>In most definitions of the conic sections, the circle is defined as a special case of the ellipse, when the plane is parallel to the base of the cone. However, it is also possible to begin with the definition of a circle and use graphical transformations to arrive at the general formula for an ellipse.</p>
<p>Recall that a circle is defined as the set of all points equidistant from a common center. For simplicity, we will choose that center to be <span class='clFormula'>$\left(0,0\right)$</span>
, the origin of the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
plane. Then we can write the equation of the circle in this way:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$</div>

<p>In this equation,  <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
 is the radius of the circle. A circle has only one radius—the distance from the center to any point is the same. To change our circle into an ellipse, we will have to stretch or squeeze the circle so that the distances are no longer the same. First, let's start with a specific circle that's easy to work with, the circle centered at the origin with radius <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2 + y^2 = 1$</div>

<p>To make this into an ellipse, we must distort the circular shape so that it is no longer symmetric between <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. To do this, we introduce a scaling factor into one or both of the
<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates. Let's start by dividing all <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
coordinates by a factor <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, and therefore scaling the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
values. We simply substitute <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{x}{a}}$</span>
 into the equation instead of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. Important note: We assume that <span class='clFormula'>$a &gt; 1$</span>
.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + y^2 = 1}$</div>




<a href='../images/1113.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1113.png' alt='Ellipse along -axis'></a>

<div><b><i>Ellipse along <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>

<p>The ellipse <span class='clFormula'>$\left( \frac{x}{3} \right)^2 +y^2 = 1$</span>
 has been stretched along the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis by a factor of 3 as compared to the circle <span class='clFormula'>$x^2 + y^2 = 1$</span>
.</p>

<p>Every <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value that solved the old equation must now be multiplied by <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 in order to solve the new equation. This has the effect of stretching the ellipse further out on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, because larger values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
are now the solutions. </p>
<p>Similarly, we can scale all the values of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
by a factor <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 (we also assume <span class='clFormula'>$b &gt; 1$</span>
).</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle {x^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1}$</span></p>
<p>Now all the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
values are stretched vertically, further away from the origin. </p>



<a href='../images/1114.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1114.png' alt='Ellipse along -axis'></a>

<div><b><i>Ellipse along <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>

.</p>

<p>If we stretch in both the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 directions and distribute the powers of two through the parentheses, we get:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>which is exactly the equation of a horizontal ellipse centered at the origin. </p>
<p>If we had used scaling factors that were less than one, it would have compressed the shape instead of stretching it further out.</p>

<h3 id='concept_414'>11.3.3. Parts of an Ellipse</h3>

<blockquote>Ellipses are one of the types of conic sections. The specific features of an ellipse can be determined from its equation.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Discuss how the equation of an ellipse describes its properties</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An ellipse is formed by a plane intersecting a cone at an angle to its base.</li>
<li>All ellipses have two focal points, or foci. The sum of the distances from every point on the ellipse to the two foci is a constant.</li>
<li>All ellipses have a center and a major and minor axis.</li>
<li>All ellipses have eccentricity values greater than or equal to zero, and less than one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equation of an Ellipse</h3>

<p>An ellipse is a conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane with a right circular cone. The standard form for the equation of the ellipse is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{a^2} + \frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>if the ellipse is oriented horizontally, and:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{a^2} + \frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>if the ellipse is oriented vertically. We will use the horizontal case to demonstrate how to determine the properties of an ellipse from its equation, so that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is associated with x-coordinates, and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 with y-coordinates. For a vertical ellipse, the association is reversed.</p>



<a href='../images/1115.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1115.png' alt='Diagram of an ellipse'></a>

<div><b><i>Diagram of an ellipse</i></b></div>
<p>This diagram of a horizontal ellipse shows the ellipse itself in red, the center <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
at the origin, the focal points at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(+f,0\right)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\left(-f,0\right)$</span>
, the major axis vertices at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(+a,0\right)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\left(-a,0\right)$</span>
, the minor axis vertices at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(0,+b\right)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\left(0,-b\right)$</span>
. It also shows how the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is a constant at <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
(the length of the major axis), and how the eccentricity is determined by the ratio of the distance from a point on the ellipse to one of the foci to the perpendicular distance from the point to a line <span class='clFormula'>$D$</span>
called the directrix, outside the ellipse and perpendicular to the major axis.</p>


<h3>Parts of an Ellipse</h3>

<h3>Center</h3>

<p>The center of the ellipse has coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Major Axis</h3>

<p>The major axis of the ellipse is the longest width across it. For a horizontal ellipse, that axis is parallel to the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. The major axis has length <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
. Its endpoints are the major axis vertices, with coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h \pm a, k)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Minor Axis</h3>

<p>The minor axis of the ellipse is the shortest width across it. For a horizontal ellipse, it is parallel to the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis. The minor axis has length <span class='clFormula'>$2b$</span>
. Its endpoints are the minor axis vertices, with coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h, k \pm b)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Foci</h3>

<p>The foci are two points inside the ellipse that characterize its shape and curvature. For a horizontal ellipse, the foci have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h \pm c,k)$</span>
, where the focal length <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
 is given by</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$c^2 = a^2 - b^2$</div>


<h3>Eccentricity</h3>

<p>All conic sections have an eccentricity value, denoted <span class='clFormula'>$e$</span>
. All ellipses have eccentricities in the range <span class='clFormula'>$0 \leq e &lt; 1$</span>
. An eccentricity of zero is the special case where the ellipse becomes a circle. An eccentricity of <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
is a parabola, not an ellipse.</p>
<p>The eccentricity is defined as:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{e = \frac{c}{a}}$</div>

<p>or, equivalently:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;e &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a} \\ &#10;&amp;= \sqrt{ \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}  } \\&#10;&amp;= \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>The orbits of the planets and their moons are ellipses with very low eccentricities, which is to say they are nearly circular. The orbits of comets around the sun can be much more eccentric. For comets and planets, the sun is located at one focus of their elliptical orbits.</p>

</dl>

<p>Circles are all around you in everyday life, from tires on cars to buttons on coats, as well as on the tops of bowls, glasses, and water bottles. Ellipses are less common. One example is  the orbits of planets, but you should be able to find the area of a circle or an ellipse, or the circumference of a circle, based on information given to you in a problem. Circles and ellipses are examples of conic sections, which are curves formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone.</p>
<p>Some sample problems are shown below, with solutions worked out.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>Let's say you are a gardener, and you have just planted a lot of flowers that you want to water. The flower bed is 15 feet wide, and 15 feet long. You are using a circular sprinkler system, and the water reaches 6 feet out from the center. The sprinkler is located, from the bottom left corner of the bed, 7 feet up, and 6 feet over.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the flower bed was a graph with the bottom left corner being the origin, what would the equation of the circle be?</li>
<li>What is the area being watered by the sprinkler?</li>
<li>What percentage of the garden that is being watered?</li>
</ol>



<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>If the bottom left corner is the origin, it has coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$\left(0,0\right)$</span>
. From there the sprinkler is 6 feet over, so the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate of the center is 6. The sprinkler is 7 feet up, so the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate of the center is 7. Ergo, the center of the circle is at coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$\left(6,7\right)$</span>
. The water reaches 6 feet out from the sprinkler, so the circle radius is 6 feet. Therefore the equation of this circle is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\left(x-6\right)^2+\left(y-7\right)^2=36}$</div>

<p>The area that is watered by the sprinkler can be labeled <span class='clFormula'>$A_{sprinkler}$</span>
, and is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;A_{sprinkler} &amp;=\pi\cdot r^2\\ &#10;&amp;=\pi\cdot 6^2\\ &#10;&amp;=36\pi&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>The first step to finding the percentage of the garden that is being watered is to check that none of the water is falling outside the garden. The sprinkler is at coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$\left(6,7\right)$</span>
, and the radius of the sprinkler is 6 feet. You can test that the water does not fall outside the <span class='clFormula'>$15\times 15$</span>
garden. </p>
<p>Once we know that the area that is watered is completely inside the garden, the percentage of the garden that is watered can be found by dividing the area watered by the total area of the garden, and then multiplying by <span class='clFormula'>$100\%$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;Percentage_{watered} &amp;=\frac {A_{sprinkler}}{A_{flower bed}}\cdot 100\%\\ &#10;&amp;=\frac {36\pi}{15^2}\cdot 100\%\\&#10;&amp;=\frac {113.1}{225}\cdot 100\%\\ &#10;&amp;=50.3\%&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>




<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Now, let's take it the other way. <span class='clFormula'>$(x - 4)^2+(y+8)^2=49$</span>
is the equation for a circle.</p>

<ol>
<li>What are the coordinates of the center of the circle?</li>
<li>What is the radius?</li>
<li>Draw the circle. </li>
<li>Find two points on the circle and plug them into the equation to make sure your drawing is correct. </li>
</ol>





<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>The center of the circle can be found by comparing the equation in this exercise to the  equation of a circle:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2=r^2$</div>

<p> The center of the circle is at coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$\left(h,k\right)$</span>
, and so the center of the circle in this exercise is at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(4,-8\right)$</span>
.</p>
<p>The radius of the circle is <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
. From the equation of a circle, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r^2=49}$</span>
. Therefore: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;r^2 &amp;= 49 \\&#10;r &amp;= \sqrt{49} \\&#10;&amp;= 7&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<div><b><i>Exercise 2 circle</i></b></div>
<p>Graph of the circle <span class='clFormula'>$(x - 4)^2+(y+8)^2=49$</span>
.</p>

<p>There are many points you could choose. For example, the point <span class='clFormula'>$\left(4, -1\right)$</span>
is at the top of the circle. Plugging this into the equation, we get:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2 &amp;=r^2 \\&#10;(4-4)^2+(-1+8)^2 &amp;= 49 \\&#10;(0)^2 + (7)^2 &amp;= 49 \\&#10;49 &amp;= 49&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span></p>
<p>The left side is equal to the right side of the equation, and so  this is a valid point on the circle. </p>
<p> The leftmost point on the circle is <span class='clFormula'>$(-3,-8)$</span>
. Plugging this in to the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2 &amp;=r^2 \\&#10;\left(-3-4\right)^2+\left(-8+8\right)^2 &amp;= 49 \\&#10;(-7)^2 + (0)^2 &amp;= 49 \\&#10;49 &amp;= 49&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>
The left side is equal to the right side of the equation, and so  this is a valid point on the circle.</p>



<h3>Exercise 3</h3>


<ol>
<li>Put <span class='clFormula'>$2x^2+2y^2+8x+24y+60=0$</span>
 into the standard circle form:         <span class='clFormula'>$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$</span>
.</li>
<li>What is the center and the radius of the circle?</li>
<li>Draw the circle.</li>
<li>
Find two points on the circle and plug them into the equation to make sure your drawing is correct.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>First, divide the equation by the coefficient of <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y^2$</span>
, which is <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;2x^2+2y^2+8x+24y+60 &amp;=0 \\&#10;\frac{2x^2+2y^2+8x+24y+60}{2} &amp;=\frac{0}{2} \\&#10;\frac{2x^2}{2}+\frac{2y^2}{2}+\frac{8x}{2}+\frac{24y}{2}+\frac{60}{2} &amp;=\frac{0}{2} \\&#10;x^2+y^2+4x+12y+30 &amp;=0&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span></p>
<p>Next, collect <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
terms together, and bring the number to the right side of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(x^2+4x)+(y^2+12y)=-30$</div>

<p>Now, complete the square in both parentheses, subtracting or adding the necessary constant to both sides of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;(x^2+4x+4)+(y^2+12y+36) &amp;=-30+4+36 \\&#10;(x^2+4x+4)+(y^2+12y+36) &amp;= 10&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Notice that each term is a perfect square, which gives: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(x+2)^2+(y+6)^2=10$</div>

<p>This is now in the standard form for the equation of a circle.</p>


<p>The center of the circle is at coordinate <span class='clFormula'>$\left(h,k\right)$</span>
, and so the center of the circle in this exercise is at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(-2,-6\right)$</span>
.</p>
<p>The radius of the circle is <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
. From the equation of a circle, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{r^2=10}$</span>
. Therefore: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;r^2 &amp;= 10 \\&#10;r &amp;= \sqrt{10}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>It is fine to leave the value of <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
in this form.</p>

<p>There are many points you could choose. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(-5,-5)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(-3, -9)$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;(-5+2)^2 + (-5 + 6)^2 &amp;= 10 \\&#10;(-3)^2 + (1)^2 &amp;= 10 \\&#10;9 + 1 &amp;=10\\&#10;10 &amp;= 10&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;(-3+2)^2 + (-9+6)^2 &amp;= 10\\&#10;(-1)^2 + (-3)^2 &amp;= 10 \\&#10;1 + 9 &amp;= 10 \\&#10;10 &amp;= 10&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>



<p>Both are valid points on the circle.</p>

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>


<ol>
<li>Put the equation <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{ &#10;\frac{4x^2}{9} + 25y^2 = 1 }$</span>
into standard form.</li>
<li>
What is the center?</li>
<li>How long is the major axis?</li>
<li>How long is the minor axis?</li>
<li>Graph it.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>This almost looks like an ellipse in standard form, doesn't it? It even has a number on the right side. But it isn't. There is no room in the standard form for the values <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$25$</span>
in the numerators. How can we get rid of them to get into standard form?</p>
<p>Rewrite the left-hand term, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{4x^2}{9}}$</span>
, by dividing the top and bottom of the fraction by <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
. Leave the bottom as a fraction; don't make it a decimal.</p>
<p>Rewrite the right-hand term, <span class='clFormula'>$25y^2$</span>
, as <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{25y^2}{1}}$</span>
, and divide the top and bottom of the fraction by <span class='clFormula'>$25$</span>
. Leave the bottom as a fraction; don't make it a decimal.</p>
<p>The equation is now:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{ &#10;\begin{align}&#10;\frac{4x^2}{9} + 25y^2 &amp;= 1 \\&#10;\frac{\frac{4x^2}{4}}{\frac{9}{4}} + \frac{\frac{25y^2}{25}}{\frac{1}{25}} &amp;= 1 \\&#10;\frac{x^2}{\frac{9}{4}} + \frac{y^2}{\frac{1}{25}} &amp;= 1&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>From the standard equation, <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac {\left(x-h\right)^2}{a^2}+\frac {\left(y-k\right)^2}{b^2}= 1}$</span>
, we know that the center is at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(h,k\right)$</span>
. Since these are both zero in this equation, the center is at <span class='clFormula'>$\left(0,0\right)$</span>
.</p>
<p>The major axis depends which is longer, <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. Let's solve for both, and find out which is larger afterward.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;a^2 &amp;= \frac{9}{4} \\&#10;a &amp;= \frac{3}{2} \\&#10;2a &amp;= \frac{6}{2} \\&#10;&amp;= 3&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;b^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{25} \\&#10;b &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \\&#10;2b &amp;= \frac{2}{5}&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Since <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{3&gt;\frac{2}{5}}$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$2a&gt;2b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
is the major axis. The major axis length is <span class='clFormula'>$2a = 3$</span>
, and the minor axis length is <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{2b = \frac{2}{5}}$</span>
. </p>

<h2 id='section_51'>11.4. The Hyperbola</h2>

<h3 id='concept_415'>11.4.1. Introduction to Hyperbolas</h3>

<blockquote>Hyperbolas are one of the four conic sections, and are described by certain kinds of equations.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Connect the equation for a hyperbola to the shape of its graph</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A hyperbola is formed by the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the bases of a double cone.</li>
<li>All hyperbolas have an eccentricity value greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
.</li>
<li>All hyperbolas have two branches, each with a vertex and a focal point.</li>
<li>All hyperbolas have asymptotes, which are straight lines that form an X that the hyperbola approaches but never touches.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dd>One of the conic sections.</dd>
<dt>ellipse</dt>
<dd>One of the conic sections.</dd>

<dd>A turning point in a curved function. Every hyperbola has two vertices.</dd>
<dt>focal point</dt>
<dd>A point not on a hyperbola, around which the hyperbola curves.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A hyperbola can be defined in a number of ways. A hyperbola is: </p>

<ol>
<li>The intersection of a right circular double cone with a plane at an angle greater than the slope of the cone (for example, perpendicular to the base of the cone)</li>
<li>The set of all points such that the difference between the distances to two focal points is constant</li>
<li>The set of all points such that the ratio of the distance to a single focal point divided by the distance to a line (the directrix) is greater than one</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see how that second definition gives us what is called the standard form of a hyperbola equation.</p>



<a href='../images/1119.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1119.png' alt='Diagram of a hyperbola'></a>

<div><b><i>Diagram of a hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>
The hyperbola, shown in blue, has a center at the origin, two focal points at <span class='clFormula'>$(-c,0)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(c,0)$</span>
, and two vertices located at <span class='clFormula'>$+a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-a$</span>
on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. A hyperbola consists of two roughly U-shaped (but not parabolic) curves with oblique asymptotes. In this example, the two curves open to the left and to the right, and are symmetric over the x-axis. The foci are inside the U-shaped curves. (To the left of the left curve's vertex, and to the right of the right curve's vertex.)

<p>We begin with two focal points, <span class='clFormula'>$F_1$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$F_2$</span>
, located on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, so that they have coordinates
<span class='clFormula'>$(c,0)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(-c,0)$</span>
 (other arrangements are possible). We want the set of all points that have the same <em>difference</em> between the distances to these points. The center of this hyperbola is the origin <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
.</p>
<p>Imagine that we take a point on the red hyperbola curve, called <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
, and we let that point be the <span class='clFormula'>$+a$</span>
value on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. Then the difference of distances between <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
 and the two focal points is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;(P \rightarrow F_2) - (P \rightarrow F_1) &amp;= (c+a) - (c - a)\\ &#10;&amp;= 2a&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is the distance from the center (origin) to the vertices of the hyperbola. With this value for the difference of distances, we can choose any point <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
 on the hyperbola and construct an equation by use of the distance formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + (y-0)^2} - \sqrt{ (x - (-c))^2 + (y-0)^2 } &amp;= 2a \\&#10;\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2} - \sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} &amp;= 2a&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>From here there is some straightforward, but messy, algebra. We need to square both sides of this equation multiple times if we want the variables to escape their square roots. When the dust settles, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2(c^2 - a^2) - a^2y^2 = a^2(c^2 - a^2)$</div>

<p>At this point we introduce one more parameter, defined as <span class='clFormula'>$b^2 = c^2 - a^2$</span>
, which reduces the hyperbola even further:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$b^2x^2 - a^2y^2 = a^2b^2$</div>

<p>Lastly we divide both sides of the equation by <span class='clFormula'>$a^2b^2$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;b^2x^2 - a^2y^2 &amp;= a^2b^2 \\&#10;\frac{b^2x^2}{a^2 b^2} - \frac{a^2y^2}{a^2 b^2} &amp;= \frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2 b^2} \\&#10;\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} &amp;= 1&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Thus, the standard form of the equation for a hyperbola with focal points on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
axis is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>If the focal points are on the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, the variables simply change places:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>Note that the hyperbola standard form is very similar to the standard form of the ellipse:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>The similarity is not coincidental. The ellipse can be defined as all points that have a constant sum of distances to two focal points, and the hyperbola is defined as all points that have constant <em>difference</em> of distances to two focal points.</p>
<p>There is another common form of hyperbola equation that, at first glance, looks very different: <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{y = \frac{1}{x}}$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$xy = 1$</span>
.</p>



<a href='../images/1120.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1120.png' alt='Reciprocal hyperbola'></a>

<div><b><i>Reciprocal hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>This hyperbola is defined by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$xy = 1$</span>
. Two curves in the third and first quadrants. Both have the x and y axes as asymptotes, and both are decreasing.</p>

<p>From the graph, it can be seen that the hyperbola formed by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$xy = 1$</span>
is the same shape as the standard form hyperbola, but rotated by <span class='clFormula'>$45^\circ$</span>
. To prove that it is the same as the standard hyperbola, you can check for yourself that it has two focal points and that all points have the same difference of distances. Another way to prove it algebraically is to construct a rotated <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinate frame.</p>

<h3 id='concept_416'>11.4.2. Parts of a Hyperbola</h3>

<blockquote>The  features of a hyperbola can be determined from its equation.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the parts of a hyperbola and the expressions for each</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Hyperbolas are conic sections, formed by the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the bases of a double cone.</li>
<li>Hyperbolas can also be understood as the locus of all points with a common difference of distances to two focal points.</li>
<li>All hyperbolas have two branches, each with a focal point and a vertex.</li>
<li>Hyperbolas are related to inverse functions, of the family <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{y=\frac{1}{x}}$</span>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>A hyperbola is one of the four conic sections. All hyperbolas share common features, and it is possible to determine the specifics of any hyperbola from the equation that defines it.</p>

<h3>Standard Form</h3>




<a href='../images/1121.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1121.png' alt='Diagram of a hyperbola'></a>

<div><b><i>Diagram of a hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>All hyperbolas share common features. A hyperbola consists of two curves, each with a vertex and a focus. The transverse axis is the axis that crosses through both vertices and foci, and the conjugate axis is perpendicular to it. A hyperbola also has asymptotes which cross in an "x". The two branches of the hyperbola are on opposite sides of the asymptotes' cross. The vertices and asymptotes can be used to form a rectangle, with the vertices at the centers of two opposite sides and the corners on the asymptotes. The centers of the other two sides, along the conjugate axis, are called the co-vertices. Where the asymptotes of the hyperbola cross is called the center. A hyperbola has two roughly U-shaped (but not parabolic) curves which lie on opposite sides of two crosses asymptotes. They have foci that lie inside the vertices. The hyperbola shown has its transverse axis, which is its axis of symmetry, along the x-axis.</p>

<p>If the foci lie on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, the standard form of a hyperbola is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>If the foci lie on the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, the standard form is: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1}$</div>

<p>We will use the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis hyperbola to demonstrate how to determine the features of a hyperbola, so that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 is associated with <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinates and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
 is associated with <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinates. For a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis hyperbola, the associations are reversed.</p>

<h3>Center</h3>

<p>The center has coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Vertices</h3>

<p>The vertices have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h + a,k)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h-a,k)$</span>
. The line connecting the vertices is called the transverse axis.</p>

<h3>Co-Vertices</h3>

<p>The co-vertices correspond to <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, the "minor semi-axis length", and have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k+b)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k-b)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>
Asymptotes
</h3>

<p>The major and minor axes <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, as the vertices and co-vertices, describe a rectangle that shares the same center as the hyperbola, and has dimensions <span class='clFormula'>$2a \times 2b$</span>
. The asymptotes of the hyperbola are straight lines that are the diagonals of this rectangle. We can therefore use the corners of the rectangle to define the equation of these lines:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{y = \pm \frac{a}{b}(x - h) + k}$</div>

<p>The rectangle itself is also useful for drawing the hyperbola graph by hand, as it contains the vertices. When drawing the hyperbola, draw the rectangle first. Then draw in the asymptotes as extended lines that are also the diagonals of the rectangle. Finally, draw the curve of the hyperbola by following the asymptote inwards, curving in to touch the vertex on the rectangle, and then following the other asymptote out. Repeat for the other branch.</p>

<h3>Focal Points</h3>

<p>The foci have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h+c, k)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h-c,k)$</span>
. The value of <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is found with this relation: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$</div>


<h3>Rectangular Hyperbola</h3>

<p>Rectangular hyperbolas, defined by </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left(x-h\right)\left(y-k\right) = m$</div>

<p>for some constant <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
, are much simpler to analyze than standard form hyperbolas.</p>



<a href='../images/1122.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1122.png' alt='Rectangular hyperbola'></a>

<div><b><i>Rectangular hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>This rectangular hyperbola has its center at the origin, and is also the graph of the function <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{f(x) = \frac{1}{x}}$</span>
. A hyperbola with asymptotes of the x- and y-axes, and branches in quadrants three and one. It is always decreasing.</p>

<h3>Center</h3>

<p>The center of a rectangular hyperbola has coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h,k)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Vertices and Co-Vertices</h3>

<p>The rectangular hyperbola is highly symmetric. Both its major and minor axis values are equal, so that <span class='clFormula'>$a = b = \sqrt{2m}$</span>
. The vertices have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h+\sqrt{2m},k+\sqrt{2m})$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h-\sqrt{2m},k-\sqrt{2m})$</span>
.</p>
<p>The co-vertices have coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(h-\sqrt{2m},k+\sqrt{2m})$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h+\sqrt{2m},k-\sqrt{2m})$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Asymptotes</h3>

<p>The asymptotes of a rectangular hyperbola are the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
- and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axes.</p>

<h3>Focal Points</h3>

<p>We can use <span class='clFormula'>$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$</span>
 as before. With <span class='clFormula'>$a = b = \sqrt{2m}$</span>
, we find that <span class='clFormula'>$c = \pm 2\sqrt{m}$</span>
. Therefore the focal points are located at <span class='clFormula'>$(h+2\sqrt{m},k+2\sqrt{m})$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(h-2\sqrt{m},k-2\sqrt{m})$</span>
.</p>

<dd>Any of the four distinct shapes that are the intersections of a cone with a plane, namely the circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Example</h5>

<ul>
<li>A hyperbola is the basis for solving trilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from GPS transmitters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications and Problem Solving</h3>

<p>As we should know by now, a hyperbola is an open curve with two branches, the intersection of a plane with both halves of a double cone. The plane may or may not be parallel to the axis of the cone. </p>

<div><b><i>Hyperbola</i></b></div>
<p>A hyperbola is an open curve with two branches, the intersection of a plane with both halves of a double cone. The plane may or may not be parallel to the axis of the cone.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of hyperbolas in the real world.</p>

<h3>Sundials</h3>

<p>Hyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. Every day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. The angle between the ground plane and the sunlight cone depends on where you are and the axial tilt of Earth, which changes seasonally. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola.</p>
<p>Sundials work by casting the shadow of a vertical marker, sometimes called a gnomon, over a clock face on the horizontal surface. The angle between the sunlight and the ground will be the same as the angle formed by the line connecting the tip of the gnomon with the end of its shadow.</p>
<p>If we mark where the end of the shadow falls over the course of the day, the line traced out by the shadow forms a hyperbola on the ground (this path is called the <em>declination line</em>). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the angle of the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. </p>
<p>The parameters of the traced hyperbola, such as its asymptotes and its eccentricity, are related to the specific physical conditions that produced it, namely the angle between the sunlight and the ground, and the latitude at which the sundial exists.</p>


<h3>Trilateration</h3>

<p>Trilateration is the a method of pinpointing an exact location, using its distances to a given points. The can also be characterized as the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the desired point and known points. These types of problems arise in navigation, mainly nautical. A ship can locate its position using the arrival times of signals from GPS transmitters. Alternatively, a homing beacon can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations. This can be used to track people, cell phones, internet signals, and many other things. </p>
<p>In the case in which a ship, or other object to be located, only knows the difference in distances between itself and two known points, the curve of possible locations is a hyperbola. One way of defining a hyperbola is as precisely this: the curve of points such that the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two focal points remains constant.</p>
<p>So if we call this difference in distances <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
, the hyperbola will have vertices separated by the same distance <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
, and the foci of the hyperbola will be the two known points.</p>

<h3>The Kepler Orbit of Particles</h3>

<p>The Kepler orbit is the path followed by any orbiting body. This can be applied to a particle of any size, as long as gravity is the only force causing the orbital trajectory. Depending on the orbital properties, including size and shape (eccentricity), this orbit can be any of the four conic sections. In particular, if the eccentricity e<em> </em>of the orbit is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
, the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. In the figure, the blue line shows the hyperbolic Kepler orbit. In the common case of a gravitational orbit, the massive object is one of the foci of the hyperbola (or other conic section).</p>



<a href='../images/1124.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1124.png' alt='Kepler orbits'></a>

<div><b><i>Kepler orbits</i></b></div>
<p>A diagram of the various forms of the Kepler Orbit and their eccentricities. Blue is a hyperbolic trajectory (<span class='clFormula'>$e &gt; 1$</span>
). Green is a parabolic trajectory (<span class='clFormula'>$e = 1$</span>
). Red is an elliptical orbit (<span class='clFormula'>$e &lt; 1$</span>
). Grey is a circular orbit (<span class='clFormula'>$e = 0$</span>
).</p>

<p>Physically, another way to understand hyperbolic orbits is in terms of the energy of the orbiting particle. Orbits which are circular or elliptical are bound orbits, which is to say the object never escapes its closed path around one of the focal points. This is associated with the particle's total energy <span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
being less than the minimum energy required to escape, and so <span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
is said to be negative in these cases. </p>
<p>A parabolic trajectory does have the particle escaping the system. However, this is the very special case when the total energy <span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
is exactly the minimum escape energy, so <span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
in this case is considered to be zero.</p>
<p>If there is any additional energy on top of the minimum (zero) value, the trajectory will become hyperbolic, and so <span class='clFormula'>$E$</span>
is positive in the hyperbolic orbit case. </p>

<h3 id='concept_221'>11.5.1. Nonlinear Systems of Equations and Problem-Solving</h3>

<blockquote>As with linear systems, a nonlinear system of equations (and conics) can be solved graphically and algebraically for all of its variables.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve nonlinear systems of equations graphically and algebraically</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Subtracting one equation from another is an effective means for solving linear systems, but it often is difficult to use in nonlinear systems, in which the terms of two equations may be very different.</li>
<li>Substitution of a variable into another equation is usually the best method for solving nonlinear systems of equations.</li>
<li>Nonlinear systems of equations may have one or multiple solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>system of equations</dt>
<dd>A set of formulas with multiple variables which can be solved using a specific set of values.</dd>
<dt>conic section</dt>
<dd>Any of the four distinct shapes that are the intersections of a cone with a plane, namely the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.</dd>
<dt>nonlinear</dt>
<dd>An algebraic term that is raised to the power of two or higher; equivalently, a function with a curved graph.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Conic Sections</h3>

<p>A conic section (or just conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of a cone (more precisely, a right circular conical surface) with a plane. In analytic geometry, a conic may be defined as a plane algebraic curve of degree 2. There are a number of other geometric definitions possible. The four types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, the ellipse, and the circle, though the circle can be considered to be a special case of the ellipse. </p>
<p>The type of a conic corresponds to its eccentricity. Conics with eccentricity less than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
are ellipses, conics with eccentricity equal to <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
are parabolas, and conics with eccentricity greater than <span class='clFormula'>$1$</span>
are hyperbolas. In the focus-directrix definition of a conic, the circle is a limiting case of the ellipse with an eccentricity of <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. In modern geometry, certain degenerate cases, such as the union of two lines, are included as conics as well.</p>

<h3>System of Equations</h3>

<p>In a system of equations, two or more relationships are stated among variables. A system is solvable as long as there are as many simultaneous equations as variables. If each equation is graphed, the solution for the system can be found at the point where all the functions meet. The solution can be found either by inspection of a graph, typically by using graphing or plotting software, or algebraically.</p>

<h3>Nonlinear Systems</h3>

<p>Nonlinear systems of equations, such as conic sections, include at least one equation that is nonlinear. A nonlinear equation is defined as an equation possessing at least one term that is raised to a power of 2 or more. When graphed, these equations produce curved lines.</p>
<p>Since at least one function has curvature, it is possible for nonlinear systems of equations to contain multiple solutions. As with linear systems of equations, substitution can be used to solve nonlinear systems for one variable and then the other.</p>
<p>Solving nonlinear systems of equations algebraically is similar to doing the same for linear systems of equations. However, subtraction of one equation from another can become impractical if the two equations have different terms, which is more commonly the case in nonlinear systems.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider, for example, the following system of equations:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;y &amp;= x^2 \; \qquad (1) \\&#10;y &amp;= x + 6 \quad (2)&#10;\end{align}$</div>




<a href='../images/1125.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1125.png' alt='Integer values of   (blue) and   (red)'></a>

<div><b><i>Integer values of  <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
(blue) and <span class='clFormula'>$y=x+6$</span>
(red)</i></b></div>
<p>The parabola (blue) falls below the line (red) between <span class='clFormula'>$x=-2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
. For all values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
less than <span class='clFormula'>$-2$</span>
and greater than <span class='clFormula'>$3$</span>
, points on the parabola are above the line.</p>

<p>We can solve this system algebraically by using equation  <span class='clFormula'>$(1)$</span>
as a substitution. The quantity <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
 must be equivalent to the quantity <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, so we substitute <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
in equation <span class='clFormula'>$(2)$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=x+6 \\&#10;x^2&amp;=x+6&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>This quadratic equation can be solved by moving all the equation's components to the left before using the quadratic formula:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2-x-6=0$</div>

<p>Using the quadratic formula, with <span class='clFormula'>$a = 1$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b = -2$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c = -6$</span>
, it can be determined that the solutions are <span class='clFormula'>$x = -2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x = 3$</span>
.</p>
<p>The solutions for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
can then be plugged into either of the original systems to find the value of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. In this example, we will use equation <span class='clFormula'>$(1)$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=x^2 \\&#10;y&amp;=(-2)^2 \\&#10;y&amp;=4&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=x^2 \\&#10;y&amp;=(3)^2\\&#10;y&amp;=9&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</div>

<p>Thus, for <span class='clFormula'>$x = -2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$y = 4$</span>
, and for <span class='clFormula'>$x = 3$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$y = 9$</span>
.</p>
<p>Our final solutions are: <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,4)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(3,9)$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_222'>11.5.2. Models Involving Nonlinear Systems of Equations</h3>

<blockquote>Nonlinear systems of equations can be used to solve complex problems involving multiple known relationships.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use nonlinear systems of equations to solve problems in the real world</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Problems involving simultaneously moving bodies can be solved using systems of equations. If at least one body accelerates or decelerates, the system is nonlinear.</li>
<li>If the relationship between multiple unknown numbers is described in as many ways as there are numbers, all unknowns can be found using systems of equations. If at least one of those relationships is nonlinear, the system is nonlinear.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dt>system of equations</dt>
<dd>A set of formulas with multiple variables which can be solved using a specific set of values.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Nonlinear systems of equations are not just for hypothetical discussions—they can be used to solve complex problems involving multiple known relationships.</p>

<h3>Real World Examples</h3>

<p>Consider, for example, a car that begins at rest and accelerates at a constant rate of <span class='clFormula'>$4$</span>
meters per second each second. Its position in meters (<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
) can be determined as a function of time in seconds (<span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
), by the formula:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle{&#10;\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(4\right)t^2\\&#10;y&amp;=2t^2&#10;\end{align}&#10;}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Now consider a second car, traveling at a constant speed of <span class='clFormula'>$20$</span>
meters per second. Its position (<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
) in meters can be determined as a function of time (<span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
) in seconds, using the following formula:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$y=20t$</span>
 </p>
<p>When the first car begins to accelerate, the second car is  <span class='clFormula'>$400$</span>
meters ahead of it. To express the position of the second car relative to the first as a function of time, we can modify the second equation as such:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$y=20t+400$</span>
 </p>
<p>To determine where the cars are when they are alongside one another and how much time has passed since the first began to accelerate, we can algebraically solve the system of equations using substitution:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;y&amp;=20t+400\\&#10;2t^2&amp;=20t+400&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Solving for <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
, we can find that the cars are side-by-side after <span class='clFormula'>$20$</span>
seconds.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class='clFormula'>$20$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$t$</span>
into the equations for either of the cars, we can find that the cars meet <span class='clFormula'>$800$</span>
meters ahead of the first car's starting point. Note that a question on an exam may not prompt solutions for both variables.</p>
<p> Some other real-world examples of nonlinear systems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triangulation of GPS signals. A device like your cellphone receives signals from GPS satellites, which have known orbital positions around the Earth. A signal from a single satellite allows a cellphone to know that it is somewhere on a circle. Additional signals are additional circles that intersect each other, and the cellphone's actual position is at the intersection. Three or more signals reduce the solution of the system to a single coordinate point.</li>
<li>The conservation of mechanical energy can produce a system of nonlinear equations when there is an elastic (perfectly bouncy) collision. The kinetic energy of the objects depends on the speed squared, and the momentum depends on the speed directly.</li>
<li> Manufacturing and design of everything, from electronic parts to metal tools to the architecture of buildings, uses computer-aided design software that helps create three-dimensional shapes from the intersection of curved lines. Rendering and visualizing these objects, and formulating a plan for constructing them, requires the software to solve nonlinear systems. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Example</h3>

<p>In addition to practical scenarios like the above, nonlinear systems can be used in abstract problems. For example, a question on an exam could ask:</p>
<p>The product of two numbers is 12, and the sum of their squares is 40. What are the numbers?</p>
<p>In this case, we could make an equation for each known relationship:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$\begin{align}&#10;x\cdot y&amp;=12 \\&#10;x^2+y^2&amp;=40&#10;\end{align}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Substitution can be used to calculate that the numbers are 2 and 6.</p>

<h3 id='concept_223'>11.5.3. Nonlinear Systems of Inequalities</h3>

<blockquote>Systems of nonlinear inequalities can be solved by graphing boundary lines.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice techniques for solving nonlinear systems of inequalities</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A nonlinear system of inequalities may have at least one solution; if it does, a solution may be bounded or unbounded.</li>
<li>A solution for a nonlinear system of inequalities will be in a region that satisfies every inequality in the system.</li>
<li>The best way to show solutions to nonlinear systems of inequalities is graphically, by shading the area that satisfies all of the system's constituent inequalities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>inequality</dt>
<dd>A statement that, of two quantities, one is specifically less than or greater than another. Symbols: <equation>$&lt;$</equation> or <equation>$\leq$</equation> or <equation>$&gt;$</equation> or <equation>$\geq$</equation>, as appropriate.</dd>
<dt>nonlinear</dt>
<dd>A polynomial expression of degree 2 or higher.</dd>
<dt>system of equations</dt>
<dd>A set of formulas with multiple variables which can be solved using a specific set of values.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A system of inequalities consists of two or more inequalities, which are statements that one quantity is greater than or less than another. A nonlinear inequality is an inequality that involves a nonlinear expression—a polynomial function of degree 2 or higher. The most common way of solving one inequality with two variables <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
is to shade the region  on a graph where the inequality is satisfied. </p>



<a href='../images/1126.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1126.png' alt='Cubic function'></a>

<div><b><i>Cubic function</i></b></div>
<p>This graph of a cubic function is an example of a nonlinear equation.</p>

<p>Every inequality has a boundary line, which is the equation produced by changing the inequality relation to an equals sign.
The boundary line is  drawn as a dashed line (if <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
is used) or a solid line (if <span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
is used). One side of the boundary will have points that satisfy the inequality, and the other side will have points that falsify it. By testing individual points, the correct region can be shaded.
If we have two inequalities, therefore, we shade in the <em>overlap</em> region, where both inequalities are simultaneously satisfied.
</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the system including the parabolic nonlinear inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y&gt;x^2$</div>

<p>and the linear inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y &lt; x+2$</div>

<p>All points below the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x+2$</span>
satisfy the linear equality, and all points above the parabola <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
satisfy the parabolic nonlinear inequality.</p>
<p>Graphing both inequalities reveals one region of overlap: the area where the parabola dips below the line. This area is the solution to the system.</p>



<a href='../images/1127.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/1127.png' alt='Nonlinear system of inequalities'></a>

<div><b><i>Nonlinear system of inequalities</i></b></div>
<p>Any point in the region between the line <span class='clFormula'>$y=x+2$</span>
 and the parabola <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
 satisfies the system of inequalities.</p>

<p>The limits of each inequality intersect at <span class='clFormula'>$(-1, 1)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(2, 4)$</span>
. Note that the area above <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^2$</span>
that is also below <span class='clFormula'>$ y=x+2$</span>
 is closed between those two points. Whereas a solution for a linear system of equations will contain an infinite, unbounded area (lines can only pass one another a maximum of once), in many instances, a solution for a nonlinear system of equations will consist of a finite, bounded area.</p>
<p>This need not be the case with all nonlinear inequalities, but reversing the direction of both inequalities in the previous example would lead to an infinite solution area.</p>
