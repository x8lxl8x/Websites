<h3 id='concept_368'>2.1.1. Introduction to Variables</h3>

<blockquote>Variables are used in mathematics to denote  arbitrary or unknown numbers.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Describe the uses of variables in mathematics</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Variables are generally alphabetic characters that represent numbers and are useful in mathematics for several purposes.</li>
<li>Parameters of equations are often denoted with variables (such as <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
) and are part of the given information in an equation.</li>
<li>Unknown variables are those that must be solved for in equations and are often denoted with variables such as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>variable</dt>
<dd>An alphabetic character representing a number that is arbitrary or unknown.</dd>
<dt>term</dt>
<dd>A value or expression separated from other such values by an operation.</dd>
<dt>parameter</dt>
<dd>A number or variable in an equation that is considered "known".</dd>
<dt>coefficient</dt>
<dd>A quantity (usually a number) that remains the same in value within a problem.</dd>
<dt>unknown</dt>
<dd>A variable in an equation that has to be solved for.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In elementary mathematics, a variable is an alphabetic character representing a number, called the <em>value</em> of the variable, that is arbitrary, not fully specified, or unknown.</p>
<p>Variables are useful for several reasons.</p>





<h3>Unknown Values</h3>

<p>Variables can represent numbers whose values are not yet known.
For example, if the temperature of the current day, <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
, is 20 degrees
higher than the temperature of the previous day, <span class='clFormula'>$P$</span>
, then the problem can
be described algebraically as
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle C=P+20$</span>
.</p>

<h3>General Formulas</h3>

<h3>Varying Quantities</h3>

<p>Variables may describe mathematical relationships between quantities that  vary. For example, the relationship between the circumference, <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
, and diameter, <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
, of a circle is described by <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \pi =C/d$</span>
.</p>
<p>Variables may also describe general problems without specifying the values of the quantities involved. For example, it can be stated specifically that 5 minutes is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle 60\times 5=300$</span>
 seconds. A more general (algebraic) description may state the number of seconds as <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle s=60\times m$</span>
 , where <span class='clFormula'>$m$</span>
 is the number of minutes.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Properties</h3>

<p>Variables may describe some mathematical properties. For example, a basic property of addition is commutativity, which states that the order of numbers being added together does not matter. Commutativity is stated algebraically as
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle (a+b)=(b+a)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Types of Variables</h3>

<p>Variables can be used to represent different types of numbers. It is common that many variables appear in the same mathematical formula, and they may play different roles. Some names or qualifiers have been
introduced to distinguish them. </p>
<p>For example, in the general cubic equation
<span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d=0$</span>
, there are five variables. Four of them (<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
) represent given numbers, which are referred to as the <em>parameters </em>of the equation. The last one, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, represents the solution of the equation, which is unknown and must be solved for. To distinguish among the different variables,  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is called an <em>unknown</em>, and the variables that are multiplied by  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
are called coefficients. In this equation, the coefficients are <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
. A number on its own (without an unknown variable) is called a constant; in this case, <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
represents a constant.</p>
<p>Note that a term of an equation is any value (variable or number) or expression that is separated from another term by a space or a character (such as "<span class='clFormula'>$+$</span>
"). Therefore, a term may simply be a constant or a variable, or it may include both a coefficient and an unknown variable. In the cubic equation described above, there are four terms: <span class='clFormula'>$ax^3$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$bx^2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$cx$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
. </p>
<p>Note that unknown variables are often denoted by <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$z$</span>
and the parameters of equations by <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$d$</span>
. However, this is not always the case. For example, you might be asked to solve the following equation for <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
:  </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$12 - b = 3$</span>
 </p>
<p>In this case, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
is an unknown variable, not a parameter of the equation. We can solve this problem and find that <span class='clFormula'>$b = 9$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_369'>2.1.2. Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Expressions</h3>

<blockquote>Simplifying algebraic expressions involves combining like terms, often through addition and subtraction.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Use the concept of like terms to add and subtract expressions containing variables</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>"Like terms" are terms in algebraic expressions that  are constants or that involve the same variables raised to the same exponents (e.g., <span class='clFormula'>$6x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
; <span class='clFormula'>$14y$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$3y$</span>
).</li>
<li>In algebraic expressions, like terms can be combined through addition and subtraction: <span class='clFormula'>$2{x}^{2}+3ab-{x}^{2}+ab={x}^{2}+4ab$</span>
.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>like terms</dt>
<dd>Entities that involve the same variables raised to  the same exponents.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Like Terms</h3>

<p>Every algebraic expression is made up of one or more terms. Terms
in these expressions are separated by the operators <span class='clFormula'>$+$</span>
 or <span class='clFormula'>$-$</span>
. For instance, in the
expression <span class='clFormula'>$x + 5$</span>
, there are two terms; in the expression <span class='clFormula'>$2x^2$</span>
, there is only one term.</p>
<p> Terms are called <em>like terms</em> if they involve  the same variables and exponents. All constants are also like terms.</p>
<p>For example, <span class='clFormula'>$5x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x^2$</span>
are like terms because they involve the same variable, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, raised to the same exponent, 2. Likewise, the following are examples of like terms:</p>
<ul>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$25x$</span></li>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$y^4$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$12y^4$</span></li>
<li> 13 and 42</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that terms that share a variable but not an exponent are <em>not </em>like terms. Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$2x^3$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$2x^2$</span>
are <em>not </em>like terms because they have different exponents (3 and 2). Likewise, terms that share an exponent but have different variables are <em>not </em>like terms. Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$2x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$2y^2$</span>
are <em>not</em> like terms, because they have different variables (<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
).</p>

<h3>Combining Like Terms</h3>

<h3>Expressions with Two Terms</h3>

<p>We can simplify an algebraic expression by combining  like terms. For example, let's try simplifying <span class='clFormula'>$3x + 6x$</span>
.</p>


<p>First, let's write both terms as addition problems:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x = x + x + x$</div>

<li> <span class='clFormula'>$6x = x + x + x + x + x + x$</span>
. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adding these terms together, we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x + 6x = x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x$</div>

<p>If you count, you'll find that there are 9 <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
s in this expanded expression. Therefore:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x+6x=9x$</div>

<p>Note that the expression we started with, <span class='clFormula'>$3x + 6x$</span>
, had only two terms. When an expression contains more than two terms, it may be
helpful to rearrange the terms so that like terms are together. </p>

<h3>Expressions with More than Two Terms</h3>

<p>The commutative property of addition
says that we can change the order of  terms without changing the meaning of the expression (the sum).
So, we can rearrange the order of the following expression before attempting to combine like
terms: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4a + 6b + 2a +b$</div>

<p>We can identify that <span class='clFormula'>$4a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$2a$</span>
are like terms, as are <span class='clFormula'>$6b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. We want to rearrange the expression  to group  like terms together:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$4a + 2a + 6b +b$</span>
.</p>
<p> Now we can more easily add the like terms together to simplify the expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(4a + 2a) + (6b +b) = 6a + 7b$</div>

<p>The same rules apply when an expression involves subtraction. However, be careful that when you changing the order of terms you ensure that the minus sign follows the term that it applies to. For example, consider <span class='clFormula'>$2x - 3 + 5x$</span>
. This expression is properly rearranged and simplified as follows:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$2x-3 + 5x = 2x + 5x - 3 = 7x - 3$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In summary, there are three steps to combining like terms:</p>
<p>1. Identify all like terms.
</p>
<p>2. Rearrange the expression so the like terms are grouped together.
</p>
<p>3. Add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms until there are as few of each kind of term as possible.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$4x^2 + 3xy - y - 2x^2 + 5xy$</span>
 </p>
<p>First, identify the like terms: <span class='clFormula'>$4x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-2x^2$</span>
,  <span class='clFormula'>$3xy$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$5xy$</span>
. Now group these like terms together: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4x^2 - 2x^2 + 3xy + 5xy - y  $</div>

<p>Add and subtract the coefficients of the like terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2x^2 + 8xy - y$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-5x^2 + 3x + 3y - 3x + 21x^2 $</div>

<p>First, identify the like terms: <span class='clFormula'>$-5x^2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$21x^2$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-3x$</span>
. Now group these like terms together: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$-5x^2 + 21x^2 + 3x - 3x + 3y $</span>
 </p>
<p>Add and subtract the coefficients of the like terms. Notice that the terms <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$-3x$</span>
cancel, because <span class='clFormula'>$3x - 3x = 0$</span>
. The expression therefore simplifies to:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$16x^2 + 3y $</div>


<h3 id='concept_370'>2.1.3. Multiplying Algebraic Expressions</h3>

<blockquote>The  process for multiplying algebraic expressions differs for monomials and polynomials.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Calculate the product of expressions containing variables</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>To multiply two monomials, multiply the integer coefficients together and add the exponents of any variables that are the same.</li>
<li>To multiply a monomial by a polynomial, multiply the monomial by each individual term in the polynomial.</li>
<li>To multiply two binomials, follow the FOIL method: multiply the First, Outside, Inside, and Last terms before adding all the resulting terms together.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>binomial</dt>
<dd>A polynomial with two terms.</dd>
<dt>polynomial</dt>
<dd>An algebraic expression with more than one term.</dd>
<dt>monomial</dt>
<dd>A single term consisting of a product of numbers and variables.</dd>
<dt>trinomial</dt>
<dd>A polynomial with three terms.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Multiplication of Two Monomials</h3>

<p>A monomial is a single term consisting of a product of numbers and variables. It is a relative of the polynomial, which is an algebraic expression with more than one term. The following are examples of monomials:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$6xy$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$12$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$4x^2$</div>

</ul>
<p>(Note that multiplying monomials is not the same as adding algebraic expressions—monomials do not have to involve "like terms" in order to be combined together through multiplication.)</p>
<p>When you multiply monomials, you multiply their integer coefficients together and, if they contain any of the same variables, add the exponents on those variables  together. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(3x^2)(4x) = 12x^3$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(4xy)(5y^2) = 20xy^3$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(9)(2y^2) = 18y^2$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(5x)(3y) = 15xy$</div>

</ul>

<h3>Multiplication of Monomials and Polynomials</h3>

<p>A monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of any size (note that a polynomial is called a binomial if it has two terms and a trinomial if it has three terms). The monomial should be multiplied by each term in the polynomial separately. Any negative sign on a term should be included in the multiplication of that term. The resulting polynomial will have the same number of terms as the polynomial in the problem.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2x)(x^2 + 5) = 2x^3 + 10x$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$7(x^2y + 5) = 7x^2y + 35$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(x^3)(y^2 - 2x + 4) = x^3y^2 - 2x^4 + 4x^3$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$-3x(2xy - 3y^2 - 2) = -6x^2y + 9xy^2 + 6x$</div>

</ul>

<h3>Multiplication of Two Binomials</h3>

<p>Multiplying two binomials is less straightforward; however, there is a method that makes the process fairly convenient. "FOIL" is a mnemonic for the standard method of multiplying two binomials (hence the method is often referred to as the FOIL method). The word FOIL is an acronym for the four terms of the product:</p>


<ul>
<li>First (the "first" terms of each binomial are multiplied together)</li>
<li>Outer (the "outside" terms are multiplied—i.e., the first term of the first binomial with the second term of the second)</li>
<li>
Inner (the "inside" terms are multiplied—i.e., the second term of the first binomial with the first term of the second)</li>
<li>
Last (the "last" terms of each binomial are multiplied together)</li>
</ul>




<p>Once this process is complete, all the  resulting terms are added together into a single polynomial.</p>
<p>The FOIL method can be written algebraically:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$</div>

<ul>
<li>First terms: <span class='clFormula'>$ac$</span></li>
<li>Outside terms: <span class='clFormula'>$ad$</span></li>
<li>Inside terms: <span class='clFormula'>$bc$</span></li>
<li>Last terms: <span class='clFormula'>$bd$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that any negative sign on a term in a binomial should also be included in the multiplication of that term. Additionally, remember to simplify the resulting polynomial if possible by combining like terms.</p>

<h3>Example of Multiplying Binomials</h3>

<p>Multiply the following binomials: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2x + 1)(3x - 2)$</div>

<p>Following the FOIL method, multiply the first, outside, inside, and last terms:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$F: (2x)(3x) = 6x^2 \\&#10;O: (2x)(-2) = -4x \\&#10;I: (1)(3x) = 3x \\&#10;L: (2)(-2) = -2 $</div>

<p>Now add all of these terms together:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$6x^2 - 4x + 3x - 2$</div>

<p>Notice that two of these terms are like terms (<span class='clFormula'>$-4x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$3x$</span>
) and can therefore be added together to simplify the expression further: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$6x^2 - x - 2$</div>


<h3 id='concept_81'>2.1.4. Simplifying Radical Expressions</h3>

<blockquote>A radical expression that contains variables can often be simplified to a more basic expression, much as can expressions involving only integers.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Simplify radical expressions containing variables</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>If a radical is fully simplified, there is no factor of the radicand that can be written as a power greater than or equal to the index, there are no fractions under the radical sign, and there are no radicals in the denominator.</li>
<li>When radical expressions contain variables, simplifying them follows the same process as it does for expressions containing only integers.</li>
<li>Similarly, the rules for multiplying and dividing radical expressions still apply when the expressions contain variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>radicand</dt>
<dd>The number or expression whose square root or other root is being considered; e.g., the 3 in <equation>$\sqrt[n]{3}$</equation>. More simply, the number under the root symbol.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Radical Expressions</h3>

<p>Expressions that include roots are known as radical expressions. Recall that the <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
th root of a number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is a number <span class='clFormula'>$r$</span>
that, when raised to the power of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
, equals <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>${r}^{n}=x$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is the degree of the root. A root of degree 2 is called a square root;  a root of degree 3 is called a cube root. Roots of higher degrees are referred to using ordinal numbers (e.g., fourth root, twentieth root, etc.).</p>

<h3>Simplified Form</h3>

<p>A radical expression is said to be in simplified form if:</p>

<ol>
<li>there is no factor of the radicand that can be written as a power greater than or equal to the index,</li>
<li>there are no fractions under the radical sign, and</li>
<li>there are no radicals in the denominator.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For example, let's write the radical expression <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt { \frac { 32 }{ 5 } }$</span>
 in simplified form, we can proceed as follows. First, look for a perfect square under the square root sign, and remove it:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \sqrt { \frac { 32 }{ 5 } } =\sqrt { \frac { 16\cdot 2 }{ 5 } } = \sqrt {4^2 \cdot \frac { 2 }{ 5 } }= 4\sqrt { \frac { 2 }{ 5 } }$</div>

<p>Next, separate the fraction under the radical sign:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle 4\sqrt { \frac { 2 }{ 5 } } =\frac { 4\sqrt { 2 } }{ \sqrt { 5 } }$</div>

<p>Finally,  remove the radical from the denominator:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle 4\sqrt { \frac { 2 }{ 5 } } =\frac { 4\sqrt { 2 } }{ \sqrt { 5 } } \cdot \frac { \sqrt { 5 } }{ \sqrt { 5 } } =\frac { 4\sqrt { 10 } }{ 5 }$</div>


<h3>Radical Expressions with Variables</h3>

<p>For the purposes of simplification, radical expressions  containing variables are treated no differently from expressions containing  integers. For example, consider the following: <span class='clFormula'>$$</span></p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{4x^2} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} = 2x$</div>

<p>This follows the same logic that we used above, when simplifying the radical expression with integers: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$</div>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{\sqrt{16x^7}}{\sqrt[4]{x^2}}$</div>

<p>First, notice that there is a perfect square under the square root symbol, and pull that out:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{\sqrt{16x^7}}{\sqrt[4]{x^2}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{16}\sqrt{x^7}}{\sqrt[4]{x^2}}&#10;= \dfrac{4 \cdot \sqrt{x^7}}{\sqrt[4]{x^2}}&#10;= 4 \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{x^7}}{\sqrt[4]{x^2}}$</div>

<p>Recall that we can rewrite the numerator and denominator in rational exponent form, which will allow us to proceed with the division rule: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4 \cdot \dfrac{x^{\frac{7}{2}}}{x^{\frac{2}{4}}}$</div>

<p>Notice that the exponent in the denominator can be simplified, so we have:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4 \cdot \dfrac{x^{\frac{7}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{2}}}$</div>

<p>Recall the rule for dividing numbers with exponents, in which the exponents are subtracted. Applying the division rule yields:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$4 \cdot \dfrac{x^{\frac{7}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{2}}} &#10;= 4 \cdot x^{\frac{7}{2}-\frac{1}{2}} &#10;= 4 \cdot x^{\frac{6}{2}} &#10;= 4x^3$</div>

<blockquote>The rules for operating on numbers with exponents can be applied to variables with exponents as well.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Simplify exponential expressions containing variables</p>

<h4>Key Point</h4>

<ul>
<li>The rules for operating on exponential expressions are the same for expressions with variables as they are for those with only integers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for Exponential Expressions</h3>

<p>Recall the rules for operating on numbers with exponents, which are used when simplifying and solving problems in mathematics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: <span class='clFormula'>$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$</span></li>
<li>Dividing exponential expressions with the same base: <span class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{{a}^{m}}{{a}^{n}}={a}^{m-n}$</span></li>
<li>Raising an exponential expression to an exponent: <span class='clFormula'>${({a}^{n})}^{m}={a}^{n \cdot m}$</span></li>
<li>Raising a product to an exponent: <span class='clFormula'>${(ab)}^{n}={a}^{n}{b}^{n}$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, we have applied these rules only to expressions involving integers. However, they also apply to expressions involving a combination of both integers and variables. This makes them more broadly applicable in solving mathematics problems.</p>

<h3>Exponential Expressions with Variables</h3>

<p>In terms of conducting operations, exponential expressions that contain variables are treated just as though they are composed of integers. For example, consider the rule for multiplying two numbers with exponents. We know that <span class='clFormula'>$(2 \cdot 5)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2 $</span>
. The same rule applies to expressions with variables. The following statements therefore hold true:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(4a)^3 = 4^3 \cdot a^3$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(xy)^2 = x^2y^2$</div>

</ul>
<p>Each of the other rules for operating on numbers applies to expressions with variables as well. You will see how each of these applies in the following examples.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{4a^7}{a^2}$</div>

<p>Now apply the rule for dividing exponential expressions with the same base:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{4a^7}{a^2} = 4a^{\left(7-2\right)} = 4a^5$</div>


<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Simplify the following expression:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(a^3)(a^2) + (2b^2)^3$</div>

<p>To simplify the first part of the expression, apply the rule for multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(a^3)(a^2) = a^5$</div>

<p>To simplify the second part of the expression, apply the rule for multiplying numbers with exponents:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2b^2)^3 = (2)^3 \cdot (b^2)^3 $</div>

<p>Now, since we know that <span class='clFormula'>$2^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$</span>
, we can plug that in. We can also apply the rule for raising a power to another exponent:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2b^2)^3 = 8b^6$</div>

<p>Combining the two terms, our original expression simplifies to:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a^5 + 8b^6$</div>


<h3 id='concept_78'>2.1.6. Rational Algebraic Expressions</h3>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Manipulate rational expressions that contain variables</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Always factor rational expressions before doing anything else.</li>

<li>Once two rational expressions have the same denominator, their numerators can be combined. Then the overall remaining expression can be simplified.</li>

</dl>

<p>Adding and subtracting fractions should be a familiar process, and we will rely on this  concept in our discussion of adding and subtracting rational expressions.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac 1 2 +\frac 1 3 = \frac 3 6 + \frac 2 6 = \frac 5 6$</div>

<p>The key is finding the least common denominator of the two rational expressions: the smallest multiple of both denominators. Then, you rewrite the two fractions using this denominator. Finally, you add (or subtract) the fractions by combining the numerators and leaving the denominator alone.</p>
<p>But how do you find the least common denominator? </p>
<p>Consider this problem:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac 5 {12} + \frac 7 {30} = ?$</div>

<p>You could probably find the least common denominator if you played around with the numbers long enough. Here, we will show you a systematic method for finding least common denominators—a method that works with rational expressions just as well as it does with numbers. </p>

<h3>Finding the Least Common Denominator</h3>

<p>We start, as usual, by factoring. For each of the denominators, we find all the prime factors—i.e., the prime numbers that multiply to give that number.</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac 5 {2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} + \frac 7 {2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}$</div>

<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of prime factors, it may take a few minutes to get used to. <span class='clFormula'>$2\cdot 2 \cdot 3$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$12$</span>
broken into its prime factors: that is, it is the list of prime numbers that when multiplied together yield 12. Similarly, the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5. But why does this help? </p>
<p>Because <span class='clFormula'>$12=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$</span>
, any number whose prime factors include two 2s and one 3 will be a multiple of 12. Similarly, any number whose prime factors include a 2, a 3, and a 5 will be a multiple of 30.</p>



<a href='../images/0201.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0201.png' alt='Prime Factors of Fractions'></a>

<div><b><i>Prime Factors of Fractions</i></b></div>
<p>Finding the prime factors of the denominators of two fractions enables us to find a common denominator.</p>

<p>The least common denominator is the smallest number that contains the overlap of both factored denominators: in this case,  it must have two 2s, one 3, and one 5. Hence, the least common denominator must be <span class='clFormula'>$2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60$</span>
. </p>
<p>Now we can finish the problem:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \frac {5} {2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} + \frac {7} {2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5} &amp;= \left(\frac {5} {2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} \cdot \frac {5} {5} \right) + \left(\frac {7} {2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5} \cdot \frac {2} {2}\right) \\&#10;&amp;= \frac {25} {60} + \frac {14} {60}\\&#10;&amp;= \frac {39} {60} \\&#10;&amp;= \frac {13} {20} \end{align}$</div>

<p>This may look like a very strange way of solving problems that you have known how to solve since the third grade. However, you should spend a few minutes carefully following the above solution. Once you understand why <span class='clFormula'>$2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60$</span>
 is guaranteed to be the least common denominator, you have the key concept required to add and subtract rational expressions.</p>

<h3>Addition and Subtraction of Rational Expressions</h3>

<p>When applying this strategy to rational expressions, first look at the denominators of the two rational expressions and see if they are the same. If they are the same, then simply add or subtract the numerators from each other, leaving the denominator alone. If the two denominators are different, however, then you will need to use the above strategy of finding the least common denominator.</p>
<p>When we add or subtract rational expressions, we will not simply be considering the prime factors of integers when looking for the least common denominator. Rather, we will be looking for monomial and binomial factors that are common to both rational expressions. This requires factoring algebraic expressions. </p>
<p>For example, consider the expression <span class='clFormula'>$2x^2 + 4$</span>
. Note that each term of the expression is divisible by 2; therefore, this can be rewritten by dividing 2 out of each term: <span class='clFormula'>$(2)(x^2 + 2)$</span>
. This expression therefore has two factors: <span class='clFormula'>$2$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(x^2 + 2)$</span>
.</p>
<p>Follow the example below to see how this applies to solving addition and subtraction problems.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Subtract the following rational expressions:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac 3 {x^2y+2y}-\frac {4x}{x^2 + 2}$</div>

<p>We begin problems of this type by factoring. Notice that we can rewrite the first denominator in terms of its factors. We can pull <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
out of the binomial, since it appears in both terms: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^2y+2y = y(x^2 + 2)$</div>

<p>The denominator in the second fraction cannot be factored. The rational expressions therefore become:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac 3 {y(x^2 + 2)} - \frac {4x}{x^2 + 2}$</div>

<p>Notice the factors in the denominators. The first fraction has two factors: <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(x^2+2)$</span>
. The second fraction has only one factor: <span class='clFormula'>$(x^2 + 2)$</span>
.</p>
<p>Now, as above, we need to find the smallest possible overlap including all the factors in both of these denominators. Through this logic, the least common denominator must have one <span class='clFormula'>$(x^2+2)$</span>
and one <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. </p>
<p>We now rewrite both fractions with the common denominator (remember that if you multiply a denominator by a factor, you must also multiply the numerator of that fraction by the same factor):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac {3}{y(x^2+2)} - \frac {4x} {x^2+2} \cdot \dfrac{y}{y}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac {3}{y(x^2+2)} - \frac {4x(y)} {y(x^2+2)}$</div>

<p>Subtracting fractions is easy once you have a common denominator! Now we can simply subtract the numerators:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac {3-4xy} {y(x^2+2)}$</div>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p><em>First</em>, always factor rational expressions before doing anything else.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, follow the regular procedure for fractions, which in this case involves finding a common denominator. </p>
<p><em>Third</em>, subtract the numerators while leaving the denominator alone.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, simplify.</p>

<h3 id='concept_372'>2.2.1. What is an Equation?</h3>

<blockquote>In an equation with one variable, the variable has a solution, or value, that makes the equation true.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Explain what an equation in one variable represents and the reasons for using one</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>An
equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equivalence of two
expressions.</li>
<li>When an equation contains a variable, such as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, the variable is considered an unknown value. </li>
<li>The values of the variables that make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found by solving the equation. </li>
<li>A solution of an equation can be verified, or checked, by substituting in its value for the variable in the equation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>solution</dt>
<dd>A value that can be substituted for a variable to make an equation true.</dd>
<dt>unknown</dt>
<dd>A variable in an equation that needs to be solved for.</dd>
<dt>equation</dt>
<dd>A mathematical statement that asserts the equivalence of two
expressions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>An
equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equivalence of two
expressions. For example, the assertion that "two plus five equals seven" is represented by the equation <span class='clFormula'>$2 + 5 = 7$</span>
.</p>
<p>In many cases, an equation contains one or more variables. These are still  written by placing each expression on either side
of an equals sign (<span class='clFormula'>$=$</span>
). For example, the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x + 3 = 5$</span>
, read "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 plus three equals five", asserts that the expression <span class='clFormula'>$x+3$</span>
 is equal to the value 5.</p>
<p>It is possible for equations to have more than one variable. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$x + y + 7 = 13$</span>
is an equation in two variables. However, this lesson focuses solely on equations in one variable.</p>

<h3>Solving Equations</h3>

<p>When an equation contains a variable such as <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, this variable is considered an <em>unknown</em> value. In many cases, we can find the possible values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
that would make the equation true. <span class='clFormula'>$$</span></p>
<p>For example, consider the  equation we were talking about above: <span class='clFormula'>$x + 3 =5$</span>
. You have probably already guessed that the only possible value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is 2, because you know that <span class='clFormula'>$2 + 3 = 5$</span>
is a true equation. We use an equals sign to show that we know the value of a given variable. In this case, we write <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
(read as "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
equals two").</p>
<p>The values of the variables that make an equation true are called the  <em>solutions</em> of the equation. In turn,  solving
an equation means determining what values for the variables make
the equation a true statement. </p>
<p>The equation above was fairly straightforward; it was easy for us to identify the solution as <span class='clFormula'>$x = 2$</span>
. However, it becomes useful to have a process for finding solutions for unknowns as problems become more complex.</p>

<h3>Verifying Solutions </h3>

<p>If a number is found as a solution to an equation, then substituting that number back into the place of the variable should make the equation true. Thus, we can easily  check whether a number is a genuine solution to a given equation.</p>
<p>For example, let's examine whether <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
is a solution to the equation  <span class='clFormula'>$2x + 31 = 37$</span>
.</p>
<p>Substituting 3 for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, we have: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2(3) + 31 = 37 \\&#10;6 + 31 = 37$</div>

<p>This equality is a true statement. Therefore, we can conclude that <span class='clFormula'>$x = 3$</span>
is, in fact, a solution to the equation <span class='clFormula'>$2x+31=37$</span>
.</p>

</dl>

<p>An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equivalence of two expressions. In modern notation, this is indicated by placing the expressions on either side of an equal sign (=). For example, <span class='clFormula'>$x+3=5$</span>
asserts that <span class='clFormula'>$x+3$</span>
is equal to 5.</p>
<p>Equations often express relationships between given quantities ("knowns") and quantities yet to be determined ("unknowns"). By mathematical convention, unknowns are denoted by letters toward the end of the alphabet <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y,z...)$</span>
, while knowns are denoted by letters at the beginning of the alphabet <span class='clFormula'>$(a,b,c...)$</span>
. </p>
<p>The process of expressing an equation's unknowns in terms of its knowns is called <em>solving the equation</em>. In an equation with a single unknown, a value of that unknown for which the equation is true is called a solution<em> </em>or<em> </em>root of the equation. </p>
<p>If an equation in algebra is known to be true, the following properties may be used to produce another true equation. For each property, both the formal definition and the plain-English definition are provided.</p>

<h3>The Addition Property of Equality</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$a=b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$a+c=b+c$</span>
.</p>
<p>In other words, any real number can be added to both sides of an equation.</p>

<h3>The Subtraction Property of Equality</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$a=b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$a-c=b-c$</span>
.</p>
<p>In other words, any real number can be subtracted from both sides of an equation.</p>

<h3>The Multiplication Property of Equality</h3>

<p> If <span class='clFormula'>$a=b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$ca=cb$</span>
.</p>
<p>In other words, any real number can be multiplied to both sides of an equation.</p>

<h3>The Division Property of Equality</h3>

<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$a=b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c\neq 0$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{a}{c}=\dfrac{b}{c}$</span>
.</p>
<p>In other words, any non-zero real number can divide both sides of an equation.</p>

<h3>Solving Equations using the Properties of Equality</h3>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>The bill for the repair of a car was \$458, and the cost of parts was \$339.  The cost of labor was \$34 per hour. Write and solve an equation to find the number of hours of labor that went into the repair.</p>
<p>Let <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 equal the unknown value: the number of hours of labor. The equation is therefore:</p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$34x+339=458$</span>
.  </p>
<p>In English, the cost of the labor (\$34) multiplied by the number of hours of labor <span class='clFormula'>$(x)$</span>
, plus the cost of the parts (\$339), is equal to the total bill for the repair (\$458).</p>
<p> To solve for the unknown, first undo the addition operation (using the subtraction property) by subtracting \$339 from both sides of the equation: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 34x+339-339&amp;=458-339 \\ 34x&amp;=458-339 \\ 34x&amp;=119 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Then undo the multiplication operation (using the division property) by dividing both sides of the equation by 34: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{34x}{34}&amp; =\dfrac{119}{34} \\ x&amp; =\dfrac{119}{34} \\ x&amp;=3.5 \end{align}$</div>

<p>This means the car repair labor took 3.5 hours.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Solve the following equation using  properties of equality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{1}{8}x-5=3$</div>

<p>First, use the addition property to add 5 to both sides of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{1}{8}x-5+5&amp;=3+5 \\ \dfrac{1}{8}x&amp;=3+5 \\ \dfrac{1}{8}x&amp;=8 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Second, use the multiplication property to multiply both sides of the equation by 8:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 8 \cdot \dfrac{1}{8}x&amp;= 8 \cdot 8 \\ x&amp;=64 \end{align} $</div>

<p>This is the solution to the equation.</p>

<h3>Solving a Rational Equation (Same Denominators) </h3>

<p>For an equation that involves two fractions or rational expressions, <em>cross-multiplying</em> is a helpful strategy for simplifying the equation or determining the value of a variable.</p>
<p>For example, start with the following  equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac {x}{8} = \dfrac {3}{8}$</div>

<p>Cross-multiplying yields: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 8x&amp;=8\cdot 3 \\ 8x&amp;=24 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, by dividing both sides of the equation by <span class='clFormula'>$8$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{8x}{8}&amp;=\dfrac{24}{8} \\ x&amp;=3 \end{align}$</div>

<p>We could also use simple algebra. Start with the same equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac {x}{8} = \dfrac {3}{8}$</div>

<p>Isolate the variable on the left by multiplying both sides by <span class='clFormula'>$8$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left(\dfrac{8}{1} \right)\cdot \dfrac{x}{8}= \left(\dfrac{8}{1} \right) \cdot \dfrac{3}{8}$</div>

<p>The  denominators on both sides cancel out, yielding:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=3$</div>

<p>You could also come to this conclusion through deductive reasoning. Notice that the rational expressions on both sides of the equal sign have the same denominator. If you have a rational equation where the denominators on either side of the equation are the same, <em>then their respective numerators must also be the same value</em>, even though they might be expressed in different terms. This suggests a strategy: Find a common denominator,  set the numerators equal to each other, and solve for any unknowns.</p>

<h3>Solving a Rational Equation (Different Denominators) </h3>

<p>Several real-life situations can be modeled using equations that set two fractions, or ratios, to be equal to each other—for example, finding unknown dimensions of certain shapes.</p>
<p>Two triangles are said to be "similar" if they have equal corresponding angles. This is the same as the triangles having equal side-length ratios.</p>



<a href='../images/0202.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0202.png' alt='Similar geometric shapes'></a>

<div><b><i>Similar geometric shapes</i></b></div>
<p>Two geometrical objects are  similar if they both have the same shape or if one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. In this image, figures shown in the same color are similar.</p>

<p>The two triangles below are similar. If length <span class='clFormula'>$\overline{AC}$</span>
 is 10 inches, <span class='clFormula'>$\overline{EF}$</span>
 is 14 inches, and <span class='clFormula'>$\overline{AB}$</span>
 is 17 inches, what is the length of <span class='clFormula'>$\overline{EG}$</span>
?</p>



<a href='../images/0203.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0203.png' alt='Similar triangles'></a>

<div><b><i>Similar triangles</i></b></div>
<p>Corresponding angles in similar shapes are marked with the same symbol. For example, <span class='clFormula'>$\angle A$</span>
 (i.e., angle <span class='clFormula'>$A$</span>
) corresponds to <span class='clFormula'>$\angle E$</span>
, and they are equal.</p>

<p>Let's start by writing a rational equation:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{\overline{AC}}{\overline{EF}}=\dfrac{\overline{AB}}{\overline{EG}}$</span>
 </p>
<p>Now let's plug in the actual numbers:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{10}{14}=\dfrac{17}{x}$</div>

<p>Now cross-multiply:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{10}{14}\cdot (x) \cdot (14)&amp;=\dfrac{17}{x} \cdot (x) \cdot (14) \\ 10\cdot x&amp;=14\cdot 17 \\ 10x&amp;=238 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 10:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x=23.8 $</span>
 inches.</p>

<h3 id='concept_137'>2.2.4. Radical Equations</h3>

<blockquote>Equations involving radicals are often solved by  squaring both sides.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve a radical equation by squaring both sides of the equation and checking for false solutions</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>When solving equations that involve radicals, begin by asking: is there an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
under the square root? The answer to this question will determine the way you approach the problem.</li>
<li>If there is not an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
under the square root—if only numbers are under the radicals—the equation can be solved in much the same way as if it contained no radicals.</li>
<li>However, if there is an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
under a square root, then move everything except that radical to one side, and then square both sides of the equation.</li>
<li>Squaring both sides can potentially introduce  extraneous solutions (i.e., false answers), so it is important to check your answers after solving!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

</dl>

<p>When solving equations that involve radicals, begin by asking: is there an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
under the square root? The answer to this question will determine the way the problem is approached. If there is not an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
under the square root—if only numbers are under the radicals—the problem can be solved much the same way as if it had no radicals. </p>

<h3>Solving Radical Equations without Variables Under the Radical Symbol</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Solve this equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt 2 x+5=7-\sqrt 3 x$</div>

<p>First, isolate the variable on one side of the equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \sqrt 2 x+\sqrt 3 x+5-5&amp;=7-5-\sqrt 3 x + \sqrt 3 x \\ \sqrt 2x+\sqrt 3x&amp;=7-5 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Next, since both terms on the left hand side of the equation contain <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, factor out the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. (Remember that <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt 2  $</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt 3$</span>
 are unlike terms and cannot be combined.)</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3)=2$</div>

<p>Now divide both sides of the equation by <span class='clFormula'>$(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3)$</span>
 to solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac 2 {\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3}$</div>

<p>The key thing to note about  problems like this is that both sides of the equation do not have to be squared. <span class='clFormula'>$2\sqrt{2}$</span>
may look complicated, but it is just a number—it functions in the equation just the way that the number <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$\frac {1}{3}$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$\pi$</span>
would.</p>

<h3>Steps to Solve a Radical Equation with a Variable Under the Radical</h3>

<p>If there is an <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, or variable, under the square root, the problem must be approached differently. In this case, both sides must be squared to get rid of the radical. However, squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions (i.e., false answers), so it is important to check the answers after solving. If no answer checks out, then the solution is "no solution."</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Solve this equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{6x-2}-3=7$</div>

<p>First, isolate the radical:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \sqrt{6x-2}-3+3&amp;=7+3 \\ \sqrt{6x-2}&amp;=10 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now, to undo the radical symbol (square root), square both sides of the equation (recall that squaring a square root removes the radical):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \left(\sqrt{6x-2}\right)^2&amp;=(10)^2 \\ 6x-2&amp;=100 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Finally, solve the remaining equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 6x-2+2&amp;=100+2 \\ 6x&amp;=102 \\ \dfrac{6x}{6}&amp;=\dfrac{102}{6} \\ x&amp;=17 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now, let's go back and check our answer:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \sqrt {6(17)-2}-3&amp;=7 \\ \sqrt {6(17)-2}&amp;=10 \\ \left(\sqrt {6(17)-2}\right)^2&amp;=(10)^2 \\ 6(17)-2&amp;=100 \\ 6(17)&amp;=102 \\ 17&amp;=17 \end{align} $</div>

<p>This is a true statement. Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$x=17$</span>
 is a valid solution to the equation <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt{6x-2}-3=7$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Solving Radical Equations with False Solutions</h3>

<p>Solve this equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-5-\sqrt{10x-2}=5$</div>

<p>Isolate the radical symbol (square root):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} -5-\sqrt{10x-2}+5&amp;=5+5 \\ -\sqrt{10x-2}&amp;=10 \\ (-1) \cdot (-\sqrt{10x-2})&amp;=(-1) \cdot (10) \\ \sqrt{10x-2}&amp;=-10 \end{align} $</div>

<p> Now, square both sides of the equation, and solve:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \left( \sqrt{10x-2} \right) ^2&amp;= (-10) ^2 \\ 10x-2&amp;=100 \\ 10x-2+2&amp;=100+2 \\ 10x&amp;=102 \\ \dfrac{10x}{10}&amp;=\dfrac{102}{10} \\ x&amp;=10.2 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Once we check this result, however, we discover that  <span class='clFormula'>$\sqrt {100}=-10$</span>
. This is incorrect, because the square root is defined to be only the positive root, <span class='clFormula'>$10$</span>
. This means that <span class='clFormula'>$10.2$</span>
 is an <em>extraneous solution</em>. Because it is the only answer we found, the answer to this problem is "no solution."</p>
<p>This problem demonstrates how important it is to check your solutions whenever you square both sides of an equation.</p>

<h3 id='concept_138'>2.2.5. Equations with Absolute Value</h3>

<blockquote>To solve an equation with an absolute value, first isolate the absolute value, and then solve for the positive and negative cases.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Break down an absolute value equation into two equations to solve for the variable</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Absolute values are always positive, since they represent distance.</li>
<li> An absolute value equation can have one, two, or no solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>absolute value</dt>
<dd>The magnitude (i.e., non-negative value) of a number without regard to its sign; a number's distance from zero.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Absolute value is one of the simplest functions—and paradoxically, one of the most problematic.  At face value, nothing could be simpler: absolute value simply means  <em>the distance a number is from </em>zero.  The absolute value of <span class='clFormula'>$-5$</span>
 is <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
, and the absolute value of <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 is also <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
, since both <span class='clFormula'>$-5$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 are <span class='clFormula'>$5$</span>
 units away from <span class='clFormula'>$0$</span>
. Mathematically, this is represented as follows: </p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\left | -5 \right |=5$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$\left| 5 \right| =5$</span></p>
<p>The following number line also illustrates this definition:</p>



<a href='../images/0204.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0204.png' alt='Absolute value'></a>

<div><b><i>Absolute value</i></b></div>
<p>The absolute value of a real number may be thought of as its distance from zero. In this image, for example, <span class='clFormula'>$\left | -3 \right |=3$</span>
.</p>


<h3>Types of Solutions to Absolute Value Equations</h3>

<p>Consider the following three equations. They look very similar—only the number changes—but the solutions are completely different. These three equations demonstrate how absolute value equations can have one, two, or no solutions. </p>

<h3>Equation 1</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$\left| x \right| =10$</div>

<p>What value(s) will make this equation true?</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x=10$</span>
 works, as does <span class='clFormula'>$x=-10$</span>
. Therefore our solution is:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x=\pm 10$</div>


<h3>Equation 2</h3>


<div class='clFormula'>$\left| x \right| =-10$</div>

<p>Here, neither <span class='clFormula'>$x=10$</span>
 nor <span class='clFormula'>$x=-10$</span>
 works. Recall that absolute value is a measure of distance, so it can never be a negative value. This equation therefore has <em>no solution</em>.</p>

<h3>Equation 3</h3>

<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\left| x \right| =0$</span></p>
<p>What value(s) will make this equation true? <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
is the only solution.</p>

<h3>Solving Absolute Value Equations</h3>

<p>The following steps describe how to solve an absolute value equation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Isolate the absolute value term algebraically.</li>
<li>Set up two separate equations: For the first, keep the new equation you found in step 1, but remove the absolute value signs; for the second, keep the equation you found in step 1, remove the absolute value signs, <em>and</em> multiply one side by -1.</li>
<li>Solve the pair of equations.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let's solve the following equation for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3\left| 2x+1 \right| -7=5$</div>


<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>First, algebraically isolate the absolute value by adding 7 to both sides of equation and then dividing both sides by 3:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3 \left| 2x+1 \right| -7 +7 &amp;=5 +7 \\ 3 \left| 2x+1 \right| &amp;= 12 \\ \dfrac{3 \left| 2x+1 \right|}{3} &amp;= \dfrac{12}{3} \\ \left| 2x+1 \right| &amp;=4 \end{align} $</div>


<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Now, set up two separate equations. The first is the equation we found in Step 1, but with the absolute value signs removed:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2x+1 =4$</div>

<p>The second equation is the one we found in Step 1, with the absolute value signs removed, <em>and</em> with the other side multiplied by -1:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2x+1 =-4$</div>


<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Now, solve both equations. For the first:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 2x+1&amp;=4 \\ 2x+1-1&amp;=4-1 \\ 2x&amp;=3 \\ \dfrac{2x}{2}&amp;=\dfrac{3}{2} \\ x&amp;=\dfrac{3}{2} \end{align}$</div>

<p>For the second equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 2x+1&amp;=-4 \\ 2x+1-1&amp;=-4-1 \\ 2x&amp;=-5 \\ \dfrac{2x}{2}&amp;=\dfrac{-5}{2} \\ x&amp;=\dfrac{-5}{2} \end{align} $</div>

<p>Therefore, this problem has two answers:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{3}{2}$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$x=\dfrac{-5}{2}$</span></p>

<li>An inequality describes a relationship between two different values.</li>

</dl>

<p>In mathematics, inequalities are used to compare the relative size of values. They can be used to compare integers, variables, and various other algebraic expressions. A description of different types of inequalities follows.</p>

<h3>Strict Inequalities</h3>

<p>A strict inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different. In the same way that equations use an equals sign, =, to show that two values are equal, inequalities use signs to show  that two values are not equal and to describe their relationship. The strict inequality symbols are <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
.</p>
<p>Strict inequalities differ from the notation <span class='clFormula'>$a \neq b$</span>
, which means that <em>a</em> is not equal to <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. The <span class='clFormula'>$\neq$</span>
symbol does not say that one value is greater than the other or even that they can be compared in size.</p>
<p>In the two types of strict inequalities, <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is not equal to <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. To compare the size of the values, there are two types of relations:</p>

<ol>
<li>The notation <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; b$</span>
means that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is less than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. </li>
<li>The notation <span class='clFormula'>$a &gt; b$</span>
means that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>The meaning of these symbols can be easily remembered by noting that the "bigger" side of the inequality symbol (the open side) faces the larger number. The "smaller" side of the symbol (the point) faces the smaller number.</p>
<p>The above relations can be demonstrated on a number line. Recall that the values on a number line increase as you move to the right. The following therefore represents the relation <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is less than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
: </p>



<a href='../images/0205.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0205.png' alt=''></a>

<div><b><i>
<span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; b$</span></i></b></div>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is to the left of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
on this number line.</p>

<p>and the following demonstrates <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
being greater than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
: </p>



<a href='../images/0206.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0206.png' alt=''></a>

<div><b><i>
<span class='clFormula'>$a &gt; b$</span></i></b></div>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is to the right of <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
on this number line.</p>

<p>In general, note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; b$</span>
is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$b &gt; a$</span>
; for example, <span class='clFormula'>$7 &lt; 11$</span>
is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$11&gt; 7$</span>
.</li>
<li> <span class='clFormula'>$a &gt; b$</span>
is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$b &lt; a$</span>
; for example, <span class='clFormula'>$6 &lt; 9$</span>
is equivalent to <span class='clFormula'>$9 &gt; 6$</span>
.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Inequalities</h3>

<p>In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict:</p>
<ul>
<li>The notation <span class='clFormula'>$a \leq b$</span>
 means that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is less than <em>or equal to</em> <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
(or, equivalently, "at most" <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
).</li>
<li>The notation <span class='clFormula'>$a \geq b$</span>
means that <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is greater than <em>or equal to</em> <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
(or, equivalently, "at least" <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inequalities with Variables</h3>

<p>In addition to showing relationships between integers, inequalities can be used to show relationships between variables and integers.</p>
<p>For example, consider <span class='clFormula'>$x &gt; 5$</span>
. This would be read as "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is greater than 5" and indicates that the unknown variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
could be any value greater than 5, though not 5 itself. For a visualization of this, see the number line below:</p>



<a href='../images/0207.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0207.png' alt=''></a>

<div><b><i>
<span class='clFormula'>$x &gt; 5$</span></i></b></div>
<p>Note that the circle above the number 5 is open, indicating that 5 is not included in possible values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.</p>

<p>For another example, consider <span class='clFormula'>$x \leq 3$</span>
. This would be read as "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is less than or equal to 3" and indicates that the unknown variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
could be 3 or any value less than 3. For a visualization of this, see the number line below:</p>



<a href='../images/0208.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0208.png' alt=''></a>

<div><b><i>
<span class='clFormula'>$x \leq 3$</span></i></b></div>
<p>Note that the circle above the number 3 is filled, indicating that 3 is included in possible values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
.</p>

<p>Inequalities are demonstrated by coloring in an arrow over the appropriate range of the number line to indicate the possible values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. Note that an open circle is used if the inequality is strict (i.e., for inequalities using <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
), and a filled circle is used if the inequality is not strict (i.e., for inequalities using <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
).</p>

<h3>Solving Problems with Inequalities</h3>

<p>Recall that equations can be used to demonstrate the equality of math expressions involving various operations (for example: <span class='clFormula'>$x + 5 = 9$</span>
). Likewise, inequalities can be used to demonstrate  relationships between different expressions.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following inequalities:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$x - 7 &gt; 12$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$2x + 4 \leq 25$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$2x &lt; y - 3$</div>

</ul>
<p>Each of these represents the relationship between two different expressions.</p>
<p>One useful application of inequalities such as these is in problems that involve maximum or minimum values. </p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Jared has a boat with a maximum weight limit of 2,500 pounds. He wants to take as many of his friends as possible onto the boat, and he guesses that he and his friends weigh an average of 160 pounds. How many people can ride his boat at once?</p>
<p>This problem can be modeled with the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$160n \leq 2500$</div>

<p>where <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
is the number of people Jared can take on the boat. To see why this is so, consider the left side of the inequality. It represents the total weight of <span class='clFormula'>$n$</span>
people weighing 160 pounds each. The inequality states that the total weight of Jared and his friends should be <em>less than or equal to</em> the maximum weight of 2,500, which is the boat's weight limit.</p>
<p>There are steps that can be followed to solve an inequality such as this one. For now, it is important simply to understand the meaning of such statements and cases in which they might be applicable.</p>

<blockquote>Arithmetic operations can be  used to solve inequalities for all possible values of a variable.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve inequalities using the rules for operating on them</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>When you're performing algebraic operations on inequalities, it is important to
perform the same operation on both sides in order to preserve the truth of the
statement. </li>
<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by the same positive value, the resulting inequality is true.</li>
<li>If both sides are multiplied or divided by the same negative value, the direction of the inequality changes.</li>
<li>Inequalities involving variables can be solved to yield all possible values of the variable that make the statement true.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Term</h4>

<dl>
<dt>inequality</dt>
<dd>A statement that of two
quantities one is specifically less than or greater than another.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Operations on Inequalities</h3>

<p>When you're performing algebraic operations on inequalities, it is important to conduct precisely the same operation on both sides in order to preserve the truth of the statement.</p>
<p>Each arithmetic operation follows specific rules:</p>

<h3>Addition and Subtraction</h3>

<p>Any value <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
may be added to or subtracted from both sides of an inequality. That is to say, for any real numbers <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$a \leq b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$a + c \leq b + c$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$a - c \leq b - c$</span>
.
</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$a \geq b$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$a + c \geq b + c$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$a - c \geq b - c$</span>
.
</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the same value is added or subtracted from both sides, the resulting inequality remains true.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$12 &lt; 15$</div>

<p>Let's apply the rules outlined above by subtracting 3 from both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 12 - 3 &amp;&lt; 15 - 3 \\ 9 &amp;&lt; 12 \end{align}$</div>

<p>This statement is still true.</p>

<h3>Multiplication and Division</h3>

<p>The properties that deal with multiplication and division state that, for any real numbers, <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
, and non-zero <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
:
</p>
<p>
If <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is positive, then multiplying or dividing by <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
does not change the inequality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$a \geq b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c &gt;0$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$ac \geq bc$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{a}{c} \geq \dfrac{b}{c}$</span>
.
</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$a \leq b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c &gt; 0 $</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$ac \leq bc$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{a}{c} \leq \dfrac{b}{c}$</span>
.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
is negative, then multiplying or dividing by <span class='clFormula'>$c$</span>
inverts the inequality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If <span class='clFormula'>$a \geq b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c &lt;0 $</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$ac \leq bc$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{a}{c} \leq \dfrac{b}{c}$</span>
.
</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$a \leq b$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$c &lt; 0 $</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$ac \geq bc$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{a}{c} \geq \dfrac{b}{c}$</span>
.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Take note that multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number changes the direction of the inequality. In other words, a greater-than symbol becomes a less-than symbol, and vice versa. </p>
<p>To see these rules applied, consider the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$5 &gt; -3$</div>

<p>Multiplying both sides by 3 yields:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 5 (3) &amp;&gt; -3 (3) \\ 15 &amp;&gt; -9 \end{align}$</div>

<p>We see that this is a true statement, because 15 is greater than 9.</p>
<p>Now, multiply the same inequality by -3 (remember to change the direction of the symbol because we're multiplying by a negative number):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 5 (-3) &amp;&lt; -3 (-3) \\ -15 &amp;&lt; 9 \end{align}$</div>

<p>This statement also holds true. This demonstrates how crucial it is to change the direction of the greater-than or less-than symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.</p>

<h3>Solving Inequalities</h3>

<p>Solving an inequality that includes a variable gives all of the possible values that the variable can take that make the inequality true. To solve an inequality means to transform it such that  a variable is on one side of the symbol and a number or expression on the other side. Often, multiple operations are often required to transform an inequality in this way.</p>

<h3>Addition and Subtraction</h3>

<p>To see how the rules of addition and subtraction apply to solving inequalities, consider the following:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x - 8 \leq 17$</div>

<p>First, isolate <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} x - 8 + 8 &amp;\leq 17 + 8 \\ x &amp;\leq 25 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$x \leq 25$</span>
is the solution of <span class='clFormula'>$x - 8 \leq 17$</span>
. In other words, <span class='clFormula'>$x - 8 \leq 17$</span>
is true for any value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
that is less than or equal to 25.</p>

<h3>Multiplication and Division</h3>

<p>To see how the rules for multiplication and division apply, consider the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$2x &gt; 8$</div>

<p>Dividing both sides by 2 yields:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{2x}{2} &amp;&gt; \dfrac{8}{2} \\ x &amp;&gt; \dfrac{8}{2} \\ x &amp;&gt; 4 \end{align}$</div>

<p>The statement <span class='clFormula'>$x &gt; 4$</span>
is  therefore the solution to <span class='clFormula'>$2x &gt; 8$</span>
. In other words, <span class='clFormula'>$2x &gt; 8$</span>
is true for any value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
greater than 4. </p>
<p>Now, consider another inequality: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-\dfrac{y}{3} \leq 7$</div>

<p>Because of the negative sign involved, we must multiply by a negative number to solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. This means that we must also change the direction of the symbol:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \displaystyle -3 \left( -\frac{y}{3} \right) &amp;\geq -3 (7)\\ y &amp;\geq -3 (7) \\ y &amp;\geq -21 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Therefore, the solution to <span class='clFormula'>$-\frac{y}{3} \leq 7$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$y \geq -21$</span>
. The given statement is therefore true for any value of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
greater than or equal to <span class='clFormula'>$-21$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Solve the following inequality: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3y - 17 \geq 19$</div>

<p>First, add 17 to both sides:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3y - 17 + 17 &amp;\geq 19 + 17 \\ 3y &amp;\geq 36 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Next, divide both sides by 3:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \dfrac{3y}{3} &amp;\geq \dfrac{36}{3} \\ y &amp;\geq \dfrac{36}{3} \\ y &amp;\geq 12 \end{align}$</div>


<h3>Special Considerations</h3>

<p>Note that it would become problematic if we tried to multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by an unknown variable. If any variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is unknown, we cannot identify whether it has a positive or negative value. Because the rules for multiplying or dividing positive and negative numbers differ, we cannot follow this same rule when multiplying or dividing inequalities by variables. Variables can, however, be added or subtracted from both sides of an inequality.</p>





<h3 id='concept_140'>2.3.3. Compound Inequalities</h3>

<blockquote>A compound inequality involves three expressions, not two, but can also be solved to find the possible values for a variable.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve a compound inequality by balancing all three components of the inequality</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>A compound inequality is of the following form: <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x &lt; b$</span>

<li>There are two statements in a compound inequality. The first statement is <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x$</span>

</dl>

<h3>Defining Compound Inequalities</h3>

<p>A compound inequality is of the following form:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x &lt; b$</div>

<p>There are actually two statements here. The first statement is <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x$</span>
. The next statement is <span class='clFormula'>$x &lt; b$</span>
. This statement is therefore read as "<span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
is less than <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, and <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is less than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
."</p>
<p>The compound inequality <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x &lt; b$</span>
indicates "betweenness"—the number <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is between the numbers <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
. Without changing the meaning, the statement <span class='clFormula'>$a&lt;x$</span>
can also be read as <span class='clFormula'>$x&gt;a$</span>
. Therefore, the form <span class='clFormula'>$a &lt; x &lt; b$</span>
can also be read as "<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is greater than <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
, and at the same time is less than <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
." </p>
<p>Consider <span class='clFormula'>$4 &lt; x &lt; 9$</span>
. This states that <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is some number strictly between 4 and 9. For a visualization of this inequality, refer to the number line below. The numbers 4 and 9 are not included, so  we place open circles on these points.</p>

<div><b><i>
<span class='clFormula'>$4 &lt; x &lt; 9$</span></i></b></div>

<p>Similarly, consider <span class='clFormula'>$-2 &lt; z &lt; 0$</span>
. In this case, <span class='clFormula'>$z$</span>
is some number strictly between -2 and 0. Again, because the numbers -2 and 0 are not included, we place open circles on those points. </p>



<a href='../images/0210.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0210.png' alt=''></a>

<h3>
<span class='clFormula'>$$</span>
Solving Compound Inequalities</h3>

<p>Now consider <span class='clFormula'>$1 &lt; x + 6 &lt; 8$</span>
. The expression <span class='clFormula'>$x + 6$</span>
represents some number strictly between 1 and 8. However, the meaning of this is difficult to visualize—what does it mean to say that an <em>expression</em>, rather than a number, lies between two points? Not to worry—we can still find all possible values of not only the expression, but the variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
itself.</p>
<p>The statement <span class='clFormula'>$1 &lt; x + 6 &lt; 8$</span>
says that the quantity  <span class='clFormula'>$x + 6$</span>
is between 1 and 8, a statement that will be true for only certain values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. </p>
<p>To solve for possible values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, we need to get <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
by itself:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$1 - 6 &lt; x + 6 - 6 &lt; 8 - 6$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$-5 &lt; x &lt; 2$</div>

<p>  Therefore, we find that if <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is any number strictly between -5 and 2, the statement <span class='clFormula'>$1 &lt; x + 6 &lt; 8$</span>
will be true.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Solve <span class='clFormula'>$-3 &lt; \dfrac{-2x-7}{5} &lt; 7$</span>
.</p>
<p>Multiply each part to remove  the denominator from the middle expression: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-3\cdot (5) &lt; \dfrac{-2x-7}{5} \cdot (5) &lt; 7 \cdot (5)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$-15 &lt; -2x-7 &lt; 35$</div>

<p>Isolate <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 in the middle of the inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$- 15 + 7 &lt; -2x -7 + 7 &lt; 35 + 7$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$- 8 &lt; -2x &lt; 42$</div>

<p>Now divide each part by -2 (and remember to change the direction of the inequality symbol!):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\displaystyle \frac{-8}{-2} &gt; \frac{-2x}{-2} &gt; \frac{42}{-2}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$4 &gt; x &gt; -21 $</div>

<p>Finally, it is customary (though not necessary) to write the inequality so that the inequality arrows point to the left (i.e., so that the numbers proceed from smallest to largest):</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$-21 &lt; x &lt; 4$</div>


<h3 id='concept_141'>2.3.4. Inequalities with Absolute Value</h3>

<blockquote>Inequalities with absolute values can be solved by thinking about absolute value as a number's distance from 0 on the number line.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Solve inequalities with absolute value</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Problems involving absolute values and inequalities can be approached in at least two ways: through trial and error, or by thinking of absolute value as representing distance from 0 and then finding the values that satisfy that condition.</li>
<li>When solving inequalities that involve an an absolute value within a larger expression (for example, <span class='clFormula'>$\left|2x\right| + 3&gt;8$</span>
), it is necessary to algebraically isolate the absolute value and then algebraically solve for the variable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dl>
<dt>absolute value</dt>
<dd>The magnitude of a real number without regard to its sign; formally, -1 times a number if the number is negative, and a number unmodified if it is zero or positive.</dd>
<dt>inequality</dt>
<dd>A statement that of two quantities one is specifically less than or greater than another.</dd>
<dt>number line</dt>
<dd>A line that graphically represents the real numbers as a series of points whose distance from an origin is proportional to their value.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Consider the following inequality that includes an absolute value:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$|x| &lt; 10$</div>

<p>Knowing that the solution to <span class='clFormula'>$\left|x\right|=10$</span>
is <span class='clFormula'>$x =  10$</span>
, many students answer this question <span class='clFormula'>$x &lt;  10$</span>
. However, this is wrong.</p>
<p>Here are two different, but both perfectly correct, ways to look at this problem.</p>

<h3>Trial and Error</h3>

<p>What numbers work? That is to say, for what numbers is <span class='clFormula'>$\left|x\right| &lt; 10$</span>
a true statement? Let's test some out. </p>
<p>4 works. -4 does too. 13 doesn't work. How about -13? No: If <span class='clFormula'>$x = -13$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$\left|x\right| = 13$</span>
, which is not less than 10. </p>
<p>By playing with numbers in this way, you should be able to convince yourself that the numbers that work must be somewhere between -10 and 10. This is one way to approach finding the answer.</p>

<h3>Absolute Value as Distance</h3>

<p>The other way is to think of absolute value as representing distance from 0. <span class='clFormula'>$\left|5\right|$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$\left|-5\right|$</span>
are both 5 because both numbers are 5 away from 0. </p>
<p>In this case, <span class='clFormula'>$\left|x\right| &lt; 10$</span>
means "the distance between <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and 0 is less than 10." In other words, you are within 10 units of zero in either direction. Once again, we conclude that the answer must be between -10 and 10.</p>
<p>This answer can be visualized on the number line as shown below, in which all numbers whose absolute value is less than 10 are highlighted.</p>



<a href='../images/0211.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0211.png' alt='Solution to '></a>

<div><b><i>Solution to <span class='clFormula'>$\left|x\right| &lt; 10$</span></i></b></div>
<p>All numbers whose absolute value is less than 10.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use both of these methods; use whichever method is easier for you to understand.</p>

<h3>Solving Inequalities with Absolute Value</h3>

<p>More complicated absolute value problems should be approached in the same way as  equations with absolute values: algebraically isolate the absolute value, and then algebraically solve for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example, consider the following inequality:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$\left|2x\right| + 3&gt;8$</span></p>
<p>It is difficult to immediately visualize the meaning of this absolute value, let alone the value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
itself. It is necessary to first isolate the inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \left|2x\right| + 3 - 3 &amp;&gt; 8 - 3 \\ \left|2x\right| &amp;&gt; 8 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now think about the number line. In those terms, this statement means that the expression <span class='clFormula'>$2x$</span>
must be more than 8 places away
from 0. Therefore, it must be either greater than 8 or less than -8.
Expressing this with inequalities, we have:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$2x&gt;8$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$2x &lt; -8$</span></p>
<p>We now have 2 separate inequalities. If each one is separately solved for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, we will see the full range of possible values of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. Consider them independently. First:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 2x &amp;&gt;8 \\ \dfrac{2x}{2} &amp;&gt; \dfrac{8}{2} \\ x &amp;&gt; 4 \end{align} $</div>

<p>Second:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 2x &amp;&lt; -8 \\ \dfrac{2x}{2} &amp;&lt; \dfrac{-8}{2} \\ x &amp;&lt; -4 \end{align}$</div>

<p>We now have two ranges of solutions to the original absolute value inequality: </p>
<p><span class='clFormula'>$x &gt; 4$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$x &lt; -4$</span></p>
<p>This can also be visually displayed on a number line: </p>



<a href='../images/0212.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0212.png' alt='Solution to '></a>

<div><b><i>Solution to <span class='clFormula'>$\left|2x\right| + 3&gt;8$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The solution is any value of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
less than -4 or greater than 4.</p>


<h3>Example </h3>

<p>Solve the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\left|x-2\right| + 10 &gt; 7$</div>

<p>First, algebraically isolate the absolute value:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} \left|x-2\right| + 10 - 10 &amp;&gt; 7 - 10 \\ \left|x-2\right| &amp;&gt; - 3 \end{align}$</div>

<p> Now think: the absolute value of the expression is greater than –3. What could the expression be equal to? 2 works. –2 also works. And 0. And 7. And –10. Absolute values are always positive, so the absolute value of anything is greater than –3! All numbers therefore work.</p>

<h3>
</h3>

<p>Named for "the father of analytic geometry," 17th-century French mathematician René Descartes, the Cartesian coordinate system is a 2-dimensional plane with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. Both axes extend to infinity, and arrows are used to indicate infinite length. The horizontal axis is known as the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, and the vertical axis is known as the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis. The point where the axes intersect is known as the origin.</p>
<p>A Cartesian coordinate system is used to graph points. Points are specified uniquely in the Cartesian plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to the two axes. Each point can be represented by an ordered pair <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)&#10;$</span>
, where the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-coordinate is the point's distance from the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis and the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-coordinate is the distance from the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis. The origin where the two axes meet is therefore <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
. On the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis, numbers increase toward the right and decrease toward the left; on the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, numbers increase going upward and decrease going downward.
</p>

<div><b><i>Cartesian coordinate system</i></b></div>
<p>The Cartesian coordinate system with 4 points plotted, including the origin, at <span class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</span>
.</p>


<h3>Plotting Points</h3>

<p>To plot the point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,3)$</span>
, for example, you start at the origin (where the two axes intersect). Then, move
three units to the right and two units up. </p>
<p> The point <span class='clFormula'>$(-3,1)$</span>
 is found by moving three units to the left of the origin and one unit up.</p>
<p>The non-integer coordinates <span class='clFormula'>$(-1.5,-2.5)$</span>
lie between -1 and -2 on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis and between -2 and -3 on the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis. Therefore, you move one and a half units left and two and a half units down.</p>

<h3>Independent and Dependent Variables  </h3>

<p>A Cartesian plane is particularly useful for plotting   a series of points that show a relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>For example, there is a relationship between the number of cars a car wash cleans and the money the business makes (its revenue). The revenue, or output, depends upon the number of cars, or input, that they wash. Therefore, the revenue is the dependent variable (<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
), and the number of cars is the independent variable (<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
).  The revenue is plotted on the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis, and the number of cars washed is plotted on the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis.</p>

<h3>Quadrants </h3>

<p>The Cartesian coordinate system is broken into four quadrants by the two axes. These quadrants are labeled I, II, III, and IV, starting from the upper right and continuing counter-clockwise, as pictured below.</p>



<a href='../images/0214.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0214.png' alt='Cartesian coordinates'></a>

<div><b><i>Cartesian coordinates</i></b></div>
<p>The four quadrants of theCartesian coordinate system. The arrows on the axes indicate that they extend infinitely in their respective directions.</p>

<p>Some basic rules about these quadrants can be helpful for quickly plotting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quadrant I: Points have positive <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates, <span class='clFormula'>$(x,y)$</span>
.</li>
<li>Quadrant II: Points have negative <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and positive <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates, <span class='clFormula'>$(-x,y)$</span>
.</li>
<li>Quadrant III: Points have negative <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates, <span class='clFormula'>$(-x,-y)$</span>
.</li>
<li>Quadrant IV: Points have positive <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and negative <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
coordinates, <span class='clFormula'>$(x,-y)$</span>
.</li>
<li>Points that have a value of 0 for either coordinate lie on the axes themselves and are not considered to be in any of the quadrants (e.g., <span class='clFormula'>$(4,0)$</span>
,  <span class='clFormula'>$(0,-2)$</span>
).</li>

, which correspond to Cartesian coordinates. </p>
<p>Equations in two variables have not one solution but a series of solutions that will satisfy the equation for both variables. Each solution is an ordered pair and can be written in the form <span class='clFormula'>$(x, y)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Solving Equations in Two Variables</h3>

<p>For a given equation in two variables, choosing a value for one variable dictates what the value of the other variable will be. In other words, if a value for one variable is provided, then a solution can be found that satisfies the equation. This is accomplished by substituting the given value in for that variable, and solving for the value of the other.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Consider the following equation: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = 2x$</div>

<p> This is an equation in two variables that has an infinite number of solutions. For any  <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value, the corresponding <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value will be twice its value. </p>
<p>For example, <span class='clFormula'>$(1, 2)$</span>
is a solution to the equation. This can be verified by plugging in the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
- and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(2) = 2(1)$</div>

<p>Another solution is <span class='clFormula'>$(30, 60)$</span>
, because <span class='clFormula'>$(60) = 2(30)$</span>
. There are thus an infinite number of ordered pairs that satisfy the equation.<span class='clFormula'>$$</span></p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Now consider the following equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = 2x + 4$</div>

<p> Is the point <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 10)$</span>
a solution to this equation?</p>
<p>Note that the ordered pair <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 10)$</span>
tells us that <span class='clFormula'>$x = 3$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$y = 10$</span>
. To evaluate whether this is a solution to the equation, substitute these values in for the variables as follows:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$(10) = 2(3) + 4$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$10 = 6 + 4$</div>

<p>This is a true statement, so <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 10)$</span>
is indeed a solution to this equation.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<p>Solve the equation <span class='clFormula'>$y = 4x - 7$</span>
for the value <span class='clFormula'>$x=3$</span>
.</p>
<p>The solution to the given equation would take the form <span class='clFormula'>$(x, y)$</span>
, and we are given the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value. The <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value can be substituted into the equation to find the value of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
at this point:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = 4(3) - 7$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = 12 - 7$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = 5$</div>

<p>For the given equation, <span class='clFormula'>$y = 5$</span>
when <span class='clFormula'>$x = 3$</span>
. Therefore, the solution is <span class='clFormula'>$(3, 5)$</span>
.</p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>

<p>Solve <span class='clFormula'>$x + 2y = 8$</span>
for <span class='clFormula'>$x = 4$</span>
.</p>
<p>As in the above example, the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value is provided, and we need to find the corresponding <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-value. We can first rewrite the equation in terms of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x + 2y -x = 8 -x$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$2y = 8 - x$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$\dfrac{2y}{2} = \dfrac{8-x}{2}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = \dfrac{8}{2} - \dfrac{x}{2}$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = 4 - \dfrac{1}{2} x$</div>

<p>Now substitute <span class='clFormula'>$x = 4$</span>
into the equation, and solve for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y = 4 - \dfrac{1}{2}(4)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = 4 - 2$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$y = 2$</div>

<p>The solution is <span class='clFormula'>$(4, 2)$</span>
.</p>

<h3 id='concept_95'>2.4.3. Graphing Equations</h3>

<blockquote>Equations and their relationships can be visualized in many different types of graphs.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice graphing equations in the Cartesian plane</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>Graphs are important tools for visualizing equations.</li>
<li>To graph an equation, choose a value for either <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, solve for the variable you didn't choose, plot the ordered pair as a point on the Cartesian plane, and repeat, until you have enough points plotted that you can connect them  to  visualize the graph.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Terms</h4>

<dt>graph</dt>
<dd>A diagram displaying data; in particular, one showing the relationship between two or more quantities, measurements or numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Now that we know what equations are, how do we go about visualizing them? For an equation with two variables,
<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, we need a graph with two axes: an
<span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis and a <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis. We will use the Cartesian plane, in which the <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-axis
is a horizontal line and the
<span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis is a vertical line. Where the two axes cross is called the origin.</p>

<h3>Graphing an Equation in Two Variables</h3>

<p>Let's start with the following equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y=2x-3$</div>

<p>We'll start by choosing a few <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values, plugging them into this equation, and solving for the unknown variable <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
. After creating a few <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
and  <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 ordered pairs, we will plot them on the Cartesian plane and connect the points.</p>
<p>For the three values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, let's choose a negative number, zero, and a positive number so we include points on both sides of the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-axis:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$x=-2$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=-7$</span>
. We plot the point <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,-7)$</span>
.</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=-3$</span>
. We plot the point  <span class='clFormula'>$(0,-3)$</span>
.</li>
<li>If <span class='clFormula'>$x=2$</span>
, then <span class='clFormula'>$y=1$</span>
. We plot the point <span class='clFormula'>$(2,1)$</span>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can connect the dots to visualize the graph of the equation:</p>



<a href='../images/0215.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0215.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=2x-3$</span></i></b></div>
<p>The equation is the graph of a line through the three points found above. The line continues on to infinity in each direction, since there is an infinite series of ordered pairs of solutions.</p>


<h3>Graphing Non-Linear Equations</h3>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>What graph will the following equation make?</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$x^{2}+y^{2} = 100$</div>

<p>Let's figure it out by choosing some points to plot.</p>
<p>First, let's try <span class='clFormula'>$x=0$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} (0)^{2}+y^{2} &amp;= 100 \\ y^{2} &amp;= 100 \\ \sqrt{y^{2}}&amp;=\sqrt{100} \\ y &amp;= \pm10 \end{align}$</div>

<p>So we plot <span class='clFormula'>$(0,10)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(0,-10)$</span>
. </p>
<p>Note that we don't always have to choose values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. For example, let's now try setting <span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
. </p>
<p>Through the same arithmetic as above,  we get the ordered pairs <span class='clFormula'>$(10,0)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(-10,0)$</span>
. Plot these as well.</p>
<p>We still don't have enough points to really see what's going on, so let's choose some more. Let's try solving for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 when <span class='clFormula'>$x=6$</span>
:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} (6)^2+y^2&amp;=100 \\ 36+y^2&amp;=100 \\ 36+y^2-36&amp;=100-36 \\ y^2&amp;=64 \\ y&amp;=\pm 8 \end{align}$</div>

<p>So that's two new points: <span class='clFormula'>$(6,8)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(6,-8)$</span>
. We get similar results with <span class='clFormula'>$x=-6$</span>
, to get <span class='clFormula'>$(-6,8)$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$(-6,-8)$</span>
.  </p>
<p>Now you can begin seeing that  we're drawing a circle with a radius of 10:</p>



<a href='../images/0216.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0216.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$x^2+y^2=100$</span></i></b></div>
<p>This is a graph of a circle with radius 10 and center at the origin.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Let's try another example. This time let's use the following equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$ y=-x^{2}+9$</div>

<p>Again, let's plug in some numbers and begin plotting points.</p>
<p>Input values (for the independent variable <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
) from -2 to 2 can be used to obtain output values (the dependent variable <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
) from 5 to 9.  Connect these points with the best curve you can, and you'll discover you've drawn a parabola.</p>



<a href='../images/0217.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0217.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=-x^2+9$</span></i></b></div>
<p>This graph is of a parabola (a U-shaped open curve symmetric about a line). Parabolas can open up or down, right or left; they also have a maximum or minimum value.</p>

<p>In mathematics, to solve an equation is to find what values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) fulfill a condition stated in the form of an equation (two expressions related by equality). Each of the expressions contain one or more unknowns.</p>
<p>What is the graphical difference between equations with one variable and equations with two variables?</p>

<h3>Graphs of Linear Equations with One Variable</h3>



<p>A linear equation in one variable can be written in the form <span class='clFormula'>$ax+b=0, $</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$a$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$b$</span>
are real numbers and <span class='clFormula'>$a\neq 0$</span>
. In an equation where <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
is a real number, the graph is the collection of all ordered pairs with any value of <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
 paired with that real number for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
. </p>
<p>For example, to graph the equation <span class='clFormula'>$x-1=0, $</span>
 a few of the ordered pairs would include:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(1,-3)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,-2)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,-1)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,0)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,1)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,2)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,3)$</div>

</ul>
<p>These can also be found by solving the equation of the graph for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
, which yields <span class='clFormula'>$ x = 1$</span>
. This means that the <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values of the points don't matter as long as their <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values are 1. The graph is therefore a vertical line through those points, since all points have the same <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-value.</p>
<p>The same is true for an equation written as <span class='clFormula'>$ay+b=0$</span>
, or <span class='clFormula'>$y=-4$</span>
, for example. The graph would be a horizontal line through points that all have <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
-values of -4. </p>
<p>Therefore, when the equation is <span class='clFormula'>$y=C, $</span>
 where <span class='clFormula'>$C$</span>
is a constant real number, the graph is a horizontal line. Similarly, if the equation is <span class='clFormula'>$x=C,$</span>
 then the graph is a vertical line.</p>

<h3>Graphs of Equations with Two Variables</h3>

<p>The graph of a cubic polynomial has an equation like <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^3-9x$</span>
.  Its equation has two variables, <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 and <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
, and the equation is solved for <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
.</p>
<p>Plot specific points by substituting chosen <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
-values into the equation, and solve for the  corresponding <span class='clFormula'>$y$</span>
value, and then graph.</p>
<p>Let's choose values for <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 from -2 to 2. When <span class='clFormula'>$x=-2$</span>
, we have: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y=(-2)^3-9(-2)=(-8)+18=10$</div>

<p>Therefore, <span class='clFormula'>$(-2,10)$</span>
 is a point on this curve (i.e., the graph of the equation).</p>
<p>After substituting the rest of the values, the following ordered pairs are found:</p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$(-1,8)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(0,0)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(1,-8)$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$(2,-10)$</div>

</ul>
<p>After graphing the ordered pairs and connecting the points, we see that the set of (infinite) points follows this pattern:</p>



<a href='../images/0218.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0218.png' alt='Graph of '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y=x^3-9x$</span></i></b></div>
<p>Since the exponent of <span class='clFormula'>$x$</span>
 is a 3, it means that this equation is a 3rd-degree polynomial, called a cubic polynomial.</p>

<h3 id='concept_376'>2.4.5. Graphing Inequalities</h3>

<blockquote>The solutions to inequalities can be graphed by drawing a boundary line to divide the coordinate plane in two and shading in one of those parts.</blockquote>

<h4>Learning Objective</h4>

<p>Practice graphing inequalities by shading in the correct section of the plane</p>

<h4>Key Points</h4>

<ul>
<li>All solutions to a given inequality are located in one half-plane and can be graphed.</li>
<li>To graph an inequality, first treat it as a linear equation and graph the corresponding line. Then, shade the correct half-plane to represent all the possible solutions to the inequality.</li>
<li>If an inequality uses a <span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
 symbol,  the boundary line should be drawn solid, meaning that solutions include points on the line itself.</li>
<li>If an inequality uses a <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
 symbol, the boundary line should be drawn dotted, meaning that solutions do not include any points on the line.</li>
</ul>

</dl>



<p>In our study of linear equations in two variables, we observed that all
the solutions to an equation—and<em> only</em> those solutions—
were located on the graph of that equation. We now wish to determine the
location of the solutions to linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>
Linear inequalities in two variables have one of the following forms: </p>
<ul>

<div class='clFormula'>$ac + by &lt; c$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$ac + by \leq c$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$ac + by &gt; c$</div>


<div class='clFormula'>$ac + by \geq c$</div>

</ul>




<p>Recall that for a linear equation in two variables, ordered pairs that produce true statements when
substituted into the equation are called "solutions" to that equation.</p>
<p>We
can make a similar statement regarding inequalities in two variables. We say
that an inequality in two variables has a solution when a pair of values
has been found such that substituting these values into the
inequality results in a true statement.</p>
<p>As with equations, solutions to linear inequalities have particular
locations in the coordinate plane. For a linear equality in two variables, all solutions are located in one entire half-plane. A straight line drawn through the plane divides the plane into two half-planes, as shown in the diagram below. The straight line shown is called a boundary line.</p>



<a href='../images/0219.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0219.png' alt='Half-planes'></a>

<div><b><i>Half-planes</i></b></div>
<p>The boundary line shown above divides the coordinate plane into two half-planes.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following inequality:</p>
<p> <span class='clFormula'>$2x + 3y \leq 6&#10;$</span></p>
<p> The  graph below demonstrates all solutions to this inequality, which fall on the boundary line and in the shaded half-plane.</p>

<p>Now consider the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$y &gt; 2$</div>

<p> The graph below shows the solutions to this inequality: the shaded area above the boundary line. Note that because the inequality uses the <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
 symbol, rather than the <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
 symbol, the inequality is strict: points on the boundary line are not solutions, so the line is drawn dotted.</p>

<div><b><i>Graph of <span class='clFormula'>$y &gt; 2$</span></i></b></div>
<p>All points in the shaded half-plane above the line are solutions to this inequality.</p>

<p>The method of graphing linear inequalities in two variables is as follows.</p>
<p>First, consider the inequality as an equation (i.e., replace the inequality sign with an equals sign) and graph that equation. This is called the boundary line. Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the inequality is <span class='clFormula'>$\leq$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
, draw the boundary line solid. This means that points on the line are solutions and are part of the graph.	</li>
<li>If the inequality is <span class='clFormula'>$&lt;$</span>
or <span class='clFormula'>$&gt;$</span>
, draw the boundary line dotted. This means that points on the line are not solutions and are not part of the graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine which half-plane to shade by choosing a test point.</p>
<ul>
<li>If, when substituted, the test point yields a true statement, shade the half-plane containing it.</li>
<li>	If, when substituted, the test point yields a false statement, shade the half-plane on the opposite side of the boundary line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Graph the following inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x - 2y \geq -4$</div>

<p>First, we need to graph the boundary line. To do so, consider the inequality as an equation:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$3x-2y=-4$</div>

<p>Recall that, in order to graph an equation, we can substitute a value for one variable and solve for the other. The resulting ordered pair will be one solution to the equation. So, let's substitute <span class='clFormula'>$x = 0 $</span>
to find one solution: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3(0) - 2y &amp;= -4 \\ - 2y &amp;= -4 \\ \dfrac{-2y}{-2} &amp;= \dfrac{-4}{-2} \\ y &amp;= 2 \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now let's substitute <span class='clFormula'>$y=0$</span>
to find another solution: </p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3x - 2(0) &amp;= - 4 \\ 3x &amp;= -4 \\ \dfrac{3x}{3} &amp;= \dfrac{-4}{3} \\ x &amp;= - \dfrac{4}{3} \end{align}$</div>

<p>Now we can graph the two known solutions, <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 2)$</span>
and <span class='clFormula'>$(-\frac{4}{3}, 0)$</span>
. The inequality is <span class='clFormula'>$\geq$</span>
, so we know we need to draw the line solid. This gives the boundary line below:</p>



<a href='../images/0222.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/0222.png' alt='Graph of boundary line for '></a>

<div><b><i>Graph of boundary line for <span class='clFormula'>$3x - 2y \geq -4$</span></i></b></div>
<p>Graph of the boundary line, drawn using two ordered-pair solutions.</p>

<p>Next, choose a test point to figure out which half-plane we need to shade in. The easiest test point is <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 0)$</span>
. Let's substitute <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 0)$</span>
into the original inequality:</p>

<div class='clFormula'>$\begin{align} 3(0) - 2(0) &amp;\geq -4 \\ 0 &amp;\geq -4 \end{align}$</div>

<p>This a true statement, so shade in the half-plane containing <span class='clFormula'>$(0, 0). $</span></p>
