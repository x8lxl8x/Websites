# Rules

### Setup
[-
Tiles are shuffled face down on the table.
Each player will create a wall of tiles in front of them, 17 wide and 2 high, face down
Roll dice to determine who goes first
Highest roll becomes the East wind, then going to South, West, and North counterclockwise
Turn order is counterclockwise starting from East
The starting wind is East, and the indicator is given to the East seat
The East seat rolls the dice to determine which wall to break first, beginning with the next wall
From the left of the wall from the perspective of the wall's builder,
count the dice-roll-number of tiles from the left and break from there
Each player will take 4 tiles at a time until everyone has 12 tiles
All tiles drawn are then set upright in front of the player, forming their hand
The East player will then draw a tile from the wall and then skip over one tile and take a 14th tile
The remaining players will then draw their 13th tile in order
The East player then discards a tile to the center of the table, face up, and the game begins
-]

### Turns
[-
A turn in Mahjong consists of drawing a tile from the wall (in the order the tiles were dealt)
The player will then choose a tile in his/her hand to discard into the middle of the table, face up
If a discarded tile can be used by another player to complete a pung:
That other player can call 'pung' and take the tile and use it to complete the pung
The tiles used in the pung are then placed in front of the player, face up
The stealing player then discards a tile, and play resumes from the stealing player's position
Some players' turns may be skipped because of this
If a discarded tile can be used by another player to complete a chi:
The discarded tile can only be taken if it was discarded by the player to the left
That is, chi tiles can only be taken from the preceding player in turn order
The tiles used in the chi are then placed in front of the player, face up
If 'chi' and 'pung' is called on the same discard, then 'pung' has precedence
If 'chi' is called by multiple players on the same tile, then the first to do so wins
-]

### Reveals

The only time tiles are laid in front of a player is if that player steals a discard from another player
[-
If a pung or chi is self-drawn from the wall, they do not need to reveal their tiles
Therefore, it is possible to steal a tile as a 'kong', which works similarly to calling 'pung'
-]

When taking a tile to complete a 'kong', an extra tile is drawn from the back of the wall
[-
A tile is then discarded as normal
-]

If a player has laid a pung of tiles in front of them and then draws the 4th:
[-
That player can choose to complete the kong and draw another tile form the back of the wall
This action can occur at any time, but only if the tile was self drawn
-]

If a flower/season tile is ever drawn, it is immediately placed in front of the player who drew it
[-
A replacement tile from the back of the wall is then drawn, and play continues as normal
Flowers and seasons are used for bonus points, more on scoring later
