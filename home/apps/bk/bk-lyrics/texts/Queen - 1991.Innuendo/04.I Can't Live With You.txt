I can't live without you, I can't live without you, I can't live without you, I can't live without you
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, wow, oh
Hey

Yeah, I can't live with you
But I can't live without you (oooh-oooh-ooh)
I can't let you stay, oooh
But I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes (ooooh)
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems

Love is saying baby it's alright
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

I can't live with you, yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away (ooooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake

We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's alright
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do, yeah

I can't live with you
I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live, I can't, I can't live with you
But baby, I'll never ever leave you (ooooh-ooooh)

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
'Cos I'm in love with you, ooh
And everything about you (ooooh-oooh-ooh)

I can't live with you
No, I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you, yeah
But I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other for a million years
Yeah

Oooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, day-dap
I can't live without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Wow oh, I can't live without you, baby, baby, baby

Without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
A-bop, a-bop, a-woah-woah-woah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't live without you
Yeah
