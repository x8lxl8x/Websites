One, two, three, four

Oooh, oooh

While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till mountains crumble into the plane
Ooh, yes we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Ooh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time

Oooh, oooh

While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Ooh yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
We'll tread that fine line
Ooh, oh, we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your evil, be free, be free to yourself

Oooh, oooh
Yeah
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die, ha
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask

Ooh, yes we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And whatever will be, will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
