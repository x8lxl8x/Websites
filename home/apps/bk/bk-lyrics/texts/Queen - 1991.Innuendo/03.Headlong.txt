And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do, no there's nothing you can do about it
No there's nothing you can, nothing you can, nothing you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothing
You can do about it, yeah

Hey, he used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop, diddy, diddy, hoop, diddy, do
She used to be a woman with a hotdog stand
Hoop, diddy, diddy, wow, hoop, diddy, do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're getting in a fight then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night let me out of this cheap B movie

Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rocking
And there's nothing you can, nothing you can, nothing you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop, diddy, diddy, hoop, diddy, do, ho
Soon the fire starts a raging gets them more than half crazy
Hoop, diddy, diddy, hoop, diddy, do
Ooh, now they start freaking every way you turn
You can't start walking 'cos your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
'Cos reason's out the window
Better hold on tight

You're rushing headlong
Headlong out of control, yeah
You think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you, nothing you
Nothing you can do about it at all

Yeah, yeah
Alright, go

And you're rushing headlong down the highway
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing, nothing you can do about it, yeah
(Oooh, oooh, ooh-ooh-oooh)

Ha, ha, headlong
Headlong
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Headlong, headlong
Headlong, on and on and on and on and
