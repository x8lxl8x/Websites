Ride the wild wind
Push the envelope, don't sit on the fence - hey, hey, hey, hey
Ride the wild wind
Live your life on the razors edge - hey, hey, hey
Gonna ride the wild wind, ooooh
It ain't dangerous enough for me

Get your head down baby, yeah, we're gonna ride tonight
Your angel eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand, lead you from this place
Gonna leave it all behind, check out of this rat race

Ride the wild wind - hey, hey, hey, hey
Ride the wild wind - hey (hey, hey, hey)
Gonna ride the wild wind (ooooh)
It ain't dangerous enough for me

Tie your hair back baby
We're gonna ride tonight, yeah
We got freaks to the left
We got jerks to the right
Sometimes I get so low
I just have to ride
Um, let me take your hand
Um, let me be your guide

Ooh, ride the wild wind
Don't sit on the fence - hey, hey, hey, hey
Um, ride the wild wind
Live life on the razors edge - (hey, hey, hey)
Gonna ride the wild wind (ooooh)
It ain't dangerous enough for me

Yeah, ride the wild wind - hey, hey, hey, hey
Um, ride the wild wind - hey, hey, hey, hey, ha, ha, ha
Gonna ride it, ride the wild wind
It ain't dangerous enough for me

Ride the wild wind
Ride the wild wind (hey, hey, hey)

Ride the wild wind (hey, hey, hey)
Ride the wild wind
(Hey, hey, hey)

(Hey, hey, hey)
