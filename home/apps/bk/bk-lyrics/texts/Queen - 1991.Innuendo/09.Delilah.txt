Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're irresistible, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite
That's alright

Delilah
Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're unpredictable, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite
(Ooooh, ooooh)
Delilah
(Ooooh, ooooh)
Delilah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, oh
You're the apple of my eyes
Miaow
Miaow
Miaow
Delilah - I love you
Delilah, oh

Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses and I go out of my mind, wooh
You're irresistible, I love you Delilah
Delilah - I love you

Ha, ha, you make me very happy, oooh, oooh, oh yes
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses
