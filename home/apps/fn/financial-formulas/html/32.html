<p>The Annual Percentage Yield (APY), referenced as the effective annual rate in Finance, is the rate of interest that is earned when taking into consideration the effect of compounding.</p>
<p>There are various terms used when compounding is not considered including nominal interest rate, stated annual interest rate, and annual percentage rate(APR).</p>
<p>In the formula, the stated interest rate is shown as <b>r</b>. A bank may show this as simply &quot;interest rate&quot;. The annual percentage yield formula would be applied to determine what the effective yield would be if the account was compounded given the stated rate. The <b>n</b> in the annual percentage yield formula would be the number of times that the financial institution compounds. For example, if a financial institution compounds the account monthly, <b>n</b> would equal 12.</p>

<h2>Example of Annual Percentage Yield</h2>
<p>An account states that its rate is 6% compounded monthly. The rate, or  <b><i>r</i></b> , would be .06, and the number of times compounded would be 12 as there are 12 months in a year. When we put this into the formula we have</p>
