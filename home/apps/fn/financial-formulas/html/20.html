<h1>Future Value of Growing Annuity</h1>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Growing%20Annuity%20-%20FV%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The formula for the future value of a growing annuity is used to calculate the future amount of a series of cash flows, or payments, that grow at a proportionate rate. A growing annuity may sometimes be referred to as an increasing annuity.</p>

<h2>Example of FV of Growing Annuity</h2>
<p>An example of the future value of a growing annuity formula would be an individual who is paid biweekly and decides to save one of her extra paychecks per year. One of her net paychecks amounts to $2,000 for the first year and she expects to receive a 5% raise on her net pay every year. For this example, we will use 5% on her net pay and not involve taxes and other adjustments in order to hold all other things constant. In an account that has a yield of 3% per year, she would like to calculate her savings balance after 5 years.</p>
<p>The growth rate in this example would be the 5% increase per year, the initial cash flow or payment would be $2,000, the number of periods would be 5 years, and rate per period would be 3%. Using these variables in the future value of growing annuity formula would show</p>

<p>After solving this equation, the amount after the 5th cash flow would be $11,700.75.</p>

<h2>How is the FV of Growing Annuity Derived?</h2>
<p>The future value of a growing annuity formula can be found by first looking at the following present value of a growing annuity formula</p>

<p>Present Value can be converted into future value by multiplying the present value times  <b><i>(1+r)<sup>n</sup></i></b> . By multiplying the 2nd portion of the PV of growing annuity formula above by  <b><i>(1+r)<sup>n</sup></i></b> , the formula would show as</p>

<p>From here, the formula above is the same as the formula shown at the top of the page after factoring out the initial payment,  <b><i>P</i></b> .</p>
