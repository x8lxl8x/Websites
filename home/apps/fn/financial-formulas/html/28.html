<h1>PV - Continuous Compounding</h1>

<p>The present value with continuous compounding formula is used to calculate the current value of a future amount that has earned at a continuously compounded rate. There are 3 concepts to consider in the present value with continuous compounding formula: time value of money, present value, and continuous compounding.</p>

<h2>Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Continuous Compounding</h2>
<p><b><i>Time Value of Money</i></b>  - The present value with continuous compounding formula relies on the concept of time value of money. Time value of money is the idea that a specific amount today is worth more than the same amount at a future date. For example, if one were to be offered $1,000 today or $1,000 in 5 years, the presumption is that today would be preferable.</p>
<p><b><i>Present Value</i></b>  - The basic premise of present value is the time value of money. To expand upon the prior example, if one were to be offered $1,000 today or $1,250 in 5 years, the answer would not be as obvious as the prior example where both amounts were equal. This is where present value comes in. The offeree would need a way to determine today's value of the future amount of $1,250 to compare the two options.</p>
<p><b><i>Continuous Compounding</i></b>  - Continuous Compounding is essentially compounding that is constant. Ordinary compounding will have a compound basis such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and so forth. However, continuous compounding is nonstop, effectively having an infinite amount of compounding for a given time.</p>
<p>The present value with continuous compounding formula uses the last 2 of these concepts for its actual calculations. The cash flow is discounted by the continuously compounded rate factor.</p>

<h2>Example of the Present Value with Continuous Compounding Formula</h2>
<p>An example of the present value with continuous compounding formula would be an individual who in two years would like to have $1100 in an interest account that is providing an 8% continuously compounded return. To solve for the current amount needed in the account to achieve this balance in two years, the variables are $1,100 is FV, 8% is r, and 2 years is t. The equation for this example would be</p>

<p>This would return a result of $937.36.</p>
