<h1>Delta Gamma</h1>

<p>The single most important concept in option trading
is that of delta and gamma.&nbsp; Investors not aware of
these terms or concepts are setting themselves up for a
disappointing trade.&nbsp; Understanding these advanced
option terms will improve your investment results
immediately!</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple trading question:</p>
<p><b>You are bullish on XYZ stock and want to invest in
options.&nbsp; Which of the following do you do?</b></p>
<p>A) Buy calls<br>
B) Buy puts<br>
C) Sell calls<br>
D) Sell puts</p>
<p>If you answered A, as most people do, you just set
yourself up for a potentially losing trade.&nbsp; And no, you
didn't misread the question; you just fell into the most
common error in option investing. </p>
<p>To really emphasize why so many people lose with
options, think about this: We never even got to the
point of <i>which</i> option to buy, yet have already
made a critical mistake.&nbsp; There was no discussion as to
whether we should buy a 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, or
even LEAPS option.&nbsp; There was no discussion as to which
strike.&nbsp; We just invested a lot of money and sent a
wounded horse to the starting gate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's find out what the mistake is and how to correct
it.</p>
<h2>Options have two components to their value</h2>
<p>Stocks, compared to options, are much easier to
trade.&nbsp; All you have to do is decide whether the stock
is going up or down.&nbsp; You only need to determine the <u>
direction</u>.&nbsp; Of course, anyone who has ever invested
in stocks knows that this, in itself, can be incredibly
difficult.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With options, there are two components to their value
-- <i>direction</i> and <i><u>speed</u></i>.&nbsp; It is this
second component, speed, that makes options such tricky
investments.&nbsp; Delta measures direction, and gamma
measures speed.&nbsp; Although there are specific numerical
measures of delta and gamma, we are only going to
consider them in a much simpler, conceptual format.</p>
<p>Delta, as mentioned, measures direction.&nbsp; A <u>long
call</u> position has positive delta; in other words,
the value of the call will go up (positive) as the price
of the underlying stock rises.&nbsp; Put options have
negative delta; their value will go down (negative) as
the price of the stock rises.&nbsp; Of course, the opposite
is also true.&nbsp; If the underlying stock goes down, calls
will lose and puts will gain in value.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What if we are short a call?&nbsp; Then our position will
have a negative delta meaning our position will lose
value as the stock rises.&nbsp; Similarly, if we are short a
put, then we have positive delta; our position will gain
in value as the stock rises.</p>
<p>It should be easy to see now that there are <u>two
ways</u> to obtain positive deltas; long calls and short
puts.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>KEY CONCEPT:If you are bullish on a stock, you
want positive delta for your option position.&nbsp; If
bearish, you want negative delta.</b></p>
<p>What about gamma?&nbsp; Gamma measures the speed component
of an option.&nbsp; In a conceptual sense, gamma can be
measured, as can any object with speed, with time.&nbsp; So
time premium is a way to determine gamma.&nbsp; The higher
the <u>time premium</u> of an option, the higher the
gamma.&nbsp; Because the time premium is the portion of the
option's price that erodes with the passage of time, it
is this portion that is exposed to slow or no movement
in the underlying stock.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Example:</b><br>
XYZ stock is trading for $50<p>XYZ $50 call
trading for $5<br>
XYZ $30 call trading for $21</p>
<p>Here, the $50 call is all time premium.&nbsp;
Therefore it will have a higher gamma
component.&nbsp; The $30 call has only $1 time
premium, so compared to the $50 call, its gamma
component will be much lower.&nbsp; Gamma can also be
thought of as a risk measure.&nbsp; We can say the
$50 call is riskier, in terms of speed, than the
$30 call,&nbsp; because if the stock sits still, the
$30 call can only lose $1 (3.23% of value),
while the $50 call can lose the entire $5 (100%
of value).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Another way to look at the risk factor is in terms of
break-even points.&nbsp; The $30 call will need to have the
stock trading at $51 by expiration in order to break
even.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If the stock is $51, the call will be worth
exactly $21, the price paid for the option.&nbsp; However,
the $50 call must have the stock trading at $55 to break
even.&nbsp; So again, the $30 call, with respect to speed, is
less risky.&nbsp; In other words, the $30 call does not need
as much movement in the stock to break even as compared
to the $50 call. </p>
<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, <u>long</u>
calls and <u>long</u> puts both have positive gamma.&nbsp;
This is because you need speed in the underlying stock
if you have a long position; you need to make up for the
time premium you paid. </p>
<p><b>KEY CONCEPT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are looking for quick
speed of movement in the underlying stock, your option
position should have positive gamma.&nbsp; If you expect the
stock to move slowly or sit flat, your option position
should have zero gamma or even negative gamma.&nbsp; </b></p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Example</b><p>We are bullish on XYZ
trading at $100</p>
<p>1-month $105 call is trading at $7</p>
<p>1-month $95 put is trading at $5</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We determined at the beginning of this lesson, that
most investors would be inclined to buy calls because we
are bullish.&nbsp; So let's buy a call and see what happens!</p>
<p>We are long the $105 call at $7.&nbsp; At expiration, the
stock is trading at $110.&nbsp; The question now is, are we
correct in our bullish assumption?&nbsp; There is no question
that we are.&nbsp; The stock is up a whopping 10% in a month
(that may not seem like a lot, but that's an annualized
rate of over 200% -- at that rate, you would more than
triple your money in a year).&nbsp; So just how much of a
killing did we make on our call?</p>
<p>The $105 call will be trading for $5, exactly the
intrinsic amount.&nbsp; We paid $7 and sold for $5, yet we
were correct in our bullish assumption.&nbsp; That's a 28%
loss on the investment for being correct!&nbsp; Sound
familiar?</p>
<p>Now that we know about deltas and gammas, let's see
if we can correct the mistake.&nbsp; This trader just made
the classic mistake of trading options only on delta --
the direction of the stock.&nbsp; Let's polish up the trade a
bit.</p>
<p>We know that the trader is bullish so we should have
positive delta -- either long calls or short puts.&nbsp; But
now let's say that we ask the trader, &quot;How quickly do
you think the stock will move?&quot;&nbsp; Let's say he says, &quot;I
think it will move up but slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>Now we are in position to set up a winning trade --
assuming the trader's assumptions are correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We now know he wants positive delta (because he's
bullish) but also needs negative gamma (because he
believes it will move slowly).&nbsp; The following chart
should help us determine what we should do:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table6'>
<tr>
<td v>&nbsp;</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Delta</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Gamma</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Long Calls</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>+</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>+</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Long Puts</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>-</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>+</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So how can we get positive delta and negative gamma?&nbsp;
We can <u>short the puts</u>, which will give us the
opposite signs as listed in the table above.&nbsp; Long puts
have negative delta and positive gamma, so a short
position will have positive delta and negative gamma --
<u>exactly what the trader needs</u>! </p>
<p>Now, if he shorts the $95 puts, he will receive $5
and keep the entire $5 instead of losing $2 as he did
with the calls.&nbsp; What if the trader doesn't want to be
short or doesn't have the option approval level to be
short?&nbsp; We could do a credit spread that would lessen
the risk.&nbsp; Or, we know he desires negative gamma but a
gamma close to zero would also work.&nbsp; Remember, time
premium is synonymous with gamma, so to get a gamma of
zero (or close to it), we could also look at
deep-in-the-money calls.</p>
<p>With XYZ at $100, the $80 call may be trading in the
neighborhood of $20-1/2 ($20 intrinsic + a small amount
of time premium).&nbsp; If he buys the $80 call he will spend
$20-1/2 and with the stock closing at $110. He will be
able to sell the option for $30 for a profit of $9-1/2
(46% gain), which is certainly better than the 28% loss
taken when he traded only on direction alone. </p>
<p>Now you should be in a position to fully answer the
question asked at the beginning.&nbsp; The correct way to
answer is this:&nbsp; We should have clarified the gamma
component with the investor; in other words, is the
investor bullish <u>quickly</u> or <u>slowly</u>.&nbsp; Once
we determine that, we can then recommend either long
calls or short puts, or a host of other strategies that
would properly align the deltas and gammas with his
directional opinion of the stock.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It should now be evident that there are TWO
components you need to determine when dealing in options
-- direction and speed.&nbsp; In order to make a profitable
trade, a position with positive gamma <u>must move up</u>;
a position with negative gamma does not have to move up,
it just <u>cannot move down</u>.&nbsp; These are two very
different situations.&nbsp; If you don't consider both, you
will almost certainly set yourself up for a losing
trade.</p>
