<h1>Hedging</h1>

<p>Did you hold your tech stocks last month hoping for
an upside bounce?&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; Are you now wishing you had
sold instead?&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; Well, now you can reap the benefits
of both.</p>
<p>Here's how...</p>
<p>Portfolio insurance is nothing new to
professional traders yet unknown to most retail
investors.&nbsp; Before you say, &quot;I don't need any
insurance,&quot; think about this:&nbsp; Many investors'
homes and cars are insured, yet valued less than
their stock portfolio.&nbsp; In addition, we have
recently seen some of the bluest of blue-chips
such as Proctor and Gamble, Home Depot, Eli
Lilly and Hewlett-Packard lose over twenty-five
percent of their value in a single day.&nbsp; Don't
think it can't happen to the tech stocks you
hold.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with portfolio
insurance, read on and find out how the
professionals take the emotions out of
investing.</p>

<p>It is often said that knowing when to sell is
the most difficult part of investing.&nbsp; This is
because of the two most significant factors that
drive the markets: greed and fear.&nbsp; When stocks
are flying, we hang on hoping for more.&nbsp; When
they fall, we sell the shares out of fear, often
forgetting about the long-term reasons we bought
them in the first place.&nbsp; We are afraid to take
profits yet quick to take losses, which is not a
very good formula for making money in the
markets!</p>
<p>Now, we are not advocating short-term trading.&nbsp; After
all, the stock market has a very long history of an
upward bias, and statistically speaking, you are better
off buying and holding.&nbsp; But the emotional side of the
investor rarely allows this strategy to work.&nbsp; The
roller coaster starts, your profits become losses, and
there you are selling at a loss again.&nbsp; Is there a
better way to trade?</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you may want to consider
portfolio insurance.&nbsp; Basically, portfolio insurance can
be defined as an added asset to your portfolio that will
increase in value as a particular stock or index falls
in value.&nbsp; Financial professionals call this a <i>hedge</i>,
and we will look at many ways to place a hedge in your
portfolio, some without any out-of-pocket expense!&nbsp; </p>
<p>To understand hedging, you need to understand some
basics of the options markets, as this is one of the
primary tools used for hedging.&nbsp; Options were created as
a way for investors to buy and sell risk, and while this
may seem unusual, it actually occurs in many ways in our
everyday lives.&nbsp; For example, driving a car involves the
risk of wrecks, injury, and theft.&nbsp; You do not want this
risk, but for a fee, your auto insurance company does.&nbsp;
You have, in fact, transferred the risk to them.&nbsp; When
you buy a one-year magazine subscription, you are
transferring risk.&nbsp; The magazine company is at risk if
the price of its magazines goes way up.&nbsp; Of course, you
are at risk if the price stays the same or falls.&nbsp; But
for the up-front fee, you both consider the risks
mutually beneficial.&nbsp; Out of economic necessity, the
options markets were created in 1973 as a standardized
way for the financial markets to transfer risk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In most cases, options can be purchased through most
brokerage firms with just as much ease as a stock.&nbsp;
Usually, you will need to fill out an options
application and wait a few days to get approval.&nbsp; Do not
worry if you do not get approved or are not comfortable
with options, as we have another way for you to hedge
yourself that will be discussed later.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>More about options</h2>
<p>What exactly is an option?&nbsp; Options are assets that
give owners the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
sell certain securities (or indexes) at a fixed price
over a given amount of time.&nbsp; Since the owner has the
&quot;right, but not the obligation,&quot; this means that the
owner of an option chooses whether or not to buy or sell
-- it is their <i>option </i>to do so, hence the name.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of options; <i>calls</i>
and <i>puts</i>.&nbsp; Call options give the owner the right
to buy the stock (or &quot;call&quot; it away from the owner),
while put options give the owner the right to sell the
stock (or &quot;put&quot; it back to the seller).&nbsp; This is a
contractual obligation, controlled through a clearing
firm (called the Options Clearing Corp. or OCC), so
there is no need to worry about a defaulting party on
the other side of the transaction.&nbsp; Because they are
contractual obligations, options are traded in units
called <i>contracts</i>, just as stock is traded in
shares, with one contract usually representing 100
shares of stock.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Options are standardized meaning there are only
certain prices at which you can agree to buy/sell stock
as well as specific time frames.&nbsp; The prices are set by
the exchange at fixed intervals and are known as <i>
strikes</i>, because that is the price where the
contract is struck.&nbsp; As for the time frames, you will
always find at least four different months being traded
for stock options.&nbsp; There will always be the current
month, the following month, and at least two additional
months.&nbsp; Also, there may be longer-term options that can
go as long as three years.&nbsp; Options do have a specified
expiration date which, for trading purposes, is the <u>
third Friday</u> of the month. </p>
<p>That's a lot of information, so an example should
make things clear.&nbsp; Let's say it is October and you are
bullish on XYZ stock trading at $50.&nbsp; You could purchase
a January $50 call option that gives you the right, but
not the obligation, to purchase XYZ for a price of $50
through expiration in January. &nbsp;Now, of course, there is
a fee for this, called the <i>premium</i>,<i> </i>and
let's say it is $5.&nbsp; This means that you are paying $5
per share, but remember, each contract controls 100
shares so the total purchase price for one contract
would be $500 plus commissions.&nbsp; Now, you have the right
to buy the stock at $50 per share at any time through
expiration.&nbsp; If XYZ is trading for $70 when the option
expires, the call option must be worth $20 (the
difference between the stock price and strike).&nbsp;
However, if XYZ is trading at $70 before expiration,
then the option will be worth <u>at least</u> $20 as
there will still be time remaining on the option and
investors are willing to pay for time.&nbsp; How much they
pay is up to the market and determined solely by supply
and demand for the option.&nbsp; Of course, if the stock
closes below $50, the option expires worthless so the
most you can lose is the amount paid, in this case,
$500.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, how do I
know the market makers won't try to rip me off and only
offer me $15 for the call when I decide to sell?&quot;</p>
<p>If XYZ is trading at $70 and the market makers are
bidding $15 for the $50 call, then the arbitrageurs will
step in and come to your rescue!&nbsp; These are people who
watch for price discrepancies in the market and are able
to make riskless transactions for guaranteed profits.&nbsp;
These transactions happen at lightning speeds and do not
last for long.&nbsp; Arbitrageurs will buy the call for $15,
sell short the stock, and receive $70 for a net credit
of $55.&nbsp; They will then <i>exercise </i>the option (use
it to buy stock) for $50 and keep the $5 profit --
exactly the amount the market maker, in this example,
was trying to steal!&nbsp; This process will continue until
it disappears, at which point, the option will be
trading for $20.&nbsp; So have no fear, the market makers
cannot steal the <i>intrinsic</i> value (the difference
between the stock and strike) of your option!</p>
<p>What if you were bearish on XYZ?&nbsp; Well, you could
instead buy a January $50 put.&nbsp; Now you have the right,
but not the obligation, to <i>sell</i> your stock for
$50 per share through expiration in January.&nbsp; If XYZ is
trading for $40 at option expiration, the put must be
worth $10 (the difference between the strike and the
stock price).&nbsp; If XYZ is trading at $40 before
expiration, the put must be worth <u>at least</u> $10,
as there will still be time remaining.&nbsp; If a market
maker decided to only bid $8 for the put, arbitrageurs
will buy the put for $8, buy the stock for $40 (far a
net debit of $48), exercise the put and sell the stock
for $50 for a guaranteed profit of $2.&nbsp; Again, this
process (which would be measured in seconds) will
continue until the put is priced fairly at $10.</p>
<p>So far, we have only considered the owners or buyers
of calls and puts.&nbsp; What about the person who sold
them?&nbsp; Well, the seller of any option has an obligation
to perform.&nbsp; If you sell a call, you must sell your
stock if and when the owner of the call chooses to buy
it.&nbsp; If you sell a put, you must buy the stock if and
when the owner of the put chooses to sell it.&nbsp; It is
only the owner (the long position) who has the right;
the seller (short position) has an obligation.</p>
<h2>Hedging your portfolio</h2>
<p>Now that you have the basics of options, let's look
at ways to hedge and see if hedging sounds like a good
idea to you!</p>
<p>Assume we are back in late May and you bought Intel
(INTC) at $55.&nbsp; Later, in mid July it's trading above
$70 and you decide to hedge by buying a January $70 put
trading for $10.&nbsp; </p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/023.gif'>

<p>By placing this trade, you have guaranteed yourself a
profit of at least $5 per share through expiration in
January.&nbsp; This is because you can always sell your
shares for $70 but it cost you $10 for a net of $60.&nbsp;
Because you paid $55 for the stock, the put guarantees
you $5 per share profit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now consider the advantages of this trade.&nbsp; If the
stock continues to move higher, we still participate in
the upside (less our $10 premium).&nbsp; But if the stock
starts to fall, as it did in mid-July when we bought our
put (see chart above), we now have removed the emotional
side out from our trading!&nbsp; The put allows us to focus
on fundamental values in the company, and not the
short-term downtrend.&nbsp; We can hold the stock, hoping for
an upturn, yet never regret it as we have locked in a
profit.&nbsp; There's also no fear of a maintenance call (for
those who trade on margin).&nbsp; Best of all, it's easy to
sleep at night knowing you never have to look back
thinking &quot;I should have sold that back when it was $70&quot;
because now you have the option to do so!&nbsp; It's not a
bad deal if you think about it -- guaranteed profit of
at least $5, with no limit to the upside, and we have
all the way until January reap our rewards.</p>
<p>Some people think the &quot;downside&quot; to this trade is if
the stock continues to run higher and you &quot;wasted&quot; your
$10 on the put.&nbsp; However, is your home insurance a waste
just because it never caught fire?&nbsp; Of course not, and
you shouldn't feel that way about the put either.&nbsp; In
fact, because you still participate in all of the upside
movement of the stock, the best thing to happen is for
the stock to climb higher, leaving your put worthless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Let's look at our profit and loss profile (at option
expiration) on the trade above with and without the put.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the value of the protection here.&nbsp;
Look at the profit/loss for the two positions in the
table above.&nbsp; If the stock closes at $100, the long
stock position will have a gain of $45 points ($100
minus the $55 cost), while the long stock/long put
position will have a gain of $35 (this is due to the $10
spent on the put).&nbsp; There will always be a $10
difference between the two positions for all stock
prices at $70 or above.&nbsp; So the investor that hedged the
portfolio will only be off by $10 in terms of profit and
loss to the upside, but look at the difference to the
downside!&nbsp; </p>
<p>For any stock price below $60, the hedged portfolio
dominates.&nbsp; For example, say the stock closes at $40.&nbsp;
The investor who bought the shares at $55 is down $15
points.&nbsp; The investor who hedged is also down $15 on the
stock but the $70 put must be worth at least $30 points
(the difference between the strike and the stock
price).&nbsp; This gives a profit of $15; however, we must
subtract out the $10 cost of the put, which gives us a
total profit of $5.&nbsp; This $5 profit will hold for all
stock prices below the $70 strike of the put.&nbsp; This is
exactly what happens in a fully hedged position.&nbsp; The
loss on the stock is exactly offset by the gain in the
option.</p>
<p>Options can be very versatile and there is no need to
necessarily have hedged our imaginary position above at
$70.&nbsp; If you are willing to take a $5 point
&quot;deductible,&quot; you could have elected to purchase a $65
put which would be cheaper than the $70 for exactly the
same reason your auto insurance is cheaper when you
assume <u>some</u> of the risk through a deductible.&nbsp;
The options market will always give less value to a put
with a lower strike with all other factors being the
same.&nbsp; So the choice is yours...do you want more
protection or cheaper cost?&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Hedging with no out-of-pocket expense</h2>
<p>There is another hedging technique that may be
interesting to you.&nbsp; This one allows you to hedge all
the downside risk, as above, but without paying for it!&nbsp;
Of course, nothing is free in the financial markets, so
what's the catch?&nbsp; The catch is that you must be willing
to give up some or all of your upside potential in the
stock.&nbsp; We do this by <i>selling</i> call options
against the stock and then using that money to buy the
puts.&nbsp; Remember that when we sell an option we have an
obligation.&nbsp; So if the person who buys the call from us
elects to buy our shares, we must sell.&nbsp; This hedging
strategy is sometimes called a <i>collar</i>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's run through an example with the same INTC trade
above.&nbsp; Again, we bought shares at $55 and the stock is
now $70.&nbsp; The $70 put is trading for $10.&nbsp; We could sell
the $75 call option and buy the $70 put.&nbsp; Depending on
where they are trading, this trade may result in only a
slight debit instead of the $10 we paid before.&nbsp; Or we
could buy the $65 put and sell the $75 call for a credit
of about one.&nbsp; That's right, depending on which options
we choose, we can actually get paid to put on the
hedge.&nbsp; But be careful, the only way to get a credit is
to allow for a bigger downside loss.&nbsp; It doesn't mean
that it's necessarily a bad trade, it's just that the
credit doesn't come for free.</p>
<p>For example, say we sell the $75 call and buy the $65
put for a net credit of $1.&nbsp; This means we actually get
paid $100 per contract.&nbsp; Now, what does the profit and
loss look like at option expiration?</p>

</table>
<p>Now compare this profit/loss (at expiration) table to
the previous one.&nbsp; We can easily see that we have
sacrificed upside potential, as our max gain with the
collar is only $21 regardless of how high the stock
goes.&nbsp; However, because we didn't pay $10 for the put,
our downside is much higher with a credit of $11 instead
of $5.</p>
<p>To recap, hedging is a method of maintaining upside
potential, whether limited or unlimited, and reducing
our downside loss.&nbsp; Hopefully, it is now apparent that
hedging can be beneficial!&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Hedging without options</h2>
<p>There is a really nice way to hedge your portfolio
without the use of options.&nbsp; Through the use of &quot;bear&quot;
mutual funds, mutual funds that go up in price as the
market falls, one can easily hedge a portfolio.&nbsp;
However, some funds are better than others for hedging.&nbsp;
One that we like to utilize from time to time is the
ProFunds UltraShort OTC Fund (USPIX).&nbsp; This fund is
unique in that it produces <u>double </u>the inverse of
the Nasdaq 100 (NDX), the most volatile of all indices.&nbsp;
So if the NDX is down 5%, this fund will be up 10%.&nbsp; Of
course, the reverse is true too; if the NDX is up 5%,
the fund will be down 10%.&nbsp; Further benefits are that
you are not on margin, as would normally be the case to
produce a 2:1 performance ratio.&nbsp; Also, you do not need
options approval and there is no expiration as with
options.&nbsp; You are also not exposed to &quot;time decay&quot; which
is the portion of the option premium that erodes with
the passage of time.&nbsp; On the downside, mutual funds only
trade at one time -- in the evening after the close --
so you cannot trade them intra-day.&nbsp; But if you have a
heavily laden tech portfolio and are looking for a
relatively cheap way to hedge, USPIX is tough to beat!
</p>
<p>These are just the basics of options and hedging, and
are intended to show the benefits of hedging, which can
be very important at certain times in the market.</p>
<p>We will be recommending various hedges for winning
positions and we want you to be aware of the idea and
philosophy behind them.&nbsp; Please understand that these
are just the basics; there are numerous factors to
consider before placing a hedge.&nbsp; Some of the factors
are the deltas and gammas (options sensitivity measures)
as well as implied and historical volatilities.&nbsp;
Sometimes we will utilize roll-up or roll-down
strategies as well as dollar-cost or constant-dollar
methods.&nbsp; But that's what we are here for.&nbsp; As a
subscriber, you can be assured that we look at all
relevant factors, combine them with a lot of research
and expertise, and relay the information to you as
quickly as possible to insure winning trades.</p>
<p>Remember, in a bear market, the money returns to its
rightful owner.&nbsp; Hedging can keep you from giving it
back!</p>
