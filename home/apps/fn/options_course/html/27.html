<h1>More Delta Gamma</h1>

<p>The concept of delta and gamma are of utmost
importance for the option trader.&nbsp; In our section
&quot;Deltas and Gammas&quot; we learned that delta measures
direction and gamma measures speed of the option.&nbsp; But
it was presented in a format to understand the concepts
without the use of numbers.</p>
<p>In this section, we will broaden the concept of delta
and zero-in on an exact definition you can use and
understand.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The importance of delta cannot be emphasized enough;
understanding it will most likely change the way you
pick your option trades.</p>
<h2>The concept of delta</h2>
<p>Delta is a mathematical relationship between the
option and the underlying stock.&nbsp; It expresses the
dollar amount the option will increase for a very small
move in the underlying stock.&nbsp; How much is a small
move?&nbsp; Technically we mean very small (as in
infinitesimal) but it will probably be easier to
understand if you think of a $1 move in the underlying
stock.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, say an option is trading for $50 and has
a delta of 1/2.&nbsp; If the stock were to move up $1 to $51
rather quickly, we would expect the price of the option
to move up $1/2 from $5 to $5-1/2.&nbsp; In other words, the
stock gained 1 point but the option only gained 1/2
point.&nbsp; If that same option, instead, had a delta of
1/4, then the price of the option would have moved to
$5-1/4 -- only 1/4 the move of the stock.</p>
<p>Delta will always be a number between 0 and 1 for
calls (0 and -1 for puts).&nbsp; There are some exceptions to
this but they are usually minor and not too important
for trading purposes.&nbsp; Delta constantly changes
primarily from moves in stock price, time or volatility.</p>
<p>We now want to find out why the option does not move
point-for-point with the stock.&nbsp; This may sound trivial,
but it will change the way you see and understand
options!</p>
<p>It will take some basic math but we will make it as
easy as possible.&nbsp; We will start first with a simple
analogy to get the idea of why deltas exist.</p>
<h2>Why does delta exist?</h2>
<p>This often confuses the new options trader.&nbsp; Often
they will purchase an out-of-the-money call option that
sits relatively flat in price -- even though the
underlying stock is moving up.&nbsp; They wonder how that can
be since call options are supposed to go up in value as
the stock moves up.&nbsp; If you understand the following
analogy, you will understand why the market will not
price your option point-for-point with the underlying
stock unless the option is very deep-in-the-money or
in-the-money with little time remaining.</p>
<h2>Analogy: Promotional cell phone coupon</h2>
<p>Assume you are holding a promotional coupon that
allows you to purchase a particular cell phone for
$100.&nbsp; The phone actually sells for $120.&nbsp; Also assume
that this coupon is marketable; that is, it can be
bought and sold freely and there are a large number of
buyers and sellers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that this is similar to a call option; it
gives the buyer the right to buy the asset for a fixed
price.</p>
<p>If these assumptions are true, the coupon should be
trading for $20.&nbsp; This is because someone could buy the
coupon for $20 and use it to buy the phone for $100.&nbsp;
The total purchase price would be $120, which is the
market price of the phone.&nbsp; In this case, there is no
net advantage to owning the coupon.&nbsp; The markets will
always make sure there is not net advantage to owning
one asset over another, otherwise arbitrageurs will
correct for it.</p>
<p>Let's look at two different scenarios and see how the
coupon will react:</p>
<h2>Scenario I</h2>
<p>It is announced to the market that the price of the
phone <u>will increase</u> to $130.&nbsp; What will happen to
the price of the coupon?&nbsp; For the same reasons as above,
it will immediately move to $30.&nbsp; A consumer could buy
the coupon for $30 and use it to pay $100 for the phone
thus paying $130 -- the market price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that the phone jumped by $10 (from $120 to
$130) and so did the coupon (from $20 to $30).&nbsp; We could
say the delta of the coupon is one.&nbsp; In other words, the
coupon appreciates dollar-for-dollar with moves in the
underlying asset, in this case, the phone.&nbsp; This will be
true for any price appreciation or depreciation in the
phone (assuming the phone price does not drop below $100
because the coupon cannot have negative value).</p>
<h2>Scenario II</h2>
<p>Let's say the phone company executives are meeting
tonight and will decide if the phone price should be
raised from $120 to $130.&nbsp; These executives are in a
deadlock and have decided to break the tie by flipping a
coin: heads they raise the price, tails they do not.&nbsp; It
is announced to the market that the price of the phone
<u>may increase</u> to $130 with a 50%-50% chance;
otherwise the price will stay the same.</p>
<p>Now comes the tricky part.&nbsp; What happens to the price
of the coupon?</p>
<p>Think about this, the price of the coupon will either
move to $130 or stay at $120 with a 50%-50% chance.&nbsp; If
the market does not bid up the price of the coupon,
there is an inherent advantage for a speculator; they
will bid up the price hoping the decision is to raise
the price of the phone.&nbsp; The reason is this:&nbsp; If faced
with this same situation multiple times, half of the
time investors would make $10 (when phone is raised to
$130 and coupon jumps from $20 to $30) and half the time
they will not make anything (when phone price stays the
same and coupon stays priced at $20).&nbsp; So on average, if
given this opportunity multiple times, investors will
make $5; they make $10 half the time and make nothing
half the time.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this can be shown as follows:</p>
<p>(1/2) * (+$10) = $5<br>
(1/2) * ( $0 ) =&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>$0</u><br>
Net gain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +$5</p>
<p>Mathematically, this is called the <i>expected value</i>
and is key to understanding delta.&nbsp; The expected value
is nothing more than the sum of the probabilities
multiplied by the outcomes.</p>
<p>So what should speculators do?&nbsp; They should bid up
the price of the coupon to where there is no net
advantage -- they bid it to $25.&nbsp; If not, the market
will continue to compete for the difference.&nbsp; For
example, if the market only bids the price to $24, now
speculators have a $1 net advantage.</p>
<p>The expected value is:</p>
<p>(1/2) * (+$6) =&nbsp; +$3<br>
(1/2) * (-$4) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>-$2</u><br>
Net gain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$1</p>
<p>With the coupon priced at $24, speculators are
putting $4 at risk in order to make $10.&nbsp; Half the time
they will win for a net gain of $6, and half the time
they lose for a net loss of $4.&nbsp; If they were allowed to
do this many times, they would expect to win, on
average, $1 per time.&nbsp; So they continue to bid the price
of the coupon to $25 so there is not net advantage.</p>
<p>When priced at $25, the expected value of the coupon
is:</p>
<p>(1/2) * (+$5) =&nbsp;&nbsp;+$2.5<br>
(1/2) * (-$5) = &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;-$2.5</u><br>
Net gain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0<br>
When the prices rises to $25, the buying pressure stops.</p>
<p>What happens if the markets immediately price the
coupon to $30 as they did in scenario I?&nbsp; For similar
reasons, if the market prices the coupon at&nbsp; $30, again
there is an inherent advantage for the speculator; they
will sell it because it is theoretically overpriced.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The expected value will be:</p>
<p>(1/2) * (+$10) = +$5<br>
(1/2) * ($0) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>$0</u><br>
Net gain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +$5</p>
<p>Half the time speculators will make $10 by selling
the coupon at $30 and buying it back for $20 when the
phone price is not raised; otherwise, they make nothing
(sell coupon for $30 and buy it back for $30).&nbsp; Again,
there is a net advantage to being short so speculators
will compete for this money.&nbsp; For the same reasons as
above, they will continue selling the coupon until the
price is $25.</p>
<p>When the price falls to $25, the selling pressure
stops.</p>
<h2>Understanding delta</h2>
<p>Let me give you a simple definition of delta and
hopefully you will understand why the markets will not
give you dollar-for-dollar moves on your option.&nbsp; </p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Definition:</b><br>
Delta is the probability that the option will
have intrinsic value at expiration.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now that you know exactly what delta is, you should
immediately understand why it exists.&nbsp; If an option has
a delta of-1/2, then the markets will only compensate
you for-1/2 of the move in the underlying -- otherwise
there will be a net advantage for speculators to buy or
sell!&nbsp; This is exactly what happened with the cell phone
example in scenario II.</p>
<p>Once the option is deep-in-the-money or in-the-money
with little time remaining, the market will increase the
price of your option dollar-for-dollar with moves in the
underlying.&nbsp; This is because the market is effectively
saying that the option will expire with intrinsic
value.&nbsp; This is exactly what happened in scenario I with
the cell phone coupon.&nbsp; It was announced that the price
<u>will be</u> increased; in other words, it is 100%
guaranteed to happen.&nbsp; When the market heard this news,
they priced the coupon dollar-for-dollar.</p>
<h2>New Uses For Delta </h2>
<p>You may hear that delta is of little concern for the
average investor and only used as a theoretical hedging
value for floor traders.&nbsp; While it is true that it can
be used in this sense, there are also a great deal of
insights that are practical, if not necessary, for
retail investors.</p>
<p>First, because we know delta is the probability that
the option will have intrinsic value at expiration, it
will shed some light on your option picks.&nbsp; Often, new
traders are attracted to the short-term,
out-of-the-money option because it is cheap.&nbsp; If it has
a long way to get to the strike and little time to do
it, what kind of probability do you think the markets
are assigning to it?&nbsp; If you said very low, you're
right.&nbsp; The delta on short-term, out-of-the-moneys are
usually in the neighborhood of 0 to 20%.&nbsp; Now you know
why they don't appreciate dollar-for-dollar with moves
in the underlying.&nbsp; Usually, these options are lucky to
see a few cents appreciation in them, but are often
eaten away by bid-ask spreads.</p>
<p>If you're not having a lot of success with your
option trades despite getting the direction of the stock
right, try using ones with higher deltas!</p>
<h2>What are the chances I will have my stock called
away?</h2>
<p>Here is another use and one we get a lot of questions
on.&nbsp; Many times investors will be in a covered call
position (long stock and short call) and ask, &quot;What do
you think the chances are that I will have my stock
called away?&quot;&nbsp; Most brokers will tell you there is no
way to know but this is completely false.&nbsp; The answer is
the delta.&nbsp; If you are long stock and short a call with
a delta of 0.70, at this time, the markets are telling
you there is a 70% chance you will lose your stock.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we said &quot;at this time&quot; there is a
70% chance.&nbsp; Obviously as information changes, so will
the delta.</p>
<h2>Why Deltas Change</h2>
<p>The main factors that affect delta are stock price
movement, time and volatility in the underlying stock.&nbsp;
Let's find out how these factors affect delta and why.</p>
<p>Again, we could use a lot of math, but a simple
analogy will probably work better.</p>
<p>Let's assume you are an odds maker for an upcoming
basketball game.&nbsp; It's the Miami Heat vs. the Orlando
Magic.&nbsp; You do your analysis and decide that the Heat
have a 60% chance of winning.</p>
<p>There are now 10 minutes remaining in the game and
the score is Miami: 70 Orlando: 72.&nbsp; As the odds maker,
should you change your odds at this point?&nbsp; Probably
not, as the score is too close and there is too much
time remaining to be sure.</p>
<h2>Example 1:</h2>
<p>Let's say that, instead, the score is Miami: 80,
Orlando:70 with 5 minutes remaining.&nbsp; Now, because your
team is a good bit ahead, although not unbeatable, you
will probably decide to increase your odds, right?&nbsp; You
may now, for example, think Miami has a 70% chance of
winning.</p>
<p>Your job as the odds maker is to decide which team
will win.&nbsp; Well, that's exactly what the market does
with options.&nbsp; The market tries to determine which
options will win -- which ones will have intrinsic value
at expiration.&nbsp; So as your option goes
deeper-in-the-money, the odds of it expiring with
intrinsic value will increase; that is, the deltas will
increase.</p>
<p><b>As the stock rises, call deltas increase and put
deltas decrease.</b></p>
<p>Now back to the basketball game.</p>
<h2>Example 2:</h2>
<p>Let's now assume that the score is Miami: 86,
Orlando: 80.&nbsp; If we still had 5 minutes on the clock,
this would be a close one to call.&nbsp; Instead, let's drop
the time to only 30 seconds remaining.&nbsp; Now you would
almost certainly boost your odds to nearly 100%; it's
almost a sure thing the Heat will win.</p>
<p>Notice the difference with the above examples.&nbsp; In
the first example, a ten-point difference in scores
boosted the odds from 60% to 70%.&nbsp; However, in the
second example, a 5-point difference with little time
boosted us to nearly 100%.&nbsp; Remember, you are trying to
determine which team will win.&nbsp; In this case, you as the
odds maker see no way for the Magic to win at this
point, so you boost the odds for the Heat to nearly
100%.</p>
<p><b>As time decreases, options with intrinsic value
will have delta increase.&nbsp; Out-of-the-money options will
have deltas decrease.</b></p>
<p>In other words, the options that are &quot;winners&quot; (have
intrinsic value) are becoming more likely to stay that
way as time decreases.</p>
<h2>Example 3:</h2>
<p>Still assume that the score is Miami: 86, Orlando: 80
with 30 seconds on the clock as in the second example.&nbsp;
But this time, some key players for the Heat suddenly
get removed from the game.&nbsp; Because of this, the Heat's
scoring ability has now been reduced.&nbsp; As the odds
maker, instead of increasing the Heat from 70% to 100%,
you would either not increase them as much or possibly
decrease them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A losing team is helped by adding key players to the
game (or having key players removed from the winning
team).</p>
<p>This is what happens when volatility is increased in
the underlying stock.&nbsp; A losing option
(out-of-the-money) is helped by increased volatility; it
now has a chance to become a winning option and the
deltas will increase.&nbsp; Similarly, an in-the-money option
is hurt by volatility; it may now end up
out-of-the-money.</p>
<p><b>As volatility increases, out-of-the-money options
will increase deltas and in-the-money options will lose
deltas.</b></p>
<p>An easy way to remember time and volatility concepts
is that they are synonymous. </p>
<p><b>As time or volatility increase all options become
more at-the-money!</b></p>
<p>To be a good trader, it is not necessary to know the
actual number for delta as much as it is to know the
relationships between delta, stock price, time, and
volatility.</p>
<p>Let's run through some examples to be sure you've got
it.</p>
<p><b>1) The stock is at $50.&nbsp; Which option has a higher
delta, a one-month $60 call or a 6-month $60 call?&nbsp; Why?</b></p>
<p>Remember, the market is trying to assign odds as to
which option will be a winner or in-the-money.&nbsp; Because
both are out-of-the-money, you would have to assign a
higher probability to the 6-month call.&nbsp; It is much more
likely to be a winner relative to the one-month call.&nbsp;
The 6-month call will have the higher delta.&nbsp; If the
underlying stock move up $1, the 6-month call will
appreciate more relative to the 1-month.</p>
<p><b>2) The stock is $100.&nbsp; Which has a higher delta, a
one-month $90 call or a 3-month $90 call?&nbsp; Why?</b></p>
<p>Both of these options are currently winners because
they are in-the-money.&nbsp; But the 3-month option is more
likely to become a loser relative to the 1-month so the
1-month, will have a higher delta.&nbsp; If the underlying
stock moves up $1, the 1-month option will appreciate
more relative to the 3-month.</p>
<p>Remember, once you are winning, you want the time
clock to go to zero!</p>
<p><b>3) The stock is $50 and a 3-month $55 call has a
delta of 0.45.&nbsp; Suddenly, there is increased volatility
in the stock.&nbsp; Does delta increase or decrease?</b></p>
<p>The option is currently &quot;losing&quot; because it is
out-of-the-money.&nbsp; But with the added volatility, it is
much more likely to become a winner.&nbsp; Delta will
increase. </p>
<p><b>4) A stock is trading at $75.&nbsp; What is the delta
of a $75 strike call?</b></p>
<p>Because this option is at-the-money, it is riding the
fence of being in or out-of-the-money.&nbsp; The delta will
be very close to-1/2.&nbsp; Technically, the delta will be a
little higher because of the continuous compounding
assumption in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.&nbsp;
But for most trading purposes, an at-the-money option
has a delta of-1/2.</p>
<p><b>5) You want to use a call option as a substitute
for stock.&nbsp; Would you look at short or long term?&nbsp;
In-the-money or out-of-the-money?</b></p>
<p>If you really want the option to behave virtually
like stock, you should look at short-term,
deep-in-the-money calls.&nbsp; Because, these are
in-the-money with little time, there is close to a 100%
chance they will expire with intrinsic value, so the
market will have to increase the option
dollar-for-dollar with moves in the underlying stock.
</p>
<p>If you continue to work with the concept of delta, it
will greatly help you with your option trades whether
beginning or advanced.&nbsp; It will shed new light on the
risks involved with short-term out-of-the-money
options.&nbsp; It will show why longer-term options are more
desirable than shorter term if you are looking at
out-of-the-money options.&nbsp; You will start to understand
strategies in new ways and more closely match your
positions to your opinion on the market.&nbsp; You will
become a more informed and accomplished options trader,
and that can only mean better trades!</p>
