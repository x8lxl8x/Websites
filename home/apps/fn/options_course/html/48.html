<h1>Synthetic Options</h1>

<p>The name sure sounds intimidating, but synthetic
options are fairly easy to understand and are truly a
fascinating and useful part of options trading.&nbsp;
Understanding synthetic positions will allow you to <i>
effectively</i> do things many traders will tell you
cannot be done, such as shorting stock on a downtick (or
even when no stock is available), buying calls or
selling naked puts in an IRA, buying stock for virtually
no money, and a host of other imaginative strategies.&nbsp;
Further, understanding synthetics will give you great
insights into option pricing.&nbsp; You will understand how
options are created, and why the market makers are
quoting the puts and calls the way they are.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In order to understand these mysterious sounding
options, you need to understand one of the most
fundamental concepts of option pricing known as <i>
put-call parity</i>.</p>
<h2>Put-call parity</h2>
<p>Put-call parity is a relationship showing that call
and put prices are very dependent on one another, and
not just arbitrarily chosen.&nbsp; In order to understand the
put-call parity equation better, it's best to show how
orders are filled on the floor of the exchange.&nbsp; Here's
an example of how it works:</p>
<p>Say you want to buy 10 calls to open of the ABC $50
strike (with 1 year to expiration) at market.&nbsp; ABC stock
is also trading at $50.</p>
<p>When this buy order is received on the floor, the
market maker must become the seller so that the
transaction can be completed.&nbsp; This means the market
maker must be willing to be <i>short</i> a call.&nbsp; Now,
while you may be totally comfortable in speculating by
buying 10 calls, the market maker may not be so eager to
be on the short side.&nbsp; The reason is this: Market makers
are in the business to take 1/8th's or 1/4th's of a
point on a large number of trades; they are not really
too interested in holding open speculative positions
over long periods of time -- especially short calls that
have unlimited upside risk! </p>
<h2>How does the market maker create a short call?</h2>
<p>If the market maker is to be short a one-year call,
his risk will be that the stock goes higher.&nbsp; So, in
order to protect himself from this risk, he will
purchase 1,000 shares.&nbsp; No matter how high the stock
moves, he will always be able to deliver 1,000 shares of
stock (represented by the 10 calls) at expiration.</p>
<p>However, now there is a new risk; the stock may
fall.&nbsp; So to protect himself from this, he will buy a
$50 put with one year to expiration.</p>
<p>Now our market maker is now long 1,000 shares of
stock, long 10 $50 put options and short 10 $50 call
options.&nbsp; Because he is short 10 calls, he can now fill
your order to be long 10 calls.&nbsp; But what price should
he charge?</p>
<p>Here is what's interesting about this position:&nbsp; The
market maker is now fully hedged (protected) against any
stock price movement at expiration.&nbsp; This means he
cannot lose on the position!&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Well, the stock
price can do one of three things between now and
expiration of the call:It can stay the same, go up or go
down.&nbsp; If the stock stays exactly at $50, the call and
put expire worthless and the market maker's position is
worth exactly $50,000, which is the amount he originally
paid for the stock.&nbsp; If the stock closes above $50, the
long put will expire worthless and the market maker will
get assigned on the short call and lose the stock;
however, he will be paid the $50 strike and receive
exactly $50,000.&nbsp; Likewise, if the stock closes below
$50 at expiration, the short call will expire worthless
and the market maker will exercise his put and receive
$50,000. </p>
<p>With the long stock at $50, long $50 put and short
$50 call, the market maker is now <u>guaranteed</u> to
receive $50,000 in one year.&nbsp; It is kind of ironic by
using these speculative derivatives of puts and calls we
can actually create a risk-free portfolio!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, if any financial asset is guaranteed to be worth
a certain amount in the future, then its value today
must be worth the <i>present value</i> discounted at the
risk-free rate of interest.&nbsp; </p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>PRESENT VALUE/FUTURE VALUE</b>&nbsp;are &quot;time
value of money&quot; concepts used throughout the
financial industry to describe the value of
assets at different points in time.&nbsp; The concept
of time value says that a dollar today is worth
more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar
today can be invested and earn interest.&nbsp; For
example, if you deposit $100 into an account
that pays 5% interest, you will have $100 (1+5%)
= $105 in the future.&nbsp; So the <b><i>future value</i></b>
of $100 today is $105 if interest rates are 5%.&nbsp;
<p>Similarly, if someone owes you $105 one year
from now and interest rates are 5%, then you
should be willing to accept $105/(1+5%) = $100
today.&nbsp; In other words, it should make no
difference to you by waiting one year and
receiving $105 or collecting $100 today.&nbsp; The
reason is that you can take the $100 today,
invest it at 5% for one year, and still have
your $105 a year from now.&nbsp; So the <b><i>present
value</i></b> of $105 one year from now is $100
(if rates are 5%).&nbsp; To calculate the present
value, we simply take the future value of the
asset and divide it by 1 + risk-free interest
rate.</td>

</table>
<p>The market maker is guaranteed to receive $50,000 in
one year regardless of the stock price.&nbsp; So the present
value of $50,000 in one year is $50,000 / (1.05) =
$47,619 today.&nbsp; The market maker should pay $47,619
today for these three assets -- the stock, long put and
short call positions.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If he pays $47,619 and
receives $50,000 in one year, his return on investment
will be 5%, which is exactly the interest rate he should
receive for a risk-free investment.</p>
<p>The market maker will spend $50,000 for the 1,000
shares of stock trading at $50.&nbsp; Let's also assume he
pays $5 for the put.&nbsp; Now he will spend an additional
$5,000 for the put for a total cash outlay of $55,000.&nbsp;
We already figured that the fair price for this package
of three assets should be worth $47,619 yet he's paying
$55,000 for it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The market maker has overpaid by $55,000 -&nbsp; $47,619 =
$7,381, so he will need to bring in a credit for this
amount.&nbsp; How can the market maker receive a credit of
$7,381?&nbsp; Easy -- he will fill your order on the 10 $50
calls for roughly $7-3/8.&nbsp; Doing so, he will receive the
necessary credit to make his -$55,000 cash outlay equal
to -$47,619.&nbsp; Of course, the market maker will try to
make an 1/8 or 1/4 point profit, so the order would
probably be filled around $7-1/2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To summarize, the market maker's initial position
looks like this:</p>
<p>Buy 1000 shares at $50 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$50,000<br>
Buy 10 $50 puts at $5 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$5,000<br>
Sells 10 $50 calls at $7 3/8 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$7,375</u><br>
Equals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$47,625 cash
outlay by market maker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is guaranteed to grow to a value of $50,000 in
one year ($47,625 * 1.05 = $50,000) because of the full
hedge provided by the 3-sided position.</p>
<p>This three-sided position (long stock + long put +
short call) established by the market maker is called a
<i>conversion.&nbsp; </i>If he does the reverse (i.e. short
stock + short puts + long calls) then it is called a <i>
reversal </i>or<i> reverse conversion</i>.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>The put-call parity equation</h2>
<p>We have shown that the market maker's three-sided
position (conversion) is guaranteed to be worth the
present value of the exercise price.&nbsp; Remember, he was
short $50 calls and long $50 puts; the stock must either
be above or below this price at expiration, resulting in
a cash inflow of $50 -- the exercise price.&nbsp; Because
he's guaranteed this strike price, the long stock + long
put + short call position must be worth the present
value of the exercise price.&nbsp; We can rewrite this using
S for stock price, P for put price, C for call price,
and E for exercise price as follows:</p>
<h2>S + P - C = Present Value E</h2>
<p>And therein lies the magic of synthetic options!</p>
<p>Notice the notation with the plus and minus signs.&nbsp;
The long put position is denoted by a &quot;+&quot; sign and the
short call is denoted by &quot;-&quot;.&nbsp; This will be important to
remember later.</p>
<p>To make things a little easier to understand, we know
the present value of E (the right side of the equation)
is guaranteed to grow to E so it behaves like a
risk-free investment -- a T-bill (or Treasury bill,
treasury note or treasury bond).&nbsp; We can therefore
rewrite the above equation as:</p>
<h2>S + P - C = T-bill</h2>
<p>With some very basic algebra, we can create many
interesting positions.&nbsp; We will take it slow with lots
of examples, so hang in there!</p>
<p>This equation is known as put-call parity.&nbsp; If you
know the value of a call option, you can immediately
figure out the value of the put.</p>
<h2>One small adjustment</h2>
<p>Before we can continue with some examples, there is
one note we need to make with an example.&nbsp; Let's say we
are interested in seeing what a long stock + long put
position are equal to.&nbsp; Using the equation, S + P - C =
T-bill, how can we get the S + P (the pieces we are
interested in) by themselves?&nbsp; Algebraically, we need to
get the C to the other side of the equal sign; we need
to add C to both sides.&nbsp; Now we have S + P = C + T-bill.</p>
<p>What does this mean?&nbsp; It means that someone holding
long stock and a long put in a portfolio (the left side
of the equation) will have <u>exactly</u> the same
portfolio balance at option expiration as another person
holding a call plus a T-bill (the right side of the
equation).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's see if it holds true:</p>
<p>Assume we are interested in 1-year options and
interest rates are 5%:</p>
<p>Investor A holds stock at $50 and a $50 put (left
side of the equation)</p>
<p>Investor B holds a $50 call and a T-bill (right side
of equation)</p>
<p>Investor B will pay $50,000/(1.05) = $47,619 for the
T-bill.</p>
<p>At expiration:</p>

<p>Regardless of where the stock closes, investor A will
be worth exactly the same as investor B; there are no
differences in the two portfolios.&nbsp; Why does this
happen?&nbsp; Portfolio A can never fall below $50 -- the
strike of the put.&nbsp; However, if the stock rises,
investor A will participate fully.&nbsp; Portfolio B must <i>
grow</i> to a value of $50 because that is the T-bill
portion and is guaranteed.&nbsp; Portfolio B, like A, can
never have a value below $50.&nbsp; If the stock rises,
investor B's call will start to increase in value by the
same amount as the increase in stock in A's portfolio so
both A and B receive all of the upside potential in the
stock. </p>
<p><b>Portfolio B is said to be the synthetic equivalent
of portfolio A.&nbsp; Also A can be said to be the synthetic
equivalent of B.</b></p>
<p>So, a synthetic equivalent -- or synthetic -- is any
position that has exactly the same profit and loss, <i>
at expiration</i>, as another position using different
instruments.</p>
<p>Now here's the one small adjustment I was referring
to at the beginning of this section.&nbsp; By definition,
synthetic positions only track the <i>changes </i>in
portfolios and not the total value.&nbsp; For example, in the
above example with investor A and B, the <u>total value</u>
of B's portfolio is the same as A's.&nbsp; To have the
synthetic equivalent, we only need to look at the
changes.&nbsp; If B just held the $50 call option and not the
T-bill, he would exactly reflect the <i>changes</i> in
A's portfolio.</p>
<p>For example, if A buys the stock for $50 and it falls
to $40, A can exercise the put and receive $50 -- so A
starts with a value of $50 and ends with $50 and
therefore has <i>no change</i>.&nbsp; Portfolio B would also
reflect no change as well.&nbsp; The $50 call will expire
with a value of zero.&nbsp; If the stock is trading at $60 at
expiration, portfolio A will be worth $60, from $50,
reflecting a change of $10.&nbsp; Portfolio B will also
change by $10, as the $50 call will now be worth $10.</p>
<p>The whole point of all this is that, with the
original equation S + P - C = T-bill, we can ignore the
T-bill on the right hand side; it accounts for total
value and not the changes in portfolio value.</p>
<p>Now our equation is even easier!&nbsp; All you need to
know is:</p>
<h2>S + P - C = ?</h2>
<p>And you can figure out any synthetic position!</p>
<h2>Synthetic positions</h2>
<p>Now that you have the necessary equation, let's work
through lots of examples to get the hang of synthetic
options.</p>
<p>For starters, remember that we said the above is
equal to a T-bill?&nbsp; Well, if you are long stock + long
put + short call you are said to be holding a synthetic
T-bill; the positions will behave exactly the same at
expiration.</p>
<p><b><u>Synthetic long call</u></b><br>
Using the equation, S + P - C = ?, we are in a position
to find out.&nbsp; We are trying to find out the synthetic
value of a <u>long</u> call, so we need to get a +C
(remember, we are using &quot;+&quot; to denote a long position)
on one side of the equation.&nbsp; If we add C to both sides
and we get: S + P = C, and there's the answer; long
stock and long put (left side of the equation) will
behave just like a long call (right side).&nbsp; Therefore,
if you hold long stock and a long put, you have a
synthetic call position.</p>
<p>Let's check the profit and loss diagrams to see if
we're correct:</p>

<p>We can easily see there is no difference between long
stock + long $50 put purchased at $5 (left chart) and
long $50 call purchased at $5.&nbsp; The person holding the
long stock and long put raised the cost basis of their
stock from $50 to $55, that's why their break-even point
is now $55.&nbsp; However, they still participate in all of
the upside movement of the stock.&nbsp; What if the stock
falls?&nbsp; The investor is protected for all prices below
$50, which is the strike of the put.&nbsp; The worst that can
happen is for the stock to fall to zero.&nbsp; This investor
will exercise the put and receive $50 effectively only
losing on the $5 they paid for the put; therefore the
maximum loss is $5.</p>
<p>For the call holder (right chart), they paid $5 so
their maximum loss is also $5 but they too participate
in all of the upside of the stock.&nbsp; The stock will have
to be $55 at expiration in order for the call holder to
break even.</p>
<p>It should now be apparent that call owners get <u>
downside</u> protection as well as a put holders; the
call keeps you from losing value in the stock because
you are not holding the stock!</p>
<p>So how do you own calls in an IRA?&nbsp; Now you should
know.&nbsp; Use the synthetic equivalent and buy the stock
and put.&nbsp; Your return on investment will be much lower
than the person who buys the call because of the
difference in capital required to purchase the stock,
but the two positions will behave the same way at
expiration.</p>
<p><b><u>Synthetic long stock</u></b><br>
Without looking ahead, see if you can use the equation S
+ P - C = ? and solve it for long stock.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because we have +S on the left side already, let's
move the C and P to the other side.&nbsp; To do this we need
to add C and subtract P from both sides.&nbsp; If you did it
correctly you should find that S = C - P.&nbsp; Now you know
that a trader holding a long call and short put (right
side of equation) are actually holding synthetic stock
(left side).</p>
<p>Looking at the profit and loss diagrams for each:</p>

<p>We see there is no difference in the two positions.&nbsp;
The long stock purchased at $50 (left chart) will gain
and lose point-for-point to the upside as well as the
downside.&nbsp; The same holds true for the long $50 call and
short $50 put (right chart).&nbsp; The $50 call will gain
point-for-point at expiration while the short put will
become a liability (loss) point-for-point if the stock
should fall. </p>
<p>So synthetic stock is long call plus a short put.&nbsp;
What would synthetic short stock be?&nbsp; Just the opposite,
long put and short calls.&nbsp; This is great to know for all
traders involved in short selling.&nbsp; Now you know how it
is possible to short stock without an uptick or when
stock is not even available for shorting -- use
synthetics and buy the put and sell the call.</p>
<p>How much will it cost to short synthetic stock?&nbsp;
Theoretically you should receive a credit.&nbsp; This can be
shown by the original equation S + P - C = Present value
of E.&nbsp; If we rearrange so that C - P = S - Present value
E we see that, if S and E are equal (in other words,
at-the-money), then S - Present value E must be a
positive number.&nbsp; In order for C - P to be positive, C
must be more expensive than P.&nbsp; Because you are buying
puts and shorting calls, you should get a slight
credit.&nbsp; Realistically though, because of bid-ask
spreads and commissions, it will probably cost you a
slight debit.</p>
<p><b><u>Synthetic covered call</u></b><br>
Hopefully you are getting the hang of this, but we'll do
one more to be sure.&nbsp; What is a synthetic covered call?&nbsp;
We know a covered call is long stock plus a short call,
so it would be represented by S - C in our equation.&nbsp;
Looking at the equation S + P - C = ?, we need to get S
and -C on one side.&nbsp; In order to do that, we can just
subtract P from both sides and get S - C = -P.&nbsp; A
covered call position is synthetically equivalent to a
short put.</p>

<p>As expected, the profit and loss diagrams are the
same.&nbsp; For the covered call position (left chart), the
investor buys stock at $50 and sells a $50 call for $5,
effectively giving the stock a cost basis of $45, which
is the break-even point.&nbsp; If the stock rallies, the
investor will be forced to sell it for $50 regardless of
how high the stock moves.&nbsp; The short put (right chart)
is at risk for all stock prices below $50, which is
offset by the $5 premium received, which gives a
break-even point of $45.</p>
<p>How can an investor sell puts in an IRA?&nbsp; Using
synthetics, one can buy stock and sell calls, which is
exactly the same thing from a profit and loss
standpoint.</p>
<p>It is a little ironic that most brokerage firms
require level 3 option approval to short puts yet
require only level 0 to enter covered call positions.&nbsp;
Synthetically, they are exactly the same thing.&nbsp; If you
wouldn't short a put on a particular stock, you
shouldn't enter into the covered call either.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you do enter a into a covered call
position, you should see the benefit of entering the
order as a buy-write (please see our section under
&quot;Buy-writes&quot; for more information).&nbsp; Doing so gives the
market maker two of the three sides necessary to
complete a reversal.&nbsp; This gives the market maker a
guaranteed trade so they are very eager to get them
filled.&nbsp; Most of the time, you will receive a better
fill than the natural at the time the trade is placed.

<h2>Practicing with synthetics</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to practice with the synthetic
relationships of any trade you are thinking of
entering.&nbsp; Doing so will help you understand synthetics
as well as give you additional insights into the way the
trade will behave at expiration.</p>
<p>As a guide, remember that there are three pieces to
the puzzle: Stock, calls and puts.&nbsp; The synthetic of any
one of the pieces will always be some combination,
either long or short, of the remaining two.&nbsp; For
example, a synthetic call will be some combination of
stock and puts.&nbsp; Synthetic stock will be a combination
of calls and puts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once you become proficient with synthetics, you will
certainly become a better options trader!</p>
