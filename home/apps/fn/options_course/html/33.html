<h1>Equity Collar</h1>

<p>The <i>equity collar</i> or sometimes just <i>collar</i>
is a popular strategy among institutional and floor
traders.&nbsp; It can also a great strategy for retail
investors, although most are unfamiliar with it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Equity collars involves long stock paired with a long
put and short call to provide <u>limited</u> upside
profits in exchange for <u>limited</u> downside losses.</p>
<h2>Equity collar example:</h2>
<p>Assume an investor is long 1,000 shares of stock at
$100.&nbsp; He is willing to sell the stock at $105, but is
also worried about the downside risk.&nbsp; He could sell the
$105 calls, and use those proceeds to finance the long
$95 puts.&nbsp; These three positions, long stock, short
call, and long put make up an equity collar.</p>
<p>There is no reason this investor must sell the $105
call and buy the $95 put.&nbsp; Instead, he could sell the
$100 call and buy the $100 put, or sell the $110 call
and buy the $100 put.&nbsp; There are many ways to position
the collar including out-of-the-money, at-the-money and
in-the-money options.&nbsp; Each has a unique set of risks
and rewards and we will look at many variations.</p>
<p>First, notice a couple of things about the collar.&nbsp;
The above investor was long stock and then sold the $105
calls -- a covered call position.&nbsp; However, the risk of
a covered call is to the downside (please see our
section on &quot;Covered Calls&quot; and &quot;Synthetics&quot; if you are
not sure why).&nbsp; So to reduce the downside risk, the
investor used the proceeds from the sale of the calls to
buy the puts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the stock rises above $105, he will be forced to
sell his stock for $105 per share regardless of how high
it goes.&nbsp; But if the stock falls, he can always elect to
sell the shares for $95 per share.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint, the collar looks
like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/040.gif'>

<p>We are assuming this investor paid $100 per share for
the stock, sold the calls, and bought the puts for a
credit of $1.&nbsp; If the stock falls below $95, he will
exercise the put and receive $95 for a total profit of
$96 after taking into account the $1 credit.&nbsp; Bear in
mind that the investor paid $100 for the stock, so this
is still a $4 loss overall.</p>
<p>If the stock rises above $105, he will be assigned on
the short calls and be forced to sell the stock for
$105.&nbsp; With the $1 credit, this yields a profit of $106
for any stock price above $105.&nbsp; Because the investor
paid $100 for the stock, a $6 profit is made for any
stock price above $105.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is easier to view the profit and loss
diagram to take into account the cost of the stock.&nbsp; We
can view the above chart by subtracting out the $100
cost for the stock and see the true profits and losses
for all stock prices:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/041.gif'>

<p>If you read our section on &quot;Basic Spreads&quot; and
&quot;Synthetics,&quot; you may have noticed the above profit and
loss diagram looks very much like a bull spread.&nbsp; In
fact, the collar strategy is a synthetic bull spread.&nbsp;
Also, you may remember the three-sided position used by
market makers called a <i>conversion</i>.&nbsp; Because the
strike prices are unequal in this example, this strategy
is sometimes called a <i>split-price conversion</i>.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure why it is the same as a bull
spread, the following may help.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a
bull spread with the above positions would be long $95
call and short $105 call.</p>
<p>Collar = Long stock + long $95 put + short $105 call</p>
<p>Synthetically, the long $95 put = short stock + long
$95 call </p>
<p>So replace the long $95 put with short stock and long
$95 call as follows:</p>
<p>Collar = Long stock + (short stock + long $95 call) +
short $105 call</p>
<p>The long and short stock cancel out and you're left
with a long $95 call + short $105 call -- a bull spread.</p>
<h2>Collars for credits or debits?</h2>
<p>There are many investors who believe the best
strategy with collars is to execute them for credits.&nbsp;
After all, why not get paid to have the long put and
short call position?</p>
<p>Investors who believe this are not understanding
profit and losses with the total position.&nbsp; If you
execute a collar for a credit versus a debit with all
else the same, you will open the doors to a larger
loss.&nbsp; Once you understand synthetics, you will see you
are <u>paying</u> for the credit synthetically by
allowing a larger loss potential.&nbsp; This is not to say
that it is not a good strategy to execute for credits.
Just be sure that you understand the total picture, and
that it is in line with your expectations on the stock.&nbsp;
In other words, do not execute for credits if your
bigger concern is the downside risk of the stock.</p>
<p>Let's run through several examples to make sure you
understand it.</p>
<p>Corning (GLW) is currently trading for $59-3/4 with
the following option quotes for January (approximately 2
months to expiration):</p>

<h2>Same strike collars (Conversions)</h2>
<p>Say an investor buys 1,000 shares and sells 10 $60
calls and buys 10 $60 puts -- a collar with both strike
prices the same.&nbsp; If you read our section on synthetic
options, you will recognize this strategy as a <i>
conversion</i>.</p>
<p>The investor will pay $59-3/4 for the stock, receive
$8-1/2 for the call (the bid) and pay $8-3/4 (the ask)
for the put.&nbsp; The options (not counting commissions)
cost 1/4 point.&nbsp; The most this investor will gain on the
stock is 1/4 of a point if the stock rises above $60 at
expiration.&nbsp; But because it cost 1/4 to establish the
collar, there is no net gain from the position; it is
effectively locked at $60.</p>
<p>This investor is guaranteed to receive $60 at
expiration in two months.&nbsp; If the stock is above $60, he
will be assigned on the short calls and receive $60; if
it closes below $60, he will exercise the puts and
receive $60.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that the investor's cost basis is also raised
by 1/4 point.&nbsp; He paid $59-3/4 and paid 1/4 point for
the options for a total of $60.</p>
<p>What does this cost?&nbsp; If interest rates are roughly
5%, then $60 * 5% * 2 months (2/12 year)= 1/2 point.&nbsp;
So, strictly from a monetary standpoint, this collar is
not a good strategy, as it will cost you 1/2 point in
lost interest.&nbsp; Basically, this investor is buying stock
today for $60, and guaranteeing the sale in two months
at $60 for no money, as he will be losing out on
interest he could be earning if he just sold the stock
today.</p>
<p>Now, this may be a good strategy for someone who is
deferring a sale of stock.&nbsp; In the past, this was done
with a box position where the investor would short 1,000
shares against their long 1,000 effectively locking in
the current price, as did our collar trader above.&nbsp;
Recent tax law changes have effectively eliminated the
box position as a tax advantaged trade.&nbsp; But we can
still execute it synthetically.&nbsp; Notice that the trader
is long shares at an effective price of $60.&nbsp; The short
$60 call and long $60 put constitute a synthetic <u>
short</u> position.&nbsp; So the investor truly is long and
short the same stock -- a box position.&nbsp; This is exactly
why our trader will not profit -- or lose -- anything
from the above collar.</p>
<h2>Collars for credits</h2>
<p>Say our same investor, instead, chose to sell the $60
call for $8-1/2 but buy the $55 put for $6-3/8.&nbsp; Now, he
has a credit of $2-1/8 effectively, reducing the cost
basis on the stock by this amount to $57-5/8 ($59-3/4 -
$2-1/8 = $57-5/8).&nbsp; Notice, though, that his &quot;insurance&quot;
from the put doesn't start until $55, so he can still
lose $2-5/8 points (he pays $57-5/8 and sells for $55)
if he exercises these puts.&nbsp; This is what we were
referring to when we said traders who execute collars
for credits wind up paying for it by additional downside
risk.</p>
<p>The trader who executed the collar for a net zero had
no downside risk, but when executed for a credit, now
has a $2-5/8 risk.&nbsp; This is exactly why the market will
&quot;pay&quot; you credits for this type of collar.&nbsp; Effectively
this credit trader is assuming a &quot;deductible&quot; of
$2-5/8.&nbsp; Notice too that the market only paid him $2-1/8
for it.&nbsp; Again, the credit collars do not come for free.</p>
<p>This is a great strategy if the trader is very
fearful of downside risk below $55 yet willing to sell
his stock for $60.&nbsp; He will profit by the $2-1/8 credit
if the stock sits flat through expiration.</p>
<h2>Collars for debits</h2>
<p>Now let's assume the trader sells the $70 call for
$4-3/4 and buys the $60 put for $8 3/4 for a net debit
of $4.&nbsp; Now the cost basis on the stock is raised from
$59-3/4 to $63-3/4.&nbsp; In exchange, he can sell his stock
for $60 for a $3-3/4 loss, but may be forced to sell the
stock for $70 realizing a $6-1/4 profit.</p>
<p>This time, the trader is allowing a larger loss --
$3-3/4 instead of $2-5/8.&nbsp; Why did this happen when he
paid a debit to begin with?&nbsp; This is due to the fact
that the $70 out-of-the-money call was sold.&nbsp; The trader
wants more profit if the stock rises,&nbsp; because all else
being equal, all investors would rather have more profit
than not. The markets will effectively charge you for
that privilege.</p>
<p>Notice that <u>no</u> collar combination will prevent
a loss!&nbsp; This is due to the fact that the markets will
not assume the risk for free.&nbsp; If you buy the stock at
$59-3/4, no matter which combination of short calls and
long puts you choose, you must accept some downside risk
after accounting for the debits or credits from the
collar.&nbsp; If you buy the $60 put for $8-3/4, you just
bumped your cost basis to $68-1/2.&nbsp; True, you are
guaranteed to be able to sell your stock at $60 but this
leaves a loss of $8- 1/2 points.&nbsp; By selling calls
against the long put position, it will <u>lessen</u> the
expense of the put, but never to the point of no loss.&nbsp;
Even with the zero debit at-the-money collar we looked
at earlier, the trader still lost on foregone interest
and retained no upside potential in the stock.</p>
<p>The only time a collar can lock in a profit is if the
trader had purchased the stock previously at a lower
price, say, $50.&nbsp; With the above prices, he can now
execute a number of collars to guarantee a profit and
still leave upside potential.&nbsp; But this still doesn't
come for free either, as the trader was holding the
stock for some time and assuming <u>all</u> off the
downside risk.&nbsp; Now that the stock has moved in his
favor, he may be able to lock in gains with a collar.</p>
<p>This is when collars are especially attractive.&nbsp;
Consider using them when you have significant profits
especially if there is a big announcement such as
earnings that may cause the stock to plummet.&nbsp; The
collar can still yield healthy upside potential while
greatly reducing downside risk.</p>
<h2>Collar comparisons</h2>
<p>The following chart shows four of many possible
combinations of collars that could be constructed from
the above option quotes.&nbsp; There are two important things
to notice:&nbsp; (1) None of the collars prevent a loss, and
(2) The higher the debit, the <u>lower</u> the loss and
the <u>higher</u> the reward.&nbsp; This confirms what we
said earlier when it was noted that a trader who places
collars for credits is allowing for more downside risk.&nbsp;
Notice in the chart how the trader receiving the $6-5/8
credit has the lowest profit and highest loss.&nbsp; Again,
this does not mean that it is not a good strategy to
execute for credits.&nbsp; Just be sure you understand that
it does not come for free.</p>

<h2>Reverse equity collars</h2>
<p>We mentioned earlier that equity collars are actually
bull spreads.&nbsp; This allows the investor, in most cases,
to participate in additional upside in the stock as well
as reduce the downside exposure.&nbsp; What if the investor's
main concern is the downside?&nbsp; Is there a way to hedge
that portion in exchange for the upside gains?&nbsp; Yes, and
that is called a <i>reverse equity collar</i>.</p>
<p>In order to execute a reverse equity collar, one
needs only to buy the higher strike put and sell the
lower strike call -- an in-the-money collar.&nbsp; Notice
how, up until now, we have always purchased the put with
a lower strike, and sold a call with a higher strike.&nbsp;
This will always net a synthetic bull spread.&nbsp; If we
execute the reverse, we end up with a synthetic bear
spread.</p>
<p>Using the option quotes in the above box, let's
assume a trader buys stock at $59-3/4, buys the $65 put
for $11-5/8, and sells the $55 call for $11 for a net
debit of $5/8.&nbsp; The following chart shows the profit and
loss diagram for a reverse equity collar:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/043.gif'>

<p>Notice how the chart favors the downside; that is, it
becomees more profitable as the stock falls, which is
not the case with a regular collar.</p>
<p>Once again, this shows just how versatile options can
be, and why all investors should take the time to
understand them.</p>
<p>Collars are fairly complex in that they require three
positions.&nbsp; Most brokerage firms will require level 1
option approval level to place a collar and they can be
used in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).&nbsp; They
are fairly simple to understand once you become familiar
with them, and a powerful hedging tool to add to your
list of tactics.</p>
