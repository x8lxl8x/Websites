<h1>Option Approval Levels</h1>

<p>In order to trade options, your broker will
undoubtedly require you to fill out an options
application and assign you one of several option
approval levels based on your needs, knowledge, and
other factors, including net worth.</p>
<p>Often times people wonder why they must be approved
for options trading even though they may &quot;completely&quot;
understand the particular strategy they are trying to
execute.&nbsp; The reason is that there can be substantial
risks in options, especially from factors outside the
strategy.</p>
<p>For example, most people believe that the most you
can lose from a long call position is the amount of the
premium -- the amount you paid to buy it.&nbsp; While it is
true that a long call can never have negative value <i>
by itself</i>, the mechanics of the options markets do
allow for further losses if you do not understand them
as shown in the following example.</p>

<div align='left'>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>I actually witnessed this trade at a
brokerage firm.&nbsp; A trader was long 20 calls
at $4.&nbsp; In his mind, the most he could lose
was $8,000, which was the total paid for the
contracts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, if an equity option expires 3/4
of a point or more in-the-money, the Options
Clearing Corporation (OCC) will
automatically exercise the option for you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On the last trading day, the customer
thought the option would expire worthless,
as it was slightly out-of-the-money.&nbsp; A
small rally in the stock pushed it to just
over 3/4 of a point in-the-money at the
close.&nbsp; Because he did not close out the
option or contact his broker with
instructions to <i>not</i> exercise, the
option was automatically exercised and the
customer was long 2,000 shares on Monday
morning.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the stock opened
down 15 points on bad news and the customer
sold the stock at a $38,000 loss ($30,000
from the 15-point decline and $8,000 for the
cost of the option to acquire the stock!).</div>

<p>This is a perfect example of how large losses can
occur if you do not understand the strategies, risks and
mechanics of the options markets, and exactly why your
broker will require (or at least <i>should</i> require)
you to fill out an approval form.</p>
<p>Once you are approved, your broker will assign you
one of several option approval levels.&nbsp; While there is
no official standard, the following list should serve as
a general industry guideline as to the permissible
strategies under each level.&nbsp; Check with your broker for
specific details with their firm.</p>
<h2>Option approval levels</h2>
<p>There are usually four option approval levels
available through most brokerage firms.&nbsp; For whatever
reason, option levels are generally ranked from 0 to 3
although some firms do use 1 to 4.&nbsp; Level 0 is
considered to be a basic level and level 3 is the
highest.&nbsp; The levels are cumulative meaning that, for
any given level, all strategies below that level are
acceptable too.&nbsp; For example, all strategies allowed
under level 0 and level 1 will be allowed in under level
2.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the basic definitions and
strategies allowed under each level:</p>
<h2>Level 0</h2>
<h2>Covered calls</h2>
<p>Allows you to buy stock and write calls against it.</p>
<h2>Long protective puts</h2>
<p>Allows you to buy puts but only for a specific stock
and in the amounts you hold.&nbsp; For example, if you have
500 shares of INTC, you could purchase <u>up to</u> 5
put contracts to protect your position.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>Note:&nbsp; Some firms will allow index puts to provide
overall protection, especially for large accounts, where
buying puts on each position would be cost prohibitive.</i></p>
<h2>Short puts against short stock</h2>
<p>Allows the investor to sell puts if the stock is
short in the account.&nbsp; Careful, a lot of brokers will
tell you that short puts require level 3 but this is
considered to be covered (by the short stock) which is
why it is generally allowed in a level 0.&nbsp; If your
broker does not sound sure, have them check with a
manager.</p>
<p>This is generally the only level that will be
approved for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), <u>
but there are some firms that will allow level 1 in an
IRA.</u></p>
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h2>Long calls and puts</h2>
<p>Allows the outright purchase of a call or put.&nbsp; Level
0 also allows the purchase of a put too but only for
protective purposes.&nbsp; Level 1 allows you to <i>speculate</i>
that a stock or index will fall.</p>
<h2>Plus all strategies under level 0</h2>
<p>Note:&nbsp; There is a strategy called a &quot;rollup&quot; where
you sell one option and buy another.&nbsp; For example, you
may be long 10 $50 strike calls and the stock is now
trading at $60.&nbsp; One strategy is to sell the $50 strike
to <u>close</u> and buy the $60 strike to <u>open</u>.&nbsp;
You can send these orders as a spread to the market
maker in hopes of a better deal; after all, it is a
spread <i>order</i> as you are buying one option and
selling another.&nbsp; But it is not a spread <i>position</i>,
because once the order is executed, you will just be
long 10 $60 strikes; there will be no short positions in
the account.&nbsp; This is because one trade was to close and
the other to open.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful strategy and one discussed in
a later article.&nbsp; Just be careful if you use this
strategy in a level 1 account, that your broker doesn't
reject the trade becaues he thinks it's a level 2
transaction.</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h2>Spreads</h2>
<p>Allows the investor to buy and sell options as a
basic spread position with limited risk.&nbsp; So, the basic
bull and bear spreads and long calendar spreads (buy a
far month and sell a near month) will qualify.&nbsp; You
cannot have a short calendar spread (buy near month and
sell far month) or do ratio spreads (such as buy 10 $50
strikes and sell 20 $60 strikes) as this would expose
you to potentially unlimited losses.</p>
<h2>Plus all strategies under levels 1 and 0</h2>
<h2>Level 3</h2>
<h2>Uncovered (also called naked) positions</h2>
<p>This is the highest approval level and anything goes
-- as long as you have the equity to do it.&nbsp; Here, the
investor can sell a call or put with no corresponding
long or short position, respectively, to cover.&nbsp; Short
calendar spreads and ratio spreads are all approved.</p>
<h2>All strategies under levels 0, 1 and 2</h2>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Many investors like the strategy of naked
puts, as it is effectively a way to get paid to buy
stock you like.&nbsp; In order to do this, level 3 is
generally required.&nbsp; However, if you do not qualify for
level 3 and have a lot of equity (usually $500,000 or
more but entirely up to the brokerage firm) you may be
able to get approved for &quot;cash secured puts.&quot;&nbsp; The firm
will hold cash to the side assuming you will be
assigned.&nbsp; That way, the firm is protected under the
worst possible circumstances.&nbsp; I just mention this here
as many investors attempt approval for level 3 for the
sole purpose of naked puts, and are disappointed if they
do not get it.&nbsp; If this happens to you, you may want to
check to see if the brokerage firm will allow cash
secured puts. </p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are new to options, do not be concerned if
your broker does not give you the desired approval level
immediately.&nbsp; Often times they want to see some option
trading history before increasing your approval level.&nbsp;
For example, you may want to execute spread orders and
need to be approved for level 2.&nbsp; Your broker may
require you to start at level 0 or 1 and then increase
you to a higher level in six months or so with a
successful demonstration of option trading at the given
level.</p>
<p>Please understand that option approval levels exist
for a reason.&nbsp; If you are not immediately approved for
your desired level, there are plenty of option
strategies you can use with the level you receive.&nbsp;</p>
