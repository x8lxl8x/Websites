<h1>Backspread</h1>

<p>The backspread is similar to a ratio spread, except
that it has unlimited <i>profit</i> instead of unlimited
loss on the profit and loss diagram.&nbsp; It is the mirror
image of the ratio spread.&nbsp; In fact, the backspread is
often called a <i>long ratio spread</i>.</p>
<h2>Call backspread</h2>
<p>A call backspread involves the sale of a low strike
price call and the purchase of a higher number of
contracts at a higher price.&nbsp; For example, a trader may
sell 10 $50 calls and buy 20 $60 calls, also known as a
$50/$60 backspread.</p>
<p>The profit and loss diagram for a call backspread
looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/082.gif'>

<p>Assume the trader sells 10 $50 calls for $10 and buys
20 $60 calls for $3.&nbsp; This trade can be broken down to
10 (-1/2) spreads (please see our section on &quot;Ratio
Spreads&quot; for more information).&nbsp; In other words, the
trader sold one call and bought two calls, but did this
ten times.&nbsp; For every call sold at $10, two were
purchased at $3 for a total of $6.&nbsp; Therefore, the above
trade was executed for a net credit of $4 (received $10
but paid $6).&nbsp; Depending upon prices and ratios used,
backspreads may be entered for either debits or credits.</p>
<p>For any stock price below $50, the trader will keep
the net credit of $4, as both calls will expire
worthless.&nbsp; If the stock moves above $50, the trader
will head into loss territory because he is short these
calls.&nbsp; However, if the stock continues upward, the $60
calls will come to the rescue and stop the losses.&nbsp; The
maximum loss will occur at $60 where the trader will
lose ten points (the difference in strikes) less the
credit of $4, for a maximum loss of $6.&nbsp; Because there
are <u>two</u> $60 calls for every short $50, the trader
will start to make gains above $60.&nbsp; In order to make up
for the $6 loss, the stock must rise to $66 to reach
break-even.&nbsp; The downside break-even can be found in two
ways:&nbsp; One, the trader must make up the $6 loss from the
low point of $60;&nbsp; Or, he can sustain a loss of $4 (the
initial credit) above $50.&nbsp; Either way you choose, you
will see the downside break-even is $54.</p>
<p>Notice that if the trader had <i>purchased</i> the 10
$50 calls and <i>sold</i> 20 $60 calls, he would have a
ratio spread.&nbsp; Ratio spreads and backspreads are
opposites.&nbsp; The following is a profit and loss diagram
comparing the two spreads:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/083.gif'>

<h2>Why enter a call backspread?</h2>
<p>If a trader is bullish on a stock yet fears a market
turndown, then both sides of the market can be played
with a backspread.&nbsp; The trader will capture all upside
profits yet have a credit (or less of a loss if entered
as a debit) if the stock should fall.&nbsp; Typically, novice
traders will enter long straddles to play the upside and
downside.&nbsp; However, with long straddles, the break-even
points become very wide due to the fact that premiums
are paid for both the call and put and must be made up.&nbsp;
With the backspread, a trader can custom-tailor his bias
in the stock and create better risk-reward ratios.&nbsp; The
trader using a call backspread is more bullish, but
fears a downturn.&nbsp; He will not profit as much as a long
straddle trader, but does not have as much at risk
either.</p>
<p>Backspreads are another great example of just how
versatile options can be.</p>
<h2>Put backspread</h2>
<p>Backspreads can be used with put options too.&nbsp; To
enter a put backspread, the trader will sell a high
strike put and buy a higher number of a lower strike
put.&nbsp; For example, a trader may sell 10 $60 puts and buy
20 $50 puts.</p>
<p>The profit and loss diagram for a put backspread
looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/084.gif'>

<p>Assume the trader sells the $60 puts for $10 and buys
the $50 puts for $3.&nbsp; As above, this spread can be
broken down into 10 (-1/2) spreads.&nbsp; This means that for
every one put that was sold, two were purchased.&nbsp; The
trader receives $10 from the sale of the $60, but pays
$6 for the two $50 puts for a net credit of $4.&nbsp; If the
stock should rise, the trader is left with a credit, as
both puts will expire worthless.&nbsp; If the stock falls
below $60, the trader heads into loss territory, as he
is short these puts.&nbsp; If the stock continues to fall to
$50, the losses stop and gains will start, as he is long
two of the $50 puts for every one of the $60 puts that
are short.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So for any stock price below $50, the trader starts
to gain.&nbsp; At $50, the trader is down $10 (the difference
in strikes), but received $4 from the initial trade for
a net loss of $6.&nbsp; Because this $6 must be made up, the
break-even will be $6 points below the $50 strike or
$44.&nbsp; If the stock falls below $44, the trader will
start to show profits.&nbsp; Where is the upside break-even?&nbsp;
The trader will need to make up the $6 from the max loss
point at $50 to the upside; equally, he can sustain a $4
loss (the initial credit) below $60.&nbsp; Either way of
looking at it will yield an upside break-even of $56.</p>
<p>With puts, traders are betting more on the downside,
but they fear the upside risk.&nbsp; A put backspread allows
them to capture both possibilities while favoring the
position to the downside.</p>
<h2>Intel backspread example</h2>
<p>Let's run through an actual example using Intel
(INTC), which is currently trading around $41.&nbsp; The
option quotes are as follows:</p>
<p>Dec $40 Call =&nbsp;<b>Bid</b>:$3-1/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ask</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3-3/4<br>
Dec $45 Call =&nbsp;<b>Bid</b>:$1-3/8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ask</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1-3/4</p>
<p>Assume a trader wants to place a $40/$45 backspread
and sells the $40 call for $3-1/2 and buys 2 $45 calls
for $1-3/4 each or $3-1/2 for a net debit of zero shown
by:</p>
<p>Short 1 $40 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$3
1/2<br>
long 2 $45 calls at $1 3/4 each =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$3 1/2</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p>Here is what the profit and loss diagram will look
like for the above trade:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/085.gif'>

<p>The trader will make nothing if the stock falls, and
lose $5 if the stock closes at $45.&nbsp; If the stock is
above $45, the trader will start to recover losses and
eventually break even at $50.&nbsp; Any stock price above $50
will yield a profit.&nbsp; Note the break-even points of $40
and $50.&nbsp; If the stock closes between these two points,
the trader ends up with a loss.</p>
<p>Remember we said the trade opposite the backspread is
the ratio spread?&nbsp; Well, the floor trader who executes
the above backspread will have the ratio spread
(assuming the trades are not matched with other orders
or positions).&nbsp; The floor trader's profit and loss
diagram will look like this:</p>

<p>Backspreads are great tools; especially for active
traders.&nbsp; They generally require level 2 option approval
(ratio spreads require level 3).&nbsp; Many traders shy away
from ratio and backspreads because of the initial
complexity in understanding them.&nbsp; However, with a
little work, you can quickly find the maximum gain and
loss points as well as the break-evens.&nbsp; They are a
wonderful tool for option traders, so you should take
the time to understand them if you want advance to a
higher level of trading!</p>
