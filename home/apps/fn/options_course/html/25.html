<h1>Implied Volatility</h1>

<p>As you learn more about options, you will eventually
run into the term &quot;implied volatility.&quot;&nbsp; It is an
essential concept in option trading; in fact, many
strategies rely on &quot;volatility&quot; as opposed to
directional plays with the underlying stock.&nbsp; For
example, short straddles and calendar spreads are
volatility plays, as the long position does not want the
stock to move (or at least move very far).</p>
<p>Understanding implied volatility allows you to find
the best options to use, even if just a long or short
position.&nbsp; It will also allow you to understand why,
sometimes, the stock moves up but your long call moves
down which seems contradictory -- until you understand
implied volatility.</p>
<p>We'll take it slow, but you will understand implied
volatility when we're through.</p>
<h2>A little statistical background</h2>
<p>We will be using the term <i>standard deviation</i>
throughout, so we need to have a basic understanding of
what this means.&nbsp; Standard deviation is a statistical
measure telling you how likely it is that something <i>
deviates</i> from the average.&nbsp; We will not be doing the
exact calculations, but it is necessary to understand
the concept.</p>
<p>For example, the average adult male is about 5'9&quot;
tall.&nbsp; How often will we see one taller than 6'5&quot;?&nbsp; In
order to answer this, we need to know how the numbers
are distributed.&nbsp; One of the most popular distributions
is called a <i>normal distribution</i> or bell curve.&nbsp;
If we assume that the heights of adult males are
normally distributed and we have calculated the standard
deviation, then all we need to do is find where 6'5&quot;
falls on the bell curve.&nbsp; With a little math, we can
figure out how likely it is that we will see someone
6'5&quot; or taller. </p>
<p>With the standard bell curve, about 68% of the area
lies within one standard deviation, and about 95% lies
within two standard deviations.&nbsp; Essentially all
information lies within three standard deviations under
a bell curve.</p>
<h2>Volatility</h2>
<p>Before we attempt to explain <i>implied volatility</i>,
we should clarify what is meant by the term <i>
volatility</i>.&nbsp; Although we hear generic phrases like
&quot;that stock is volatile,&quot; it is actually a statistical
concept with a very precise meaning.&nbsp; <b>Volatility is
the annualized standard deviation of stock price
movements.</b></p>
<p>We'll show you what this means with an example:</p>
<p>Say there is a stock trading at $100 with a
volatility of 20%.</p>
<p>If we assume that stock prices are random, then about
68% of the time (or two out of three chances), the stock
will be between $80 and $120 after one year.&nbsp; This is
found by adding and subtracting 20% the volatility to
the $100 starting stock price.</p>
<p>Remember, this is <u>one</u> standard deviation from
the starting point of $100, so that, means that plus and
minus 20% will occur 68% of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>To continue, we would expect 95% of the time to see
the stock in one year trading between $60 and $140 (or
19 out of 20 chances).&nbsp; This was found by adding 2 *
20%, or two standard deviations from our initial price
of $100.&nbsp; Because 95% of the bell curve area lies within
two standard deviations, we expect to see the stock
within two standard deviations (between $60 and $140)
95% of the time.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem a little odd to make a statement
like &quot;95% of the time, the stock will be between $60 and
$140.&quot;&nbsp; After all, doesn't it make sense that it either
<u>will be</u> or <u>won't be</u> between these prices?&nbsp;
What we mean by this statement is that if the exact
conditions were to occur over and over many times, 95%
of the closing prices after one year would be between
$60 and $140.&nbsp; While it is true that after one year, the
stock either will or will not be between these prices,
we do not know that beforehand so we say &quot;95% of the
time it will be between these prices.&quot;</p>
<p>It should be intuitive that the higher the volatility
number, the wider the range of closing prices we would
expect to see after one year.&nbsp; For example, one would
expect a wider distribution of closing price
possibilities for a stock with 40% volatility versus
20%.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>The black-scholes option pricing model</h2>
<p>Now that we have a grasp as to what volatility means,
let's find out what implied volatility is all about.&nbsp; In
order to do that, we need to return to the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Model (please see our section under this
title if you need more information).</p>
<p>The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model is basically
an options calculator.&nbsp; It is similar to a car-payment
calculator where you may input the amount you are
financing, the interest rate, the term of the loan,
etc., and the result is your payment.&nbsp; Similarly, with
the Black-Scholes Model, you put in the five key factors
that affect an options price: stock price, exercise
price, risk-free rate of interest, volatility, and time
to expiration and out pops the price of the call
option.&nbsp; This is the price we would <i>expect</i> to see
the option trading for.</p>
<p>Let's look at this closely:</p>
<p>Stock price + exercise price + risk-free rate + <b>
volatility</b> + time = call option price</p>
<p>Say we want to find out the price of a 3-month, $100
call option.&nbsp; If we ask hundreds of investors for the
stock price, we should get the same answer.&nbsp; All they
have to do is look at the quote.&nbsp; The exercise price is
given and so is the time so we'll get exactly the same
answers there.&nbsp; While everybody may not return the exact
answer as to the risk-free interest rate, they should
all be very close.&nbsp; Further, interest rates do not
greatly affect option prices especially over a
three-month period.&nbsp; So 4 out of the 5 factors (all in
blue) are basically givens; that is, if we asked
hundreds of people for these four pieces of information
(stock price, exercise price, risk-free rate, time to
expiration), we should get exactly the same answers
(allowing for a slight variation in the risk-free
interest rate).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now for volatility.&nbsp; What should these hundreds of
investors tell us is the correct volatility to use?&nbsp;
Some may say the historic volatility is 20%, so let's
use that figure.&nbsp; Others may say the historic is 20%,
but the stock has been at 30% volatility over the past
month, so let's use that.&nbsp; Still, others may say it has
been 30% recently, but they feel it will be higher so we
should use 35%.</p>
<p>The point is that the only true <u>unknown</u> factor
of the Black-Scholes Model is volatility, and that's why
it is so important to understand.&nbsp; It is the one
variable that determines option prices! </p>
<p>Let's run through an example with actual numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$4.61</p>
<p>Stock price + exercise price + risk-free rate + <b>
volatility</b> +&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call option price</p>
<p>If we actually run the above numbers through a
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model we find the $100 call
option should be trading for $4.61.</p>
<p>BUT, let's say we look at the option quote and it is
actually quoting $5 1/2.&nbsp; In this case, the call option
price becomes a given; our hypothetical hundred traders
would all return this same value as well.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Implied volatility</h2>
<p>Something must be out of balance as 20% volatility
returns a call price of $4.61, yet we see it quoting
$5-1/2.&nbsp; The only term we can adjust on the left hand
side of the equation is volatility (red) as all the
other factors (blue) are givens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now the question becomes, what volatility will
produce an option price of $5-1/2 with all the other
factors the same?&nbsp; If we go back to the Black-Scholes
Model, we can try different volatilities until we come
up with a price of $5-1/2.&nbsp; If we do, we see the
volatility that makes the equation true (that is, the
call option price $5-1/2) is 24.6%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We would say the <i>implied volatility</i> of the
option is 24.6%.&nbsp; This means the market is telling us it
feels the <u>forward volatility</u> or <u>future
volatility</u> of this stock over the next 90 days is
about 25% and not the historical 20% we had observed
earlier.&nbsp; In fact, this is one of the main benefits of
an options market; it allows a window in which to
monitor the opinion of the market.</p>
<h2>Trading volatility</h2>
<p>One of the main tactics of option traders is trading
volatility.&nbsp; In order to understand why, we need one
more statistical concept known as <i>mean reversion</i>.&nbsp;
While this sounds intimidating, it's really very simple;
it suggests that many types of data revert back to the
mean.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, if you flip a coin many times, you would
expect to have &quot;heads&quot; land 50% of the time.&nbsp; Now, it
shouldn't shock anybody if, after the first ten flips to
see 7 heads and 3 tails -- a 70% hit rate.&nbsp; But if you
keep flipping, that will eventually revert closer to a
mean of 50%.&nbsp; In other words, on average, the averages
win!</p>
<p>The same holds true for options and has been proven
in many studies.&nbsp; For example, if a stock has an
historic volatility of 20% but the markets are trading
it with a volatility of 30% (implied volatility), then
on average, we should expect to see the volatility
revert to the mean of 20%.&nbsp; What happens to calls or
puts when the volatility falls?&nbsp; The price comes down as
well.&nbsp; The reverse is true, too.&nbsp; If implied volatility
rises, so will the prices of calls and puts.</p>
<p>So as a whole, traders tend to buy options with low
implied volatility hoping that the volatility reverts to
the higher average and increases in price.&nbsp; Likewise,
they tend to sell options with high implied volatility
hoping the premiums deflate as they fall to the historic
means. </p>
<h2>Volatility trap</h2>
<p>Now we may be able to shed some light as to why
sometimes the call you hold falls in price even though
the stock rises.&nbsp; This happens to puts as well.&nbsp; You may
see the stock fall, yet have your put decline in value.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Say you are interested in a stock trading at $50 that
has an historic volatility of 25% and is about to
announce earnings.&nbsp; You feel they will have a record
quarter and great comments from the analysts, so you
decide to buy 10 $50 calls.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now think about this.&nbsp; You are probably not the only
investor who had the same thought.&nbsp; You very likely
deduced this from current information and recent
comments from the company or analysts.&nbsp; <i>So the entire
market is probably doing the same thing.&nbsp; </i>By acting
on this information, the price of the calls keeps
getting bid higher and higher.&nbsp; Let's say it is bid up
to an implied volatility of 40% instead of the historic
25%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You buy your call option with very high implied
volatility (remember, options with high implied
volatilities are the ones professional traders look to
sell).&nbsp; The stock releases great numbers and comments
from the analysts and is now up 2 points.&nbsp; But your
option is now being priced with a volatility of closer
to 25%.&nbsp; Why, there are no new buyers speculating for a
good earnings release; it's now old information.&nbsp;
According to the Black-Scholes Model, you will get a
two-point increase in the stock price but a 15% decrease
in volatility, which can leave you holding an option
that is <u>down</u> in price even though the stock is
up.&nbsp; This phenomenon is called a <i>volatility trap</i>.</p>
<p>Be careful when buying or selling options.&nbsp; Check
with your broker to see what the implied volatilities
are relative to the historic levels.&nbsp; If they cannot get
this for you, you should consider finding one that can,
as the information can be crucial for winning option
trades.</p>
<p>Learn to use the tactics professionals use to put the
odds on their side.&nbsp; If you are selling calls, perhaps
even a covered call, you should check the implied
volatilities.&nbsp; If the implied volatility is high, this
is one more piece of information suggesting the odds are
on your side.&nbsp; If you want to buy an option, check to
see if the implied volatilities are low and if it will
tilt the odds in your favor, assuming your assumptions
about the underlying stock are correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please note that buying an option with high implied
volatilities or selling one with low implied
volatilities is not necessarily wrong.&nbsp; It's just that
you have now added another dimension stacked against
you.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>How volatile is the market?</h2>
<p>One way to monitor the overall volatility of the
market is with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
indicator called the VIX (volatility index) and can be
quoted under that same symbol.&nbsp; The VIX was created in
1993 and calculated by taking a weighted average of the
<i>implied volatilities</i> of eight S&amp;P 100 (OEX) calls
and puts.&nbsp; The options have an average time to maturity
of 30 days, so the VIX is intended to indicate the
implied volatility of 30-day index options.</p>
<p>Learn to interpret and use implied volatilities in
your trading.&nbsp; It will open your eyes to a new way of
trading options and add a new list of strategies to
implement.</p>
