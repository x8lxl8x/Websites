<h1>Ratio Spreads</h1>

<p>Ratio spreads are a very powerful strategy and can be
done with calls or puts.&nbsp; In theory, they are probably
the perfect trade as they provide for buying the
valuable options and selling off higher amounts of the
&quot;worthless&quot; options to finance the long position.&nbsp; But
they do come with great risks to the tune of unlimited
losses at an accelerated rate if the stock moves above
the strike of the short position.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The mirror image of the ratio spread is the
backspread.&nbsp; If you place a ratio spread, the trader on
the other side has a backspread.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Call ratio spreads</h2>
<p>A call ratio spread consists of buying a lower strike
call and then selling a higher number of contracts of a
higher strike price.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>A trader is bullish on MRVC currently trading
$37-3/4.&nbsp; The trader thinks the stock will go above $40
by December but not above $50.&nbsp; A ratio spread, under
these circumstances, may be a perfect strategy:</p>
<p>Buy 10 Dec $40 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5 1/4<br>
Sell 20 Dec $50 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 1/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3/4</p>
<p>We have arbitrarily chosen the ratio of 10 and 20
(buying 10 and selling 20).&nbsp; The trader could have
bought 10 and sold 11, or bought 50 and sold 150, or any
other ratio among the infinite combinations.&nbsp; We will
see shortly why a trader will choose one ratio over
another.</p>
<p>First, we need to understand how we arrived at a net
debit of $3/4 in the above trade.</p>
<p>There are two fairly easy ways to figure this out,
and whichever one works for you is fine.&nbsp; The first and
probably best way to understand the ratio spread is to
break the trade up into the smallest component parts.&nbsp;
To do this, we need to find the highest number that is
common to the 10 calls we're buying and the 20 we're
selling (in math terms, the greatest common factor).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The highest number, in this case, is 10; there is no
number higher than 10 that can go into both 10 and 20
evenly.&nbsp; If we divide the buy 10 and sell 20 calls by
our greatest common factor, we arrive with buy 1 call
and sell 2, a basic unit.&nbsp; The trader in the above
example is just executing this basic spread 10 times.</p>
<p>In other words, he could call his broker and say,
&quot;Buy 1 and sell 2, Buy 1 and sell 2, Buy 1 and sell
2...&quot;&nbsp; The trader could repeat this order 10 times and,
in the end, would have purchased 10 and sold 20.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In trader's jargon, this person executed 10 1 by 2
spreads which is usually written as 10 (1 x -2) spreads.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Examples:</b><p><b>If a trader:</b><br>
buys 7 and sells 21:&nbsp; This is 7 (1 x -3) spreads<br>
buys 3 and sells 7:&nbsp; This is 1 (3 x -7) spread<br>
buys 16 and sells 24: &nbsp;This is 8 (2 x -3)
spreads</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now that we know the basic unit is 1 by 2, let's look
at the above trade again.&nbsp; Effectively the trader has
done this:</p>
<p>Buy 1 Dec $40 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5 1/4<br>
Sell 2 Dec $50 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 1/4</u></p>
<p>The trader purchases 1 for $5-1/4 and sells 2 for a
total of 2 * $2 1/4 = $4-1/2.&nbsp; They paid $5-1/4 and
received $4-1/2 for a net debit of $3/4.</p>
<p>The second method may be a little easier:</p>
<p>Buy 10 $40 calls for $5 1/4 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$5,250<br>
Sell 20 $50 calls for $2 1/4 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$4,500</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$750</p>
<p>The trader buys 10 calls for a total of $5,250 and
sells 20 for a total of $4,500.&nbsp; The net difference is
$750.&nbsp; Because he is trading 10 spreads (yes, you still
have to be able to break it down into component parts!),
we need to divide $750 by 1,000 (because 10 contracts
represent 1,000 shares) for a net debit of $3/4 per
spread.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Important note</b>:&nbsp; It is very important
to understand how to calculate these figures if
you are executing a ratio spread, because it is
a complex strategy and will require level 3
option approval.&nbsp; If your broker calculates this
incorrectly, they <u>may</u> hold you either
partially or fully liable for the trade.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because on the options application you will have
to check the box designating &quot;excellent&quot;
knowledge to get level 3, and they may hold you
to this.&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now we know the trader is trying to execute 10 (1 x
-2) spreads for a net debit of $3/4.&nbsp; The total debit
from his account will be 1,000 * $3/4 = $750.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Can the market maker fill only part of the trade?</h2>
<p>Yes, but not just arbitrarily.&nbsp; Because the minimum
spread, in this example, is 1 by 2, the floor trader
could give your broker a confirmation of buy 1 sell 2,
buy 2 sell 4, buy 3 sell 6, and so on up to the total of
buy 10 and sell 20.&nbsp; They could not, for example, return
a confirm of buy 2 sell 20.&nbsp; It will always have to be a
multiple of the basic unit, which is 1 by 2 for this
trade.</p>
<p>An &quot;all-or-none&quot; restriction will prevent partial
fills but are generally inadvisable, as option quotes
are good for a minimum of 20 contracts.&nbsp; If you put an
&quot;all-or-none&quot; restriction on the order, it is possible
to get no execution, and you cannot hold the floor to
time and sales.&nbsp; So use &quot;all-or-none&quot; orders sparingly
and it's probably best to never use all-or-none's for
orders of 20 contracts or less.</p>
<p>Let's assume our trader gets filled on all 10 (1 x
-2) spreads and spends $750 to do so.&nbsp; What does the
position look like from a profit and loss standpoint?
(If you are unsure how to read these charts, please see
our section under &quot;Profit and Loss Diagrams.&quot;)</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/053.gif'>

<p>We see that the trader will lose the entire $3/4 per
spread, or $750, if the stock is below $40 at
expiration.&nbsp; The trader will maximize profits at $50,
the strike price of the short position.&nbsp; What will be
the max profit?&nbsp; The maximum this spread can be worth is
$10, the difference in strikes; however, the trader paid
$3/4, so the max profit will be $10 - $3/4 = $9 1/4.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It is easy to see where the danger is with the ratio
spread; there is unlimited upside risk.&nbsp; The trader will
start to lose profit with the stock above $50 at
expiration, and will break-even at $40-3/4 and $59-1/4.&nbsp;
The downside break-even is simple to figure; the trader
paid $3/4 for the position, so he must make this up.&nbsp; If
the stock is at $40-3/4 at expiration, the long call
position will be worth $3/4 and the short position will
expire worthless, so the trader will break even.</p>
<p>It can be a little tough to figure the break-even on
the upside, so we'll spend some time here.&nbsp; For all the
math people, one easy way to figure it is to understand
that the slope will be negative one due to the 1:2 ratio
of the spread.&nbsp; With a slope of negative one, the stock
must move 9-1/4 points (the max profit) to the right of
$50 (the stock price at max profit), which puts you at a
stock price of $59-1/4.&nbsp; This method does require a
solid understanding of graphs and slopes so do not use
it if this does not make sense to you.&nbsp; I only mention
for those who do understand mathematical slopes, as it
is easy to calculate in your head if you do.&nbsp; As an
example, if the trader entered a $40/$50 1 by 3 ratio
spread for a net debit of $3/4, the break-even point to
the upside would occur at twice the rate; a slope of
negative 2.&nbsp; Now, instead of moving 9-1/4 points to the
right, the stock will only have to move half this
distance or $4-5/8 for a break-even price of $54-5/8.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, especially if you are new to
ratio spreads, the following method will be the best,
but does require basic skills in algebra.&nbsp; Start by
understanding that the definition of break-even is where
revenues equal expenses, so:</p>
<p>If we let S represent the stock price at expiration,
</p>
<p>Our profits will be (S - $40), because we will have
intrinsic value of this amount on the long position.&nbsp;
Our expenses will be 2* (S - $50) - $3/4.&nbsp; This is
because we sold two contracts for every one purchased
and they will have S - $50 for value which is a
liability to us.&nbsp; In addition, we spent $3/4 for the
trade, which is also an expense.&nbsp; Now put the two
equations equal to each other and solve:</p>
<p>S - $40 = 2 * (S - $50) - $3/4<br>
S - $40 = 2S - $100 - $3/4 </p>
<p>After collecting all like terms to one side, we see S
= $59-1/4.</p>
<p>If you understand nothing about the break-even point
to the upside, at least understand this<b>:&nbsp; there is <u>
unlimited risk</u> to the upside in a call ratio
spread!&nbsp; The larger the ratio, the more accelerated the
losses become.</b></p>
<h2>Why enter a call ratio spread?</h2>
<p>This is a popular tool among floor traders and there
are good reasons it is well liked.&nbsp; The basic reason is
this: it allows the trader to buy the &quot;good&quot; option
cheaply by financing it with the &quot;junk&quot; option -- the
one he feels will never have intrinsic value.&nbsp; By doing
so, the return on investment is radically magnified.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Assume our trader above was bullish and just bought
10 calls of the $40 strike with two months to
expiration.&nbsp; He would have paid $5-1/4 per contract or
$5,250.&nbsp; Let's also assume the stock closes at $50 --
our trader's expectation -- at expiration.&nbsp; This
position would be worth 10 points on 10 contracts for a
total of $10,000; however, the trader will net $4,750
after costs.&nbsp; The return on investment is roughly
90-1/2% or 4,675% annualized!</p>
<p>Now let's look at our trader who entered the ratio
spread.&nbsp; Effectively, he is buying the 10 $40 strike
contracts for only $3/4 of a point instead of the $5-1/4
of the long call trader.&nbsp; Of course, this does not come
for free, as the ratio trader is faced with unlimited
risks to the upside; the long trader would simply make
more money as the stock moves higher.&nbsp; Assuming the
trader's assumption that the stock will not rise (or at
least significantly) above $50, let's see how the ratio
spread fares:</p>
<p>Buy 10 Dec $40 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5 1/4<br>
Sell 20 Dec $50 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 1/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3/4</p>
<p>Again, assuming the stock closes at $50, this trader
will also make $10 points on the spread, as the short
$50 calls will expire worthless.&nbsp; The return on
investment here is 1,233% or 561,865,400%</p>
<p>You can certainly see where the incentive is to trade
ratios!&nbsp; Be careful, the market does not allow for these
returns for nothing.&nbsp; The ratio spreader took a
proportionately higher risk to capture that kind of
profit.</p>
<h2>Why would a trader enter a different ratio?</h2>
<p>We have demonstrated the advantage of the ratio
spread,which is magnified gains if you are correct in
your assumptions.&nbsp; If the trader feels really sure about
his assumptions and is willing to take the risk, he may
decide to enter into a larger ratio.&nbsp; Let's run through
the above example again, but this time, assume the
trader enters a 1:3 ratio spread.</p>
<p>Buy 10 Dec $40 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5 1/4<br>
Sell 30 Dec $50 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 1/4</u><br>
Net Credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1 1/2</p>
<p>This trader actually gets a credit from the net
transactions, effectively getting paid to take the 10
long $40 strike calls.&nbsp; Again, do not be fooled into
thinking it comes for free!</p>
<p>How did we figure the credit?&nbsp; The trader bought 1
for - $5-1/4 and sold 3 for a total of + $6- 3/4 for a
net of $1-1/2 credit per spread.</p>
<p>We know he bought 10 (1 x -3) spreads for a total
credit of $1,500.&nbsp; By the way, this is still considered
a buy even though a credit is received.&nbsp; This is because
the trader wants the spread to widen.</p>
<p>The profit and loss diagram looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/054.gif'>

<p>It is now easy to see the differences.&nbsp; As the number
of sells increases relative to the buys, the profit and
loss diagram will shift upward as in the 1:3 ratio (red)
compared to the 1:2 (blue).&nbsp; That's the good part; the
long position gradually becomes cheaper to own, and the
trader will receive a credit if enough of the short
calls are sold.&nbsp; Now for the downside, as more are sold,
the downside break-even point approaches much more
rapidly, which means you head into losses at a faster
rate.</p>
<p>For the 1:3 spread, the trader received a credit of
$1-1/2 so there is no downside breakeven.&nbsp; The trader
will have a $1-1/2 profit even if the stock collapses.&nbsp;
The maximum gain is the 10 points on the spread plus the
$1-1/2 received, for a total of $11-1/2.</p>
<p>As for the upside break-even point, (for the math
people again) we know the slope is negative 2, so the
$11-1/2 maximum gain will fall at twice the rate or
$5-3/4.&nbsp; So if the stock price is $55 3/4 at expiration,
this trader will be at break even.</p>
<p>Algebraically, our revenues at expiration are:<br>
S-$40 + $1-1/2</p>
<p>And the expenses are:<br>
3 * (S-$50)</p>
<p>Putting these two equal to each other:<br>
S - $40 + $1-1/2 = 3 * (S-$50)<br>
S - $40 + $1-1/2 = 3S - $150<br>
2S = $111.50<br>
S = $55-3/4</p>
<p>If you want to check it, assume the stock is at $55
3/4 at expiration.&nbsp; The long calls will be worth +$15
3/4 (intrinsic value) and the short calls with be worth
3 * $5-3/4 = $17-1/4 which is a liability because it is
a short position.&nbsp; So, the trader has +$15- 3/4 and -
$17-1/4 for a net loss of $1-1/2 which exactly offsets
the $1-1/2 credit received at the onset of the position.</p>
<p>The real risk to the trader is if the call ratio
trader is if the stock makes a large move to the upside,
especially between trading sessions.&nbsp; For example, the
trader in the above trade could be holding the position
with the stock now at $48.&nbsp; The next trading day, the
stock opens at $60 and continues trading higher.&nbsp; In
this instance, the trader never has a chance to get out
of the position until large losses have occurred.&nbsp; Floor
traders will generally close them out long before the
risk gets too great, and if the stock collapses, often
end up with a credit from the trade.</p>
<h2>Ratio spreads with puts</h2>
<p>Ratio spreads can be established with puts as well.&nbsp;
A put ratio spread allows the investor to play the
downside for much less money then either a long position
or regular spread position.</p>
<p>To establish a ratio spread with puts, the trader
will buy one strike price and sell a higher number of
contracts of a <u>lower</u> strike price.</p>
<p>Assume a trader is bearish and we have the following
quotes on MRVC:</p>
<p>Buy 10 Dec $40 puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$7 1/2<br>
Sell 20 Dec $30 puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 3/8</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2 3/4</p>
<p>The trader effectively buys 10 $40 strike puts for
$2-3/4 instead of $7-1/2.</p>
<p>The profit and loss diagram looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/055.gif'>

<p>We see, as expected, that the put ratio spread is
exactly opposite the of the call ratio spread.&nbsp; Here,
that maximum gain is at the strike price of the short
$30 put.&nbsp; At this point, the spread will be worth $10 to
the trader for a net of $7-1/4 after the $2-3/4 cost is
subtracted.&nbsp; Below $30, the trader starts to lose
profits and hits break-even at $22-3/4.&nbsp; If the stock
should fly to the upside, the maximum the trader can
lose is the original $2-3/4.</p>
<p>Ratio spreads are a wonderful tool for trading.&nbsp; The
spreads can all be custom-tailored to suit your specific
needs and sentiment of the underlying stock.&nbsp; They can,
depending on how they're used, have substantial risks
and will require the use of naked options approval
(usually level 3 for most firms) from your broker.</p>
<p>Practice doing &quot;paper trades&quot; if you're new to ratio
spreads, as they will greatly improve your understanding
of options, strategies, and position management
techniques.</p>
