<h1>Leverage</h1>

<p>You have probably heard that one of the biggest
advantages of trading options is leverage.&nbsp; By leverage
we mean that for a given percentage change in the stock,
the option will increase by a larger percentage, thus
leveraging, or magnifying, the return on investment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For example, say a stock is trading for $100 and a
$100 call is trading for $5.&nbsp; If the stock closes at
$115 at expiration, a 15% move, the option will be worth
$15, a 200% move.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One way to view this leverage is to realize that the
option trader, in this example, has leveraged the
returns by a factor of twenty.&nbsp; In other words, for
every 100 shares the stock investor buys ($10,000
worth), the option buyer can buy 20 contracts ($10,000 /
$500 per option = 20).&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the stock trader invested $10,000, it would grow
by 15% to a value of $10,000 * (1.15) = $11,500, or a
profit of $1,500.&nbsp; The option trader's account will be
worth $10,000 x 200% increase= $30,000.&nbsp; If we multiply
the profit of the stock trader, $1,500, by 20, we end up
with $30,000, which is the value of the option trader's
position.&nbsp; In this example, the option trader's total
account value will always be worth 20 times the stock
trader's profit, assuming the $100 call option has
intrinsic value.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Gearing</h2>
<p>The leverage described above is known as <i>gearing,
</i>and is actually just an old British term that means
leverage.&nbsp; It is not uniquely defined, but the two most
common definitions are (1) The <i>stock</i> price
divided by the option price or (2) The <i>strike</i>
price, divided by the option price.</p>
<p>Using definition 1, the way to find it is to simply
divide the stock price by the option price:</p>
<h2>Gearing = stock price / option price</h2>
<p>In our example, the stock was $100 and the option was
$5, so $100/$5 = 20.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is just another way of saying the stock trader
required twenty times the amount of capital to control
the same amount of shares.</p>
<p>Using the second definition, gearing would be:</p>
<h2>Gearing = strike price / option price</h2>
<p>This gives the same answer of 20.&nbsp; But what if the
strike was $110?&nbsp; Now the gearing is $110/$5 = 22.&nbsp; In
this way, the option trader may pay $110 for the stock
but is controlling it for $5, so is leveraged by a
factor of 22.</p>
<h2>Omega</h2>
<p>There is another term you may encounter that
describes leverage and is called <i>omega</i>.&nbsp; Omega
measures the relative percentage changes between the
stock and the option -- called an <i>elasticity</i>
measure.&nbsp; For instance, assume the call in the above
example has a delta of 1/2.&nbsp; With the stock at $100 and
the call at $5, if the stock were to move $1 (a 1% move)
the call will move roughly 1/2 point for a 10%
increase.&nbsp; Because the option moved 10 times faster
relative to the stock (10% compared to 1%), the
elasticity, or omega, is 10.</p>
<p>Omega&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Delta / option price</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 / stock price</p>
<p>This can also be written:&nbsp; (stock price / option
price) * delta</p>
<p>Using the above formula in our example, we have a
$100 stock price divided by a $5 call option with delta
of 1/2, so:</p>
<p>&nbsp; $100/$5 * 1/2 = 10</p>
<p>Regardless of which measure you use, the higher the
leverage the more speculative the position.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that option traders should
invest in the equivalent share amount as they would a
stock purchase, and not the equivalent dollar amount.&nbsp;
For example, the trader above invested $10,000 on 100
shares.&nbsp; If he elected to use the call option instead,
it is advisable to purchase one contract representing
100 shares as opposed to buying $10,000 worth of the $5
option or 20 contracts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The reason is due to the leverage.&nbsp; If a trader is
not used to dealing in 2,000 share orders (20
contracts), the leverage and losses can become too great
too fast.&nbsp; By using share equivalents, the stock and
option positions will behave similarly and not leave the
trader with losses he was not prepared to take.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Leverage can be a very powerful -- and destructive --
tool.&nbsp; If you understand the various ways to measure
leverage, it will make you more comfortable with your
option picks and strategies! </p>
