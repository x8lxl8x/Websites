<h1>Deep-in-the-Money Covered Calls</h1>

<p>Many investors are aware of the covered call
strategy; in fact, it is the first option strategy most
encounter.&nbsp; The strategy involves buying stock and then
selling a call against it.&nbsp; This position is considered
covered, because no matter how high the stock moves, the
trader will always be able to deliver the stock in the
event of an assignment from the short call.&nbsp; If the
stock rises, you may be forced to sell your stock, and
if not, you keep the premium from the option sale.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It can certainly be a great strategy for an investor
who would hold the stock whether options traded on it or
not.&nbsp; In other words, as long as the investor is willing
to assume the downside risk of the stock, covered calls
can provide income and provide small downside hedges.</p>
<p>Most traders entering covered call positions buy the
stock and then sell a strike <u>above</u> the current
stock price.&nbsp; For example, they may buy stock at $50 and
then sell a $55 or higher strike call.&nbsp; Because these
calls are out-of-the-money, they do not carry much time
premium, so they don't provide much of a downside hedge
if the stock falls.&nbsp; Falling stock prices, not rising as
some think, are the risk of a covered call.&nbsp; Covered
calls constructed with out-of-the-money calls are more
of a revenue generating strategy than a risk reducing
strategy.</p>
<h2>Deep-in-the-money covered calls</h2>
<p>We would like to introduce you to a variation of the
covered call strategy, one that utilizes
deep-in-the-money calls.&nbsp; For example, a trader buys
stock at $50 but sells a $40 strike call.&nbsp; Now, I know
some of you are thinking, &quot;Wait a minute, why would I
want to buy stock at $50 and give someone else the right
to buy it for $40?&nbsp; That's a guaranteed loss!&quot;</p>
<p>It is exactly this thinking that keeps most beginning
option traders from using deep-in-the-money calls
against stock.&nbsp; The piece of the puzzle they are missing
is the <i>time premium</i> of the call option.&nbsp; The $40
call in the above example may be selling for, say, $11.&nbsp;
So even though it appears you may be taking a 10-point
loss at expiration, the call <u>buyer</u> is paying for
that up front.&nbsp; This $40 call has $10 intrinsic value
and $1 point of time premium.&nbsp; It is the $1 time premium
that the deep-in-the-money call writer is trying to
capture.&nbsp; Deep-in-the-money call writers intend to have
the stock called.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the option is trading at parity (all intrinsic
value and no time premium), then deep-in-the-money calls
certainly would not be a good strategy.&nbsp; For example, if
the $40 call is trading for exactly $10 (trading at
parity), by entering the covered call position, you are
buying the stock for effectively $40 (buying stock at
$50 and selling the call for $10), then selling your
stock at a later date for $40.&nbsp; Effectively, you are
giving up the interest on $40 through option expiration
and paying two commissions to do so!&nbsp; Clearly, options
trading at parity are not a winning strategy for covered
calls.</p>
<p>But as long as there is time premium on the
deep-in-the-money call, the strategy changes. &nbsp;Now the
deep-in-the-money call writer is putting the odds on
their side that they will get assigned and be forced to
sell the stock <i>in exchange for the time premium</i>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What makes this strategy appealing is that you are,
in most cases, receiving a high rate of return <u>and</u>
getting a huge downside hedge.&nbsp; You are getting the best
of both worlds.</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong and think you will be
overcompensated for the strategy.&nbsp; The markets will
price them according to the relative risks involved.&nbsp;
But if you are using this strategy on stock you like
regardless, you will probably find this strategy to be
one of the most appealing, especially when you see the
balance between returns and downside protection.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Extreme Networks (EXTR) is currently trading for $53
5/8.&nbsp; The December options with 16 days to expiration
are quoted as follows:</p>

<p>Say you buy the stock at $53-5/8 and sell a
deep-in-the-money call such as the $45 strike.&nbsp; The net
cost to you is:</p>
<p>Buy stock =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$53 5/8<br>
Sell $45 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$10 5/8</u><br>
Net cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$43</p>
<p>Effectively you are buying stock at $43 and putting
the odds heavily on your side that you will sell it for
$45.&nbsp; In fact, because the delta is currently 0.70, the
markets are saying there is now a 70% chance the sale
will occur.&nbsp; If that happens, you earned 2 points (time
premium) as interest on a $43 investment <i>for only 16
days of time</i>.&nbsp; That's a simple return of 4.65%, an
annualized return of over 106%, and an effective
compounded return of over 178%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So far so good.&nbsp; Now let's look at the downside
hedge.&nbsp; Because you received $10-5/8 for the call, the
stock can fall by this amount and you'd just be at
break-even.&nbsp; With the stock trading at $53-5/8, it could
fall to $43 for nearly a 20% downside hedge!&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the stock is above $45 at expiration, you make an
annualized rate of 178%; if it's down to $45, you're at
break-even.&nbsp; It's tough to beat, especially if it's a
stock you don't mind holding, and you're willing to
assume the downside risk.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many ways to use the strategy.&nbsp;
Maybe you're not so concerned with the downside risk and
want more upside return.&nbsp; You may elect to sell the
$47-1/2 or $50 strikes instead.&nbsp; If you're more
concerned with downside risk, you may go for sale of the
$42-1/2 strike with $1-5/8 time premium.</p>
<p>You should now see the benefits of using
deep-in-the-money calls compared to the usual
out-of-the-money calls used by most traders.&nbsp; Using the
above quotes, many would be inclined to sell the $60
calls.&nbsp; While that will yield a whopping 20.3% simple
return and 6,397% compounded return if the stock is
above $60 at expiration, it only gives $3-3/4 points or
6.8% downside hedge.&nbsp; Further, those returns are
realized <i>if</i> the stock is above $60 -- there is a
huge chance that it will not be.&nbsp; The out-of-the-money
call strategies are, for most investors,
disproportionately stacked with upside returns in
relation to their downside hedge.</p>
<h2>Why does this strategy work?</h2>
<p>If you are still not clear as to why this strategy
works, think about the following analogy:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Say you have a used car for sale for $20,000.&nbsp; A
buyer comes to you with the following offer: he will
give you $15,000 now and the balance in 3 months.&nbsp; If
you take the offer, you are effectively loaning $5,000
to the buyer.&nbsp; Therefore, the only way you should accept
the offer is to take additional money (interest) above
the $5,000 payment that he will owe you in 3-months.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Notice the similarity with the deep-in-the-money
covered call strategy above.&nbsp; The buyer (long call
position) is offering to buy your stock for $53-5/8.&nbsp;
Instead of giving you the full amount up front, he will
pay you $10-5/8 now and the balance in 16 days
effectively borrowing $43.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You are not taking a loss by purchasing stock at
$53-5/8 and selling it for $45 any more than you are
taking a loss by giving someone the right to buy your
$20,000 car for $5,000.&nbsp; In both cases, the buyer is
paying part of that future obligation now and paying you
<i>interest</i>&nbsp; (time premium on the option) to float
the balance.&nbsp; If the interest rate is appealing to you,
you will take the offer.</p>
<h2>Buy-writes</h2>
<p>You can add a little edge to deep-in-the-money
covered calls by entering the trade as a buy-write where
both orders, the long stock and short call, are executed
simultaneously.&nbsp; Because market makers love combinations
of stock, calls, and puts to get them into locked
positions, they will usually give you a break on the
natural quote.&nbsp; For example, notice the spread on the
$45 calls above: $10-5/8 to $11-7/8 for a $1-1/4
spread.&nbsp; It is very feasible to enter an order to buy
the stock and sell the $45 call for a net debit of, say,
$42-1/2.&nbsp; While this is only $1/2 point better than the
natural $43 debit we assumed earlier, look what it does
to the returns!&nbsp; Now you are buying stock at $42-1/2 and
potentially selling it for $45.&nbsp; That's a 5.88% simple
return (compared to 4.65% earlier) and 261% effective
annualized compounded rate (compared to 178%).&nbsp; What a
difference a half point can make.</p>
<p>You do not need to necessarily look at volatile
stocks for this strategy to work either.&nbsp; For example,
take General Electric (GE), which is considered to be
one of the bluest of blue-chips.&nbsp; The stock is trading
for $48-7/8 and the January $43-3/8 strike is trading
for $7 to $7- 1/4.&nbsp; If you sell the call for $7, that's
$1-1/2 points of time premium for 51 days to
expiration.&nbsp; Chances are you will be assigned on the
short call; if so, you effectively paid $41-7/8 (paid
$48-7/8 for stock and sold call for $7) and sold for
$43-3/8 in 51 days.&nbsp; That's a simple return of 3.58% or
effective annualized compounded rate of 28.2%.&nbsp; Granted,
not as impressive as the returns we saw earlier but not
as risky either.&nbsp; Your break-even point would be $41-7/8
for a 14% downside hedge.</p>
<h2>Two warnings</h2>
<p>If you trade in small lots (say 100 to 300 shares),
make sure the commissions do not eat away your profits
before entering the buy-write.&nbsp; To check, calculate the
total net debit including commission to enter the
position and the total credit to sell it (called <i>
unwinding</i> the position).&nbsp; If you are trading in
small lots (or being charged very high commissions), it
will not be uncommon to see the difference between your
net credit from the sale and net debit from the purchase
be close to the same.&nbsp; If that's the case, it's
definitely not worth doing.&nbsp; Make sure there are
significant dollars left over and that you feel that
amount is worth the risk.</p>
<p>The second warning is to make sure you are not being
compensated at only the risk-free rate.&nbsp; The time
premium on an option will approach the risk-free rate as
you look deeper-in-the-money.&nbsp; For example, in the GE
example above, we assumed the trader buys stock at
$41-7/8.&nbsp; So the trader is missing out on interest on
$41-7/8 by entering the covered call.&nbsp; If we assume a
risk-free rate of roughly 6%, the cost of carry for this
position is $41-7/8 * 6% * 51/360 = 0.355 or about 36
cents.&nbsp; Because the time premium of $1-1/2 is higher
than 36 cents, this strategy will make financial sense
as long as the commissions do not eat away the profits.&nbsp;
If enough strikes were available, you could keep looking
further in-the-money and eventually find one that is
trading for exactly the cost of carry (if you are
familiar with delta, it will be where delta equals
one).&nbsp; This will be true for all strikes below this
strike too.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To enter a deep-in-the-money covered call with
options that exactly pay the risk-free rate of interest
is to pay two commissions to enter the position yet earn
the exact amount had you just left the money in the
risk-free money market.&nbsp; Why will the markets only
reward you the risk-free rate if you look deep enough
into the calls?&nbsp; Because the deeper in-the-money you go,
the less risky the strategy becomes.&nbsp; At a certain
strike and below, the markets will view the
deep-in-the-money covered position as nearly risk-free,
and will only reward you the risk-free rate.</p>
<p>As a reminder, covered calls should really be
attempted with stocks you would own regardless.&nbsp;
Remember, the downside risk is that the stock falls.</p>
<p>Covered calls can be a very rewarding strategy,
especially when you get the risk-reward ratios in
proportion to your taste.&nbsp; If you feel the
out-of-the-money covered positions you've tried did not
feel quite right, try deep-in-the-money calls for a
revitalizing change.</p>
