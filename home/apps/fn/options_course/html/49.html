<h1>Synthetic Short</h1>

<p>If you read the section on synthetics, you should
have a handle on how they work.&nbsp; Now we'll show you how
powerful they can be.</p>
<h2>Shorting stock</h2>
<p>Before we talk about synthetic short stock, let's go
through the basic short sale.</p>
<p>A popular strategy among bearish investors is
shorting stock.&nbsp; When you short stock, you are selling
it first and then buying it back later at hopefully a
lower price.&nbsp; Short sellers are attempting to sell high
and buy low -- just in the reverse order of bullish
investors.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In order to sell stock you don't own, you must borrow
it from another investor.&nbsp; While this may sound
complicated, it is a seamless transaction and usually
takes a matter of seconds to execute.</p>
<p>Notice how the short stock position is exactly
opposite the long position:</p>

<p>This means the investor who is short stock has
unlimited upside liability.&nbsp; As the stock moves higher,
the short position increases its losses.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Uptick</h2>
<p>There is one catch with selling stock short; the sale
must be done on an <i>uptick </i>or a <i>zero-plus tick</i>.&nbsp;
What is an uptick?&nbsp; Say a stock is quoted bid $25 and
offered at $25-1/2 with the last trade at $25.&nbsp; If the
next trade is higher than the last trade of $25, that
new trade is an uptick.&nbsp; If the trade is lower, it is a
downtick.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you look at the last trade of a stock, you will
usually see a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; sign to the side (or on some
systems, an up or down arrow).&nbsp; The &quot;+&quot; indicates and
uptick and the &quot;-&quot; a downtick.&nbsp; Using the above example,
if the next trade is $25-1/4, you will see the last
trade reported as +$25-1/4.&nbsp; If the following trade is
back to $25, you will see -$25.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the next trade is $25-1/4, again, you will see
+$25.&nbsp; What if the following trade is also $25- 1/4?&nbsp;
That is called a <i>zero-plus</i> tick indicating that
the last <i>change</i> was an uptick but the recent
prices are unchanged.</p>
<p>The uptick rule was created to prevent investors from
selling into a sharp downtrend, thereby nearly
guaranteeing a profit.&nbsp; The rule is of little
significance to the investor other than it must be met.&nbsp;
There is nothing the trader needs to do other than place
the order -- either it will fill or it won't.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Because of the uptick rule, it is possible for a
short sale to not execute even if it is a <i>market
order</i>!</b></p>
<p>We've seen there are two main obstacles to overcome
when shorting stock: shares must be located to be
borrowed <i>and</i> the sale must occur on an uptick.</p>
<h2>Locating shares</h2>
<p>Although it is fairly uncommon, it is possible for
shares to not be available for shorting.&nbsp; Around April
of 1999, there was a four-month period where Amazon.com
(AMZN) was starting to fall after being on a record
climb to the upside (shown in red circle below).&nbsp; Prior
to that, investors saw it fall from nearly $100 to just
above $40 (blue circle).&nbsp; So once it started falling
again in late April, investors were eager to sell it
short hoping it would fall back to $40.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/095.gif'>

<p>But many investors were unable to capitalize on the
situation, as there was a two-week period or so where <u>
no</u> shares were available to short!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most investors would let the situation pass as an
unfortunate market technicality, and miss out on a
potentially terrific trading opportunity.</p>
<p>But if these same investors understood synthetic
options, they would have participated fully on the short
side.&nbsp; Better yet, they would avoid the uptick rule.</p>
<h2>Synthetic short stock</h2>
<p>If you read our section on synthetics, you will
recall the equation for synthetic options is Stock + Put
- Call = ?&nbsp; Because we want to find out the synthetic
equivalent of short stock, we need to get short stock
(minus stock) by itself in the equation.&nbsp; If we subtract
stock from both sides, we get Put - Call = - Stock and
there's the answer: Long put + short call = short stock.</p>
<p>Basically what investors are doing with synthetic
short sales is buying puts, and that gives them the
right to sell the stock so, will appreciate as the stock
falls -- just like a short stock position.&nbsp; However,
puts can be very expensive especially under the
conditions in the chart above.&nbsp; So in order to pay for
the puts, investors will sell calls and use the proceeds
to buy the puts.&nbsp; If the stock is trading for $100, the
trader should theoretically receive a credit from the
trade.&nbsp; But due to bid-ask spread and commissions, the
synthetic short sale will usually result in a slight
debit.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint, the synthetic
short position looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/096.gif'>

<p>We can see that is looks exactly like our short stock
position shown earlier; at expiration, the investor
gains point-for-point if the stock falls, and loses
point-for-point if it rises.&nbsp; The synthetic position, at
expiration, is behaving exactly like short stock.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that options do not
behave like stock until expiration unless they are very
deep-in-the-money.&nbsp; So if a trader executes a synthetic
short at a strike of $100, the profit and loss diagram
will not have the above shape until expiration.&nbsp; If a
trader wishes to have the options behave more like
stock, he should consider buying an in-the-money put and
selling and in-the-money call.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What's great about the synthetic short is that it <u>
does not need an uptick</u> to execute.&nbsp; You simply
place your order to buy the put and sell the call.&nbsp; Of
course, it is usually suggested these two trades be
placed simultaneously to prevent <i>execution</i> or
risk -- the risk of an unfavorable market move while you
are executing two separate orders.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the short call position is naked.&nbsp;
This means you will generally need level-3 option
approval and, in addition, will have an option
requirement in order to hold the naked call position.&nbsp;
Be sure to check with your broker if you are unsure as
to how that works.&nbsp; The requirement is not a huge offset
for the synthetic position compared to short stock; the
short stock position will be charged with a 50% Reg T
requirement, which is not applicable to the synthetic.</p>
<h2>Bullet strategy</h2>
<p>There is an interesting strategy known as a &quot;bullet&quot;
where investors can actually intensify the fall of a
stock and increase the odds that they will make money.&nbsp;
Here's how it works,&nbsp; Say a stock is in a rapid
decline.&nbsp; You'd like to short it, but you're concerned
there may not be an uptick.&nbsp; However, if you buy a put,
the market maker will be forced to short the stock and
buy a call to create the long put position for you.&nbsp;
Market makers are not subject to the uptick rule; they
can just hit the bid and execute a short sale.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One strategy is to buy <i>deep-in-the-money puts</i>,
which force market makers to hedge nearly
dollar-for-dollar and short an equal number of shares.&nbsp;
For example, say a stock is trading for $100 and falling
sharply.&nbsp; If you buy a deep-in-the-money put such as a
$130 (or wherever delta is near 1), the market maker
will sell nearly 100 shares for each put, thereby
putting more downward pressure on the underlying.&nbsp;
Because you hold a deep-in-the-money put, it will
appreciate nearly dollar-for-dollar with each point fall
in the underlying.</p>
<p>To exacerbate the fall further, you can enter the
deep-in-the-money synthetic short position by selling
the calls, too.&nbsp; Now the market maker will be forced to
short the stock again nearly point-for-point.&nbsp; So if you
buy 10 puts and sell 10 calls (both deep-in-the-money),
the market maker will be forced to short nearly 2,000
shares without an uptick.</p>
<h2>Semifutures</h2>
<p>There is a related strategy that has a little less
risk called a <i>semifuture</i>.&nbsp; The strategy can be
used as a long or short position.&nbsp; If you want a
synthetic short position with a little less risk, you
can split the strike prices, such as buy the $50 put and
sell the $55 call.&nbsp; The more distance you put between
the strikes the less upside risk there is.&nbsp; From a
profit and loss standpoint, the short semifuture
position looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/097.gif'>

<p>You can see that the flat area between $50 and $55
creates less risk to the upside.&nbsp; In other words, with
synthetic stock at $50, the trader is exposed to losses
for any stock price above $50.&nbsp; With the semifuture, the
trader is not exposed to losses until the stock is above
$55.</p>
<p>The semifuture strategy can be split further.&nbsp; For
example, the trader may buy the $45 put and sell the $55
call.&nbsp; Now there will be less risk to the upside, but
also less profit to the downside as shown in the
following chart:&nbsp; </p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/098.gif'>

<p>Market downturns can be fast and furious, which is
what attracts speculators to short sales.&nbsp; Many
investors recognize potential situations, but are unable
to capitalize on them due to market restrictions.&nbsp; If
you understand synthetics, you can overcome many
restrictions and profit from your outlook on the market.</p>
