<h1>Covered Calls</h1>

<p>For many investors, the covered call is their first
encounter with options.&nbsp; It is a popular strategy
because it generates cash into the account and is
relatively simple to understand.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there
are a lot of misconceptions about this strategy and some
can lead to devastating losses.&nbsp; This may be the
single-most important piece of information you will read
on options, as there are many professionals and academic
journals that fall prey to one of the most critical
mistakes with covered calls.&nbsp; I will point out the
mistake later.</p>
<h2>What is a covered call?</h2>
<p>A covered call (also called a covered write) is a
strategy where the investor buys stock and then sells a
call against it.&nbsp;By selling the call, you are giving
somebody else the right to buy your stock at a fixed
price.</p>
<p>The reason this strategy is called &quot;covered&quot; is
because you are not at risk if the stock moves higher.&nbsp;
This is different from the trader who sells calls
&quot;uncovered&quot; or &quot;naked,&quot; as that position will
continually lose money -- theoretically an unlimited
amount -- as the stock moves higher.&nbsp; Because of this
risk, naked call writing is among the most dangerous of
all option strategies.&nbsp; But, with covered writing, this
upside risk is removed; you will always be able to
deliver the shares no matter how high the stock is
trading.&nbsp; The short call is &quot;covered&quot; by the long stock.
</p>
<p>For example, you may buy 1,000 shares of JDSU at $102
and sell a one-month $115 strike call currently trading
for $4-1/2.&nbsp; Now, for the next month, you <u>may</u>
have to sell your shares at a price of $115.&nbsp; This is
regardless of where the stock is trading.&nbsp; If the stock
is trading at $200 at option expiration, you will most
likely be forced to sell your shares for $115.&nbsp; Of
course, for this right, the person buying the call paid
you $4,500.&nbsp; So on the surface, it doesn't seem to be a
bad deal.&nbsp; It's like getting paid to place a sell limit
order at $115.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, there is significant risk to the downside.&nbsp;
With our JDSU trade above, we paid $102 for the stock
and received $4-1/2 for the option.&nbsp; The stock could
fall $4-1/2 points to $97- 1/2, and we'd still be okay
-- that's our break-even point.&nbsp; That's another small
benefit of covered-calls; they provide a little downside
hedge.&nbsp; In other words, they reduce the cost basis of
our long stock position.&nbsp; But if the stock continues
downward from there, we get more and more into a losing
situation.&nbsp; In fact, the maximum we could lose,
theoretically, is the $102 we paid for the stock, less
the $4-1/2 we got for the option -- a total of $97-1/2
points.&nbsp; In other words, we are at risk for everything
below the break-even point.</p>
<p>Many professionals and even academic journals will
tell you that the risk of a covered-call position is
that you may lose the stock!&nbsp; Nothing could be further
from the truth.&nbsp; Risk, for most people, is not defined
as missing out on some reward.&nbsp; It is defined as loss of
principle.&nbsp; So if you get nothing else from this page,
please understand that the risk of a covered call is
that the <u>stock goes down</u>, not up.&nbsp; This is the
mistake referred to at the beginning.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If a professional tells you the <i>risk</i> of a
covered call is losing the stock through assignment of
the short call, ask him why it's called a <i>covered</i>
position?&nbsp; He will likely tell you, &quot;That's because
you're not at risk if the stock moves higher -- you will
always be able to deliver the shares.&quot;&nbsp; Think about
it...on one hand the broker tells you the risk is that
the stock moves higher and on the other they tell you
you're not at risk if it moves higher.&nbsp; Which is
correct?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are you still not convinced that's the risk?&nbsp; Well,
think about this.&nbsp; Say you were thinking of buying a
stock trading at $100 and asked your broker what the
risk of the investment is.&nbsp; He claims, &quot;Well, the risk
is that you buy it for $100 and then sell it later at
$120, only to watch it trade higher at a later date.&quot;&nbsp;
If that were really the &quot;risk,&quot; the optimal strategy
would be to bet the farm and buy all the stock you can.&nbsp;
Buying at $100 and selling at $120 certainly doesn't
sound like a lot of risk, does it?&nbsp; The same holds for
the covered call -- <u>you</u> are the one holding the
stock.&nbsp; The risk is that the stock goes down.</p>
<h2>Two types of covered call writers</h2>
<p>This brings us to another critical point of covered
call writing.&nbsp; There are two basic categories of call
writers; those who use it as an income producing
strategy against stock they like, and those called
&quot;premium seekers.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you write calls against stock you like, then the
covered call strategy can be argued to be one of the
most powerful strategies for most investors.&nbsp; After all,
you are getting a little downside hedge and getting paid
to sell the stock at a price you see as favorable.&nbsp; If
it is a stock you like, then you obviously are willing
to assume all of the downside risk.&nbsp; You would hold the
stock whether options were available or not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, there are those who do not understand the
downside risk side of covered calls.&nbsp; These are
sometimes called the &quot;premium seekers.&quot;&nbsp; These people
look through the option quotes, find one that pays a
high premium relative to the stock price, and then enter
into a covered call.&nbsp; Usually they follow up this trade
with a comment like, &quot;By the way, what exactly does this
company do?&quot;</p>
<p>If you trade covered calls this way, stop!&nbsp; I have
seen million-dollar accounts fall below $10,000 doing
nothing but covered-calls using this method.&nbsp; </p>

Trading Example:&nbsp; I remember one investor
who bought 7,000 shares of a stock trading
at $55 (to make matters worse, it was on
margin or borrowed funds).&nbsp; He thought he
was laughing all the way to the bank when he
discovered that a three-week option was
bidding $8 for a $55 stock.&nbsp; &quot;Wow, that's
over 15-fold on your money,&quot; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&quot;At that rate, it would take less than two
and a half years to turn $1,000 into
$1,000,000.&quot;&nbsp;
<p>The trader bought the shares and wrote
the calls waiting patiently for his windfall
to arrive.&nbsp; At option expiration, the stock
was trading at $4.&nbsp; Yes, he did get to keep
the entire $8 premium for the calls.&nbsp; I'll
let you decide if it was worth it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There was a reason the markets were
bidding up the options so high.&nbsp; They wanted
someone else to hold the risky stock.&nbsp; The
risk is that the stock falls.</div>

<h2>A word of caution</h2>
<p>Many times you will hear people say that the risk of
the stock going down in a covered call position should
not be of great concern.&nbsp; They reason that you can
always write another call after the first call expires
and eventually &quot;write your way out of the stock.&quot;&nbsp; There
is a big danger in believing this.&nbsp; Covered calls
realistically only give you <u>one</u> chance over the
short term to write the calls.&nbsp; This is not to say that
you will never be able to write a second call against
your stock.&nbsp; It's just that you may have to wait a long
time to do it.</p>
<p>For example, say a stock is trading at $100 and you
write a $105 call for $5.&nbsp; At expiration, the stock is
now $75.&nbsp; At this point, you decide to write another
call.&nbsp; You'll be lucky if the $105 call is trading for
$1/16 which, after commissions, will net you zero.&nbsp; How
about the $80 call?&nbsp; Yes, you will definitely get some
money here and let's assume another $5.&nbsp; If you write
this call and the stock goes up to $80 or higher at
expiration, you just locked yourself into a loss!&nbsp; How?&nbsp;
Your cost basis is $90 ($100 originally paid for the
stock less two calls written for $5 each) and you just
gave someone the right to buy your stock for $80, which
locks in a $10 loss.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will hear people tell you to &quot;roll
down&quot; or &quot;roll up&quot; if the stock is moving
significantly.&nbsp; However, there are drawbacks with those
strategies as well, so let's take a look at each.&nbsp;
Please just understand that covered calls do have a
sizeable amount of risk and that you may not be able to
realistically keep writing calls month after month.</p>
<h2>Rolldown</h2>
<p>We just saw a situation where an investor bought
stock for $100 and wrote the $105 call for $5, but got
locked into a loss because they wrote the $80 call at
expiration.&nbsp; Many investors incorrectly think you can
beat the market to the punch by rolling down your strike
as the stock falls.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A rolldown, for covered calls, is simply a strategy
where the investor buys the short call to close and
simultaneously sells a <u>lower</u> strike call to
open.&nbsp; The new position is a covered call but at a lower
strike; the investor has thus &quot;rolled down&quot; their strike
price.</p>
<p>For example, say the stock is now trading at $100.&nbsp;
The above investor could buy the $105 call to close and
simultaneously sell the $100 call to open.&nbsp; However,
they will receive a credit less than the difference in
strikes (you'll find out why during week 5 when we talk
about basic option pricing).&nbsp; So the investor has given
someone the right to purchase their stock for $5 less
than originally anticipated, yet received <u>less</u>
than $5 to do so -- a net loss.</p>
<p>Let's say they roll down for a net credit of $3 and
see what happens.&nbsp; Remember, the original trade was
buying stock at $100 and selling the $105 call for $3,
which gives a cost basis of $97.&nbsp; Once the rolldown is
executed, we're assuming the investor receives an
additional $3, which gives a new cost basis of $94 for a
$6 gain if the stock is called at $100.&nbsp; Keep in mind
the original trade had a profit of $8 if called at
$105.&nbsp; The reason the investor has reduced their profit
margin by $2 is because that's the net loss on the
rolldown.&nbsp; Credits can be deceiving with options.&nbsp; A net
loss develops because the investor gave somebody the
right to purchase his or her stock for $5 <u>less</u>,
yet only received $3 for it.</p>
<p>If you roll down long enough, you will eventually
lock in a loss.&nbsp; Be very careful when rolling down and
keep track of your effective cost basis.</p>
<h2>Rollup</h2>
<p>The opposite of the rolldown is the rollup.&nbsp; To enter
a rollup with covered calls, you buy the call to close
and simultaneously sell a <u>higher</u> strike call to
open.</p>
<p>Let's assume our investor is, instead, faced with the
stock trading up to $110 now.&nbsp; If they rollup, they may,
for example, buy the $105 call to close and
simultaneously sell the $110 call to open.&nbsp; Again, we'll
assume they pay less than the difference in strikes,
which will always be true prior to expiration.&nbsp; If the
investor rolls up to the $110 strike for a net debit of
$3, they have paid $3 to gain $5.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the surface, this doesn't appear to be a bad
deal.&nbsp; However, keep in mind that with the original
position, the investor is more likely to receive $105
from the exercise of the $105 call.&nbsp; Now they are short
the $110 call, which is the same price of the stock,
which means there is inherently more risk with the
rollup.&nbsp; This does not mean that investors should never
rollup a covered call, but rather use it sparingly in
situations where you are very confident that the stocks
price won't fall too dramatically.</p>
<p>Another way to view the additional risk is that, with
each rollup, you are raising the cost basis of your long
stock position.&nbsp; If you chase a fast rising stock with
rollups long enough, you will eventually end up holding
a long stock position with a relatively high cost basis
on a stock that may come crashing down.</p>
<p>Most people try to roll up to get themselves out of a
&quot;losing&quot; situation.&nbsp; For example, the above investor
wrote the $105 call.&nbsp; If the stock is suddenly trading
for $120, most investors try to undo the &quot;damage&quot; by
rolling up.&nbsp; However, you should always remember your
reason for writing the call.&nbsp; If you purchase the stock
for $100 and are willing to sell it at $105 for a $5 fee
(the option premium), you should probably let the stock
go.&nbsp; If you never intended to sell your stock, then you
must question why you wrote the original call in the
first place.&nbsp; Remember, a short call is an agreement to
give someone else the right to purchase your stock.&nbsp; If
that's not what you wanted to do, then writing calls is
the wrong strategy.</p>
<h2>Getting out of a covered call</h2>
<p>Many times investors write calls and regret it later
when they see the stock trading for a much higher
price.&nbsp; If you have a renewed confidence in the stock,
you may want to consider closing out the short call.</p>
<p>Many investors, however, have trouble with this as
they feel they are taking a huge loss.&nbsp; This is
absolutely false.&nbsp; Let's take a look at an example and
see why.&nbsp; Say an investor has $40,000 cash in the
account with no other positions.&nbsp; If he buys 100 shares
of stock for $100, he now has $10,000 worth of stock and
$30,000 cash.&nbsp; Now assume he writes a $100 call for $3,
which gives him $30,300 in cash for a <u>total account
value of $40,300</u>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now assume the stock is $130 at expiration, which
makes the $100 call worth $30.&nbsp; If the investor buys the
call to close in order to not lose the stock, they must
pay $30.&nbsp; Because they received $3 initially, they feel
they have incurred a loss of $27.&nbsp;<i> But they often
fail to realize that the stock position is now worth
more, too.&nbsp; </i>If they buy the call to close, they will
pay $3,000 <i>but now their stock is worth $13,000!&nbsp; </i>
That's because they are no longer obligated to sell the
stock for $100 once they buy the $100 call to close.&nbsp;
The stock is worth $13,000 and the cash is reduced to
$27,300 for a <u>total account value of $40,300</u> --
exactly the same as before the closing of the call.</p>
<p>If you exit a covered call position by buying the
call to close, you're really <u>swapping cash for an
unrealized capital gain in the stock</u>.&nbsp; In the above
example, the investor lost $3,000 for sure in cash, in
exchange for an unrealized gain of $3,000 in the stock.</p>
<p>So if you have new information on the stock and
decide you want to keep it, buying the call to close is
not the worst thing to happen.&nbsp; You really don't lose
anything at the moment you buy back the call -- but you
may if the stock falls afterward.&nbsp; Buying covered calls
to close doesn't really destroy account value; it just
changes the values of the assets in the account.</p>
<p>If you decide to get out of a covered call position
by buying back the call, be sure you are comfortable
holding the stock at the current valuations.</p>
<h2>Profit and loss diagram</h2>
<p>In the profit and loss diagram, we are assuming an
investor buys stock at $50 and writes a $60 call for
$5.&nbsp; You can see the break-even point has been reduced
to $45 because they paid $50 for the stock but received
$5 for the call, giving them an effective cost basis of
$45.&nbsp; Also, we see that for any stock price above $60 --
the strike -- the profit is capped at $15, which is the
maximum.&nbsp; Again, you must wonder why many professionals
tell you this is the risk zone.&nbsp; It should be evident
from the chart that the downside risk is that the stock
falls.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Covered calls are a very useful strategy if used
properly.&nbsp; If you use this strategy, make sure you are
writing calls against stock you would hold regardless.&nbsp;
Otherwise, treat the position as highly speculative and
invest accordingly.</p>
