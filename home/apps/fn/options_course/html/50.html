<h1>Systematic Writing</h1>

<p>The strategy called &quot;systematic put writing&quot; or
sometimes just &quot;systematic writing&quot; is a hedged
variation of naked, or uncovered, put writing.&nbsp; This
strategy will be appealing to investors ranging from
conservative to speculative.&nbsp; If you like writing naked
puts, this strategy will be of great interest to you.&nbsp;
If you think you would never attempt it, you may change
your mind!</p>
<p>Before we start, we should clarify some
misconceptions about naked put writing.&nbsp; When you sell a
put, you are effectively acting as an insurance company
by entering into an agreement to potentially buy stock
at a fixed price over a given amount of time.&nbsp; For this
protection, the buyer will pay you a premium.&nbsp; It's a
mutually beneficial relationship; you are willing to
insure their stock and they are willing to pay for the
peace of mind.</p>
<p>Many investors shy away from naked puts because of
the large downside risk, to a stock price of zero, if
the stock should fall.&nbsp; But these same investors are
usually willing to buy stock and hold it.&nbsp; Let's see
what the real risk is.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Say we have two investors, A and B.&nbsp; A only buys
stock and B only sells naked puts.&nbsp; In the eyes of many
investors, A is conservative, and B is a loose cannon
that speculates with options.</p>
<p>A and B each have $50,000 in their accounts.</p>
<p>XYZ stock is selling for $50 per share.&nbsp; A buys 1,000
shares but B sells 10 $50 puts, with 3 months of time,
for $8.&nbsp; Investor A now has $50,000 worth of stock and
no cash while B has $58,000 cash ($50,000 cash + $8,000
from sale of put) and no stock.&nbsp; What happens at
expiration?</p>
<p>If the stock is down, say $30, A's account will be
worth $30,000 but B's will be worth $38,000.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because B started with $58,000 but is forced to buy
stock <u>3 months later</u> for $50,000 due to the
option assignment.&nbsp; He will pay $50,000 but receive
stock worth $30,000.&nbsp; His transactions are:</p>
<p>Portfolio value at start:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$58,000<br>
Pays for option assignment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$50,000<br>
Receives stock:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$30,000</u><br>
Net account value:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$38,000</p>
<p>In fact, B's total account value will always dominate
A's for all stock prices at $58 ($50 strike price plus
$8 premium for the put) or below.&nbsp; Any stock price above
$58 at expiration, B's account will be worth $58,000 and
no more.&nbsp; From a profit and loss standpoint, the two
accounts look like this at expiration:</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p>Investor B's account dominates A's for all prices
below $58.&nbsp; His tradeoff for this privilege is that he
does not participate in any upside potential of the
stock if it moves above $50.&nbsp; Investor B is giving up
upside potential in exchange for a downside hedge.&nbsp; In
addition, B has <u>deferred</u> his payment for buying
the stock by three months in exchange for the premium.&nbsp;
So, B actually appears conservative compared to A, the
long stock position!&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you read our sections on &quot;Profit and Loss
Diagrams&quot; and &quot;Synthetic Options,&quot; you will understand
that a naked put is really nothing more than a covered
call in disguise.&nbsp; They are synthetic equivalents.</p>
<p>So, the point of all this is to understand that naked
put writing really isn't as speculative or dangerous as
some would think.&nbsp; <b>This is assuming you are writing
puts on stock you would buy regardless, not because the
premiums are high!</b></p>
<p>Hopefully you are now not as reluctant to write naked
puts.&nbsp; If so, continue reading about how systematic
writing may benefit you.</p>
<h2>The systematic writing strategy</h2>
<p>This strategy is appealing in a number of ways.&nbsp; It
allows investors to sell naked puts but adds a couple of
new dimensions.&nbsp; First, it allows the investor to dollar
cost average into the stock.&nbsp; Second, it allows for the
sale of a covered straddle thereby giving the investor
one more additional option premium to further reduce the
downside risk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The systematic writing recipe:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b>Start by writing puts on <u>half</u>
the amount of shares in which you are willing to buy
(for example, if you are willing to buy 1,000 shares,
write 5 puts).</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Repeat step 1 <u>until you are assigned</u>.&nbsp;
Again, it is very important to use this strategy only
for stocks you would be willing to buy at the strike
price regardless.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b>Once you are assigned in step 1, write
covered straddles (sell a call and sell a put).&nbsp; In this
example, the investor will write 5 calls and 5 puts.&nbsp;
The position is considered covered, because the investor
can always deliver the shares if assigned on the short
calls.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b>If the investor gets assigned from the
calls in step 2, start with step 1 again.&nbsp; If assigned
on the puts again, write covered calls against the
entire position.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Let's use our two investors above, A and B, and see
how they would fare using naked puts versus systematic
writing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Investor A is now convinced that naked put writing
may not be so bad.&nbsp; He likes the stock and would be
willing to buy 1,000 shares so he sells 10 $50 puts for
$8.&nbsp; The time to expiration is a matter of preference,
but all else equal, investors are usually better selling
shorter-term options.</p>
<h2>Step 1 for systematic writing</h2>
<p>Investor B uses the systematic strategy.&nbsp; He will
write puts on <u>one-half</u> of the position, to
represent the 500 shares he's willing to purchase.&nbsp; So
he writes only 5 of the contracts for $8.</p>
<p>At expiration, the stock is trading for $35.&nbsp; While A
is at least hedged by the amount of the original
premium, he's not willing to buy any more stock because
he is now long 1,000 shares -- his original limit --
from the assignment.&nbsp; His cost basis is $42 per share
($50 for the stock less $8 for put premium).&nbsp; He must
sit and be patient for the stock to rally.&nbsp; While it is
possible for A to write calls at this point, if the
stock is down far enough, this strategy may not be
sufficient, as there may be no premium in a $45 strike
that would be necessary to bring him to a profit if
called away.</p>
<h2>Step 2 for systematic writing&nbsp; </h2>
<p>Because B is using the systematic principle, he
bought only 500 shares from the put assignment.&nbsp; Now he
enters the second step of the strategy: writing covered
straddles.&nbsp; Investor B will now write 5 $35 puts (assume
they are $5) and 5 $35 calls (assume they are $6).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Investor B will bring in an additional $2,500 for the
puts and $3,000 for the calls.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At this point, two only two things can happen for the
stock:&nbsp; It will either be above or below $35 at
expiration.&nbsp; If the stock is above $35 (the strike
price) at expiration, B will have his shares called away
due to the short call option.&nbsp; But that's okay, as we
will see shortly that his average cost is only $33, and
he will make 2 points profit.&nbsp; But, let's assume the
stock is down again to $30.&nbsp; Investor B will buy his
second lot of 500 shares at a price of $35, the strike
of the short put.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Investor A's cost basis is $50 for the stock, less $8
for the put, for a total of $42.&nbsp; Investor B's cost
basis is effectively $42-1/2 for the purchase of stock
alone (500 shares at $50 and 500 shares at $35).&nbsp; But in
addition, B took in $4,000 for the original put sale,
and $5,500 for the covered straddle (500 * $5 for the
puts and 500 * $6 for the calls).&nbsp; The total proceeds
from the options is $9,500, for a total cost basis of
$33,000 or $33 per share for investor B.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, investor A has a cost basis of $42, and B has
one of $33 with the stock trading at $30.</p>
<p>Notice the large difference in cost basis between the
two investors.&nbsp; The majority of the difference in costs
is due to B being able to average into the stock.&nbsp; He
bought 500 shares at $50 and 500 at $35 with 3 option
premiums along the way to boot.</p>
<h2>Step 3 for systematic writing</h2>
<p>The third step for the systematic writing would
require B to write 10 calls (covered call position)
against his 1,000 shares.&nbsp; The market is at $30 and his
average cost is $33.&nbsp; Say he can sell 10 $30 calls
trading at $5 to bring his cost basis to $28 per share.&nbsp;
If he gets assigned, he will sell 1,000 shares at $30.&nbsp;
If not, he will continue to write calls against the
entire position until called out.&nbsp; At that point, he
will look to start with step 1 again in the strategy.</p>
<p>Notice too that, although a two-point profit may not
seem like such a big deal, the stock has fallen 34% from
$50 to $33.&nbsp; There is not much an investor who paid $50
for the stock can do at this point.&nbsp; But our systematic
writer is able to potentially capture a two-point profit
despite the fall.</p>
<h2>Using the strategy</h2>
<p>This is an outstanding strategy for naked put
writers; especially for stocks you expect to be
volatile.&nbsp; The average cost basis on your stock will be
greatly reduced if you are assigned on the short put
written at the time of the covered straddle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The strategy is very versatile.&nbsp; Investor B, in the
above example, could have written calls and puts with
different strike prices (called a <i>strangle</i> or <i>
combo</i>) for step 2 instead of the covered straddle.&nbsp;
Investors can select different time frames or strikes to
meet their needs.&nbsp; You can even mix and match some of
the steps.&nbsp; For example, if you are very bullish on the
stock, you may elect to enter step 2 initially.&nbsp; This
way you own half the shares you are willing to purchase
and have a short put to provide a small hedge.&nbsp; Now, if
the stock runs to the upside, at least you have some
shares to fully participate in the rally unlike the
investor who starts with step 1 and only writes puts on
half the position.</p>
<p>Again, it should be emphasized that naked put writing
can actually be viewed as a conservative strategy <i>if</i>
you are writing puts on stock you would be willing to
buy at the strike price regardless.&nbsp; If, however, you
are writing puts on stocks solely for a high premium
that is present and would rather not own the stock, be
aware that this is an extremely speculative position and
you should invest accordingly.</p>
<p>Hopefully this strategy adds some interesting
insights as to how valuable options can be for
conservative and speculative investors alike.</p>
