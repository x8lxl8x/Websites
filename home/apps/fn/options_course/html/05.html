<h1>Bid-Ask Exercise</h1>

<p>If you're still confused with bids and offers, don't
feel bad -- the concept throws many new (and even
advanced) investors. Here's a little workshop that
coaches you through getting the quotes posted that
should bring you a new level of understanding (or
confusion!) to you.</p>
<p>Let's start by assuming I am the market maker for ABC
stock. I post bids to buy the stock and offers to sell
the stock. If you wish to buy or sell, you can either
put in a &quot;market&quot; order or a &quot;limit&quot; order. If you're
not familiar with market and limit orders, don't worry.
We'll cover those in detail in the next course. All you
need to know for now is that market orders are
guaranteed to execute, which means you will likely buy
at the asking price or sell at the bid price. If you
want to try for a better price, you can enter a limit
order. With a limit order, you specify the price but
your order will not execute unless you can be filled for
that price (or a more favorable price).</p>
<h2>The Day Begins</h2>
<p>The market has just opened and I have no customer
orders on the books. Let's assume that I'm willing to
buy up to 500 shares at $30 and I'm willing to sell up
to 500 shares for $30.50. Notice how the price I'm
willing to pay is less than the price I'm trying to sell
them for. This is analogous to a car dealer who buys
used cars at wholesale and then sells them at retail,
keeping the difference as profit.</p>
<p>I therefore start the day by entering quotes into my
system, posting a bid of $30 and an asking price of
$30.50. </p>
<p>I log online and get a quote for ABC stock. My screen
looks like this:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2'><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td><b>BID $30</b></td>
<td><b>ASK $30.50</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2'><b>SIZE 500 x 500</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The &quot;size&quot; field shows the number of shares available
at the bid and ask prices respectively. This would be
read as &quot;500 by 500&quot; and means that 500 shares are on
the bid and 500 on the ask. Most quote systems give this
information but, if not, your broker will certainly have
it.</p>
<p>Now let's see what happens as orders come to me from
retail customers. We'll show how they affect my books as
well as the quotes I get online. Let's start by assuming
you have some shares you'd like to sell.</p>
<h2>Order #1</h2>
<p>You have 200 shares but you do not want to sell at my
bid price of $30. You decide to put in a sell limit
order at $30.40, which is in between the bid and ask
prices.</p>
<p>At this point, I see your order and realize that it
is more competitive than my offer (you are willing to
sell for less than $30.50). So I must do one of two
things: Either fill it at $30.40 (or higher) or display
it so that other investors may see it. </p>
<h2>Key Point</h2>
<p>Any time a limit order is placed in between the bid
and ask, that limit order is a more competitive price.
That's because, by definition, it must be a price that
is higher than the bid and lower than the ask, which are
both more favorable to the market.</p>
<p>Let's assume I decide to not fill the order. </p>
<p>The quote you're watching will change to reflect the
lower asking price. The quote you get from your broker
or online is called the &quot;inside quote&quot; and reflects the
best bid and offer. Your screen now changes to this:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2'><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td><b>BID $30</b></td>
<td><b>ASK $30.40</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2'><b>SIZE 500 x 200</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Notice how the asking price is reduced from $30.50 to
$30.40 (that's your order) as well as the size. Your
order is only good for 200 shares so the size of the
offer falls from 500 to 200.</p>
<p>Any time an order is placed &quot;in between&quot; the bid and
ask without it being filled, it will result in a
changing of the quote!</p>
<p>Because I am the market maker, I must keep track of
<u>all</u> quotes even though I only show the best bid
and offer. My computer software will show this:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table6'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='4' v><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2' v><b>BIDS</b></td>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30.50</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>$30.40</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2'>&nbsp;</td>
<td colSpan='2'><b>OFFERS</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Basically all that happens is that the bids or offers
that are &quot;away&quot; from the market get shifted. When we say
&quot;away&quot; from the market, we mean that they are not as
favorable a price. In this case, my offer of $30.50
(shown in red) is shifted higher and your order takes
its place.</p>
<p>Notice too how your quote system online only shows
the one row of my book (in blue). That is all you will
ever see even though there are many quotes above and
below that. Once again, this is because the market is
really only concerned with the highest bid and lowest
offer (the inside quote).</p>
<p>Let's run through a few more examples so we can get
some orders on the books. Then we'll look at how to fill
orders based on the book.</p>
<h2>Order #2</h2>
<p>Another investor comes along and enters an order to
buy ABC stock. They think it will fall a bit first and
place a limit order to buy 400 shares at $29.</p>
<p>Once again, I get this order and notice that it is
not as competitive as my bid of $30 so will just move
that order out in the &quot;wings&quot; to be filled at hopefully
a later time. In other words, because this new order is
not in between the bid and ask, it is therefore less
competitive and just gets pushed aside for now. My
system now looks like this:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table7'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='4' v><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2' v><b>BIDS</b></td>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30.50</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>$30.40</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>400</td>
<td>$29</td>
<td colSpan='2'><b>OFFERS</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The lower bids (worse for the market) get moved lower
and the higher offers (worse for the market) get moved
higher. Remember, the market is only concerned with the
highest bid and the lowest offer. All others get &quot;swept
aside&quot; for the meantime. This practice always keeps the
best bid and offer in the middle of my screen.</p>
<h2>Order #3</h2>
<p>A new order comes in to buy 100 shares at $28.50.
This buyer is the weakest of all bidders (the lowest),
so it gets moved to the very bottom. My system now looks
like this:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table8'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='4' v><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2' v><b>BIDS</b></td>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30.50</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>$30.40</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>400</td>
<td>$29</td>
<td colSpan='2' rowSpan='2'><b>
OFFERS</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>100</td>
<td>$28.50</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Notice how the &quot;buy&quot; orders are always placed under
the &quot;bid&quot; column and the &quot;sell&quot; orders are always under
the &quot;offers.&quot; This is in line with what we said earlier:
The bid price represents buyers and the offer price
(asking price) represents the sellers.</p>
<h2>Order #4</h2>
<p>Hopefully you're getting the idea of how this works
so let's go ahead with several orders and assume the
following orders are received:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell 300 shares at $30.75
</li>
<li>Sell 150 shares at $30.45
</li>
<li>Buy 250 shares at $29.50 </li>
</ul>
<p>The first order to sell 300 shares at $30.75 is the
highest of all current offers, so they go to the very
back of the line:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table9'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='4' v><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2' rowSpan='2'><b>BIDS
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
</b></td>
<td>300</td>
<td>$30.75</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30.50</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>$30.40</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>400</td>
<td>$29</td>
<td colSpan='2' rowSpan='2'><b>
OFFERS</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>100</td>
<td>$28.50</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The next order is to sell 150 shares at $30.45. They
are higher than the best offer of $30.40 but are not the
worst one either. They get wedged between the offers of
$30.40 and $30.50 as shown below. The same idea applies
to the last order to buy 250 at $29.50. They get wedged
between the orders to buy 400 at $29 and 500 at $30:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table10'>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='4' v><b>ABC STOCK</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td colSpan='2' rowSpan='3'><b>BIDS</b></td>
<td>300</td>
<td>$30.75</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30.50</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td><b>150</b></td>
<td><b>$30.45</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>500</td>
<td>$30</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>$30.40</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td><b>250</b></td>
<td><b>$29.50</b></td>
<td colSpan='2' rowSpan='3'><b>
OFFERS</b></td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>400</td>
<td>$29</td>
</tr>
<tr align='middle'>
<td>100</td>
<td>$28.50</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This process continues with all bids and offers are
placed in descending order. If an order comes in that is
the most competitive bid or offer, it will be placed at
the very front of the line. Otherwise, the order takes
its appropriate place in line.</p>
<p>Let's do one more like that to be sure you
understand.</p>
<h2>Order #5</h2>
<p>An order comes in to buy 100 shares at $30.20, which
is in between the current quote of $30 to $30.40.
Therefore, the order jumps to the front of the line as
shown. In other words, because it is are now the highest
bid, it moves to the front of the line. The only way to
get moved to the front of the line, whether buying or
selling, is to place a limit order in between the bid
and ask. My computer screen now looks like this:</p>

<h2>Filling Orders</h2>
<p>Now let's look at some orders that actually get
filled. The reason that none of the orders got filled in
the first examples is because none of the buyers
accepted the offer price (called &quot;taking the offer&quot; in
trader's jargon) or sold at the bid (called &quot;hitting the
bid&quot;). All orders were either &quot;in between&quot; the bid and
ask or away from the market. Now we're going to focus on
what happens when orders actually get filled.</p>
<h2>Order #1</h2>
<p>An order comes in to buy 200 shares &quot;at market.&quot; </p>
<p>Because those investors listed in the &quot;offers&quot; column
are sellers, I know I can match this buy order with the
person there and fill the order. The trade &quot;200 at
$30.40&quot; is removed from my books and all the offers are
now shifted down. The best offer is now $30.45:</p>

well. You will now see:</p>

<p>The buyer receives a confirmation from his broker
that he bought 200 shares at $30.40, and the seller
receives a confirmation of the sale under the same
terms.</p>
<h2>Order #2</h2>
<p>An order comes in to buy 350 shares at market. Market
orders must be filled, so I look at my books and will
have to split some orders. I will give the person 150
shares at $30.45 and 200 shares from the order above it
at $30.50 as shown by the arrows: </p>

<p>The person who had the order to sell 500 shares at
$30.50 will receive a confirmation from his broker that
200 shares were sold at $30.50, and he will still have
an open order to sell the remaining 300 at $30.50.</p>
<p>The investor who placed the order to buy 350 shares
at market will also receive partial fills. Their broker
will inform them that they bought 150 shares at $30.45
and 200 shares at $30.50. This explains why it is not
uncommon to see &quot;partial fills&quot; on your account!</p>

<p>The market order must be filled so we find some
buyers (bidders) to match up to this seller.
Specifically, we need 700 shares. We look in the bid
column and will fill:</p>
<ul type='disc'>
<li>100 shares at $30.20
</li>
<li>500 shares at $30
</li>
<li>100 shares at $29.50 </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in reality, the market maker will usually step
in and provide some liquidity. For instance, I could
decide to fill 100 shares at $30.20 and 600 shares at
$30, thus giving up 100 shares from my own account. It
is not required, but is usually done to provide more
liquid markets. For now, let's assume that the order is
filled as we originally stated in the bullet points
above. My books now look like this:</p>
<p>And your quotes will now show:</p>

<p>Notice how the spread -- the difference between the
bid and ask -- has widened to $1. At the very beginning
of this exercise, the quote was $30 to $30.50, which is
only a half-point spread. The spreads will generally
widen if the market maker only fills orders based on the
book like we've been doing in these examples. This is
why market makers usually step in and provide some
liquidity to keep an orderly market. If they didn't, the
spreads would just keep getting wider and wider as
orders are filled.</p>
<p>Hopefully this exercise sheds some light on what
happens with the bids and offers and how the orders are
handled. More importantly, you just need to be aware
that when your broker quotes you a bid price, that is
the price of the highest buyer and, consequently, the
price where you can currently sell. Likewise, if you get
a quote on the ask, that is the price of the lowest
selling price and, consequently, the price where you can
currently buy.</p>
