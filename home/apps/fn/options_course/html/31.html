<h1>Straddles & Strangles</h1>

<p>A long straddle is a strategy where the investor buys
a call and buys a put with the same strike and time to
expiration.</p>
<p>The most common use of the strategy is when the
trader expects a large move but is unsure about which
direction.&nbsp; This strategy is often suggested, even by
professionals, to be used prior to a big announcement
such as an earnings report or FDA approval for a drug
company.&nbsp; If the report is favorable, the stock may run
wild to the upside; if not, it may come crashing down.&nbsp;
However, please bear in mind that other participants in
the market are thinking the same thing, so the put and
call will be bid up to much higher prices making it
difficult to recoup your costs!</p>
<p>Probably a better use of the straddle is to buy them
if you expect <i>increases</i> in volatility.&nbsp; Increased
volatility will increase the price of both calls and
puts.&nbsp; So, if you are faced with a big announcement or
news, you should buy the straddle only if you think the
market has underestimated the volatility.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the strategy attempts to play both sides
of the market hoping that the move in the underlying
stock, whether up or down, is sufficient to cover the
cost of the losing option.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>A trader buys a March $50 call for $5, and a March
$50 put for $3 for a total of $8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The profit and loss diagram looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/032.gif'>

<p>Because the trader buys both the call and put, the
break-even points will be raised significantly.&nbsp; In this
case, the stock must rise above $58 (the strike price
plus both premiums) or fall below $42 (the strike price
minus both premiums).&nbsp; Because only one of the options
-- either the call or put -- can expire in-the-money[1],
the downside to this strategy is that you are
effectively buying a very expensive call and a very
expensive put.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Again, only one of the options can
have value at expiration not both.&nbsp; However, both
premiums must be recovered before a profit can be made.&nbsp;
It's like buying a call for the price of a call and a
put and buying a put for the price of a call and a put.&nbsp;
If you think making money with calls or puts is tough,
the straddle will magnify this difficulty.</p>
<p>[1]&nbsp; Actually, this is true the
majority of the time; either the call or put finish with
intrinsic value.&nbsp; However, if there is a partial tender
offer for the underlying stock, both the call and put
may go in-the-money!&nbsp; This happens because the target
stock will be trading higher and so will the calls.&nbsp; But
after the purchase, the target stock will normally fall
back to the original price.&nbsp; Traders will start pricing
the puts with this intrinsic value causing both the
calls and puts to be in-the-money.</p>
<p>Be very careful if you hear of seminars or books that
profess to show you how to &quot;make money in any market&quot; as
this is the strategy they are often alluding to.&nbsp; If the
stock moves up or down, technically you are making money
on <u>one of the legs</u> -- either the call or put --
but being <u>profitable</u> is another story.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the straddle is a bad
strategy.&nbsp; Just don't get lured into thinking it's a
sure bet.&nbsp; The two premiums will almost always make the
straddle a sure loser (in trader's jargon, the high
gamma and negative theta components usually won't allow
it to be profitable).&nbsp; Use the straddle when you are, in
fact, expecting a really BIG move in one direction or
another and you feel the market has underpriced it.</p>
<h2>The short straddle</h2>
<p>If the long straddle is almost a sure loser, then the
short straddle must be the ultimate option strategy,
right?&nbsp; Not so fast.&nbsp; Yes, it's true that over time the
short straddle will win far more than it will lose;
however, when straddles go against you, they can bite
hard!&nbsp; You need to be prepared to accept a large loss
before entering into the short straddle.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/033.gif'>

<p>Here, the short trader will receive $8 in our
hypothetical example and have break-even points of $42
and $58.&nbsp; Beyond these points, large losses can quickly
develop!</p>
<h2>Alternative strategy - the covered straddle</h2>
<p>There is a nice alternative for the short straddle
called a <i>covered straddle</i>.&nbsp; Here, the investor is
long the stock and then sells the straddle.&nbsp; Assuming
the number of call options does not exceed the
equivalent number of long shares, the investor is fully
covered to the upside.&nbsp; The risk is that the stock
falls.&nbsp; But if the investor is willing to buy more
shares, this can be a powerful strategy!!</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>An investor is long 500 shares of stock purchased at
$50.&nbsp; He then sells 5 contracts of the above straddle
for $8.&nbsp; The investor will receive 500 * $8 = $4,000.&nbsp;
If the stock is above $50 at expiration, the investor
will be assigned on the short call and sell his shares
-- effectively for $58. But if the stock is below $50,
the trader will be assigned on the short puts and be
forced to buy stock at $50, which is effectively $42
when you consider the $8 premium from the straddle. You
can see the benefits of this strategy!&nbsp; If you are
willing to buy more, and are not afraid to sell your
shares, the covered straddle is a tough one to beat.&nbsp; It
is called a covered straddle because the long shares
cover the most serious risk in that the stock moves
higher.</p>
<h2>Strangles </h2>
<p>A related strategy to straddles is one called a <i>
strangle </i>and sometimes called a <i>combination[2]
</i>or &quot;combo&quot; for short.</p>
<p>[2] The term <i>combo </i>varies
between markets.&nbsp; In the equity markets, a combo is
usually long calls and long puts with different
strikes.&nbsp; In the futures markets, however, a combo is
usually a synthetic stock position -- long calls and
short puts with the same strikes.</p>
<p>The idea behind straddles and strangles is the same
in that the investor is looking for a large move in one
direction or another.&nbsp; The strangle differs in that the
strike prices are different.&nbsp; The expiration months are
the same.</p>
<p>Earlier, we assumed a trader with the stock at $50
bought the $50 call and $50 put for a total of $8.&nbsp; Now
let's say that same trader buys a strangle instead.&nbsp; He
may buy the $55 call and the $45 put for a total of only
$5.&nbsp; But the tradeoff is big; this trader's break-even
points are now $40 and $60 instead of $42 and $58 with
the straddle trader.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called a $45/$55 strangle.</p>
<p>This does not mean that strangles are a poor
strategy.&nbsp; It just means you should be careful in
choosing it.&nbsp; Use it when you really expect monstrous
moves in the underlying, and not because it's cheaper
than the straddle.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/034.gif'>

<p>It is easy to see that the stock must make a really
large move in order to be profitable!&nbsp; Also, there is no
reason the trader must limit themselves to a 5-point
difference in strikes.&nbsp; One could also enter a $40/$50
strangle or any other combination as long as they cover
the same expiration months.&nbsp; Keep in mind though, as you
make the difference in strikes wider, your break-even
points become wider as well.</p>
<h2>The short strangle</h2>
<p>The short strangle is similar to the short straddle
but, from a risk/reward standpoint, it may be a better
deal for most investors simply for the fact that the
break-even points are stretched so wide.&nbsp; </p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/035.gif'>

<h2>In-the-money and out-of-the-money strangles</h2>
<p>One small point should be clarified here.&nbsp; In the
above example, we assumed the stock was at $50 and the
trader bought a $45 put and $55 call to complete the
strangle. </p>
<p>This is specifically known as an out-of-the-money
strangle because both the call and put are out of the
money.&nbsp; There is another alternative position --
sometimes called a <i>guts </i>by floor traders where
the trader will buy, say, the $45 call and the $55 put.</p>
<p>Be careful when discussing strangles with your
broker, as this is a very common mistake!&nbsp; Say the $45
call is trading for $8, and the $55 put is trading at $6
for a total purchase price of $14.&nbsp; It is very easy to
think that the maximum loss is $14.&nbsp; However, this
position has a built-in box position because one of the
options must always be in-the-money.&nbsp; This particular
strangle must be worth $10 at expiration (of course, the
bid/ask spreads will make it worth slightly less).&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Work through some numbers and you will see that it
is impossible to have both the call and put expire
worthless.&nbsp; In the original example, the call and put
would expire worthless for any stock price between $45
and $55.</p>
<p>The maximum loss for this in-the-money-strangle is
only $4.&nbsp; In addition, you get the benefits of
in-the-money calls and puts working for you so your time
decay is diminished significantly.</p>
<p>Just be aware that there is a difference.&nbsp; An
out-of-the-money strangle has the put with the lower
strike and the call with the higher strike.&nbsp; In this
case, the maximum loss is the total cost of the two
positions.</p>
<p>The in-the-money strangle has the call with the lower
strike and the put with the higher strike -- exactly the
opposite of the out-of-the-money strangle.&nbsp; Here, the
maximum that can be lost is the premium minus the
difference in strikes.&nbsp; In our example, $14 -$10 = $4.</p>
<p>Straddles and strangles are popular strategies,
especially in a lot of beginning courses because they
are combination positions yet easy to understand.&nbsp; From
a practical trading standpoint, the long
straddle/strangle is not too practical because of the
wide break-even points.&nbsp; Typically, the stock will
bounce around between these two points and you will just
watch you position erode from the time decay (high
negative theta of the position).</p>
<p>From a traders viewpoint, the short positions are
much more desirable, but just be sure you are, in fact,
willing to assume risks if it should go against you.</p>
<p>In fact, you can even combine these strategies.&nbsp; If
you short a straddle and buy a strangle, you effectively
put protective wings on the upside and downside risks of
the short straddle.&nbsp; The combination of these two
positions -- short straddle and long strangle -- is also
called a butterfly spread! (Please see our section on
Butterfly Spreads for more information.)</p>
