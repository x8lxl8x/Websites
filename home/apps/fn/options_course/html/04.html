<h1>Show Or Fill Rule</h1>

<p>This is a great little tip for all option investors
-- especially those who trade smaller numbers of
contracts, say 1 to 5.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is known as the &quot;Limit Order Display Rule&quot; or
sometimes called the &quot;Show or Fill Rule&quot; (the official
name is &quot;Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-4).&nbsp; It is not a rule
that the market makers make very well known for obvious
reasons, as we shall soon see.&nbsp; However, knowing this
rule can make a big difference in your option profits!</p>
<p>Before we look at the rule, we need to understand
some basics to the quoting system used for stocks and
options. </p>
<p>Let's say you get a quote on an option as follows:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;$5-3/4 </p>
<p>What exactly does this mean?&nbsp; It means the market
makers are &quot;bidding&quot; $5 for the option; this is the
price they are willing to pay.&nbsp; They are &quot;asking&quot; $5
3/4; this is the price where they are willing to sell.&nbsp;
There is often a lot of confusion to these terms but
they are really quite simple if you think of the
following analogy.&nbsp; If you sell your house, you are
&quot;asking&quot; a certain price, right?&nbsp; If you are buying a
house, you put in a &quot;bid&quot; for it.&nbsp; Bid means buy, ask
(sometimes called the offer) means sell.</p>
<p>The reason for the confusion is this: Retail
investors who buy options are used to paying the
&quot;asking&quot; price so they often think the ask price
represents the buyers.&nbsp; Similarly, if they sell their
option, they are used to receiving the bid price so they
think the bid price represents the sellers.</p>
<p>But think about this. If you are buying the option,
you need a seller to take the other side of the trade.&nbsp;
The reason you can buy the option at the ask price is
because the market maker, the person on the other side
of the trade, is willing to sell for that price.&nbsp; Now
you have a buyer matched with a seller and the trade can
be executed.&nbsp; Likewise, if you sell your option, you can
be matched with the buyer at the bid.</p>
<p>When you get a quote, the bid price represents the
highest bidder and the ask price represents the lowest
offer or seller*.&nbsp; This makes sense, as we are not
concerned with the person who is willing to sell that
same option for some higher amount, say $10, or the one
who is willing to buy it for a lower amount such as $1.</p>
<h2>Trading &quot;in between&quot; the BID-ASK spread</h2>
<p>Let's go back to the original quote:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-3/4</p>
<p>Say you wanted to buy the option and did not want to
pay $5-3/4 but were willing to pay $5-1/2.&nbsp; You could
put in a <i>bid</i> (remember, you are buying the option
so you would be a bidder) simply by calling your broker
and instructing them to buy at a limit<i> </i>of
$5-1/2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Prior to the &quot;show or fill&quot; rule, the market maker
could leave the quote unchanged, letting <u>your high
bid of $5-1/2</u> not be shown as follows:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> $5-3/4</p>
<p>Say you wanted to buy the under the &quot;show or fill&quot;
rule. The market maker must do one of two things: <b>
either fill your order <u>or</u> show your order as
follows:</b></p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-1/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-3/4</p>
<p>You are now posted as the highest bidder, have
narrowed the spread, and have given someone the
incentive to sell because of the now higher bid.&nbsp; The
markets always benefit from narrow spreads.</p>
<p>Let's say another trader comes along who does not
want to sell at the $5-1/2 bid price, but is willing to
receive $5-5/8.&nbsp; This trader could put in an order to
sell their contracts at a limit of $5-5/8.&nbsp; Assuming the
market maker does not fill the trade, the quote now
looks like this:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-1/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; $5-5/8</p>
<p>Again, the spread has been narrowed further and a
stronger incentive is now given to the market to buy
since the asking price has just been reduced from $5-3/4
to $5-5/8</p>
<p><b>KEY POINT:</b>&nbsp; <b>It is an exchange policy (at
least for the major ones) to have all quotes good for <u>
at least 20</u> contracts.</b></p>
<p>Here's how you can benefit from this knowledge!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Going back to the original quote:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-3/4</p>
<p>Say you want to buy a small number of contracts such
as 3.&nbsp; Now, if you put in a bid of $5-1/2, the market
maker either needs to <u>fill you</u> or <u>show you</u>.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, the market maker does not want to
sell you the option at $5-1/2 because he's asking $5-
3/4.&nbsp; But, if he doesn't fill you, he must show your
order and change the quote to:</p>
<p><b>BID&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-1/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ASK&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>$5-3/4</p>
<p>Here's the benefit!&nbsp; The market maker is thinking:&nbsp;
&quot;If I show the order and post the bid at $5-1/2, I <i>
may </i>have to buy another 17 contracts<i> </i>since my
quotes must be good for at least 20 contracts.&nbsp; I'm
really only willing to bid $5, so let me fill this order
to get it out of the way!&quot;</p>
<p>How can you profit from this?&nbsp; Think of all the times
you bought at the ask price or sold at the bid.&nbsp; Those
1/4 and-1/2 (or much more) point spreads on both sides
really start to add up.&nbsp; Placing trades &quot;in between&quot; the
bid and ask can make all the difference on your profits,
especially for smaller numbers of contracts.</p>
<p>* Technically, the BID and ASK represent the best bid
and offer <i>at the margin</i>, the point where price is
determined.&nbsp; For example, someone could come in and bid
$6 but would be filled at $5- 3/4 because they are
outside the margin.&nbsp; The quote would not jump to $6 on
the bid even though they are, technically, the highest
bidder.&nbsp; It's a technical point, but for our purposes,
you can think of the BID as the highest bidder and the
ASK as the lowest offer.</p>
