<h1>Naked Put Alternatives</h1>

<h2>Spreads as an alternative to naked puts</h2>
<p>This section probably belongs under &quot;Basic Spreads,&quot;
but it is so powerful we feel it qualifies as its own
strategy.&nbsp; It is one that is highly overlooked, even by
the most seasoned investor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you ever use the strategy of naked puts, you will
want to reconsider once you see the difference a spread
can make!</p>
<h2>Naked put strategy</h2>
<p>As a review, recall that the strategy of selling
naked puts is actually neutral to bullish.&nbsp; If the stock
sits still or rises, the trader will profit by the
amount of the initial credit.&nbsp; However, many traders add
a twist to this strategy and use it as a way to <i>
purchase</i> stock.&nbsp; They sell puts on stocks they do
not mind owning if the put is assigned.&nbsp; Because of
this, they feel it is a win-win strategy.&nbsp; If the stock
rises, they keep the premium; if it falls, they got paid
to buy a stock they wanted to buy anyway.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is these investors we want to target in this
section. We'll show you an alternative strategy for
selling naked puts.</p>
<p>In fact, this strategy is especially useful for
investors who wish to sell naked puts (which requires
level 3 option approval) but only have approval to enter
spreads (level 2).&nbsp; This strategy allows you to
effectively sell naked puts in a level 2 account!</p>
<h2>Using far-out-of-the-money spreads</h2>
<p>Assume you are willing to buy 1,000 shares of Intel
(INTC) currently trading around $42-1/2.&nbsp; Instead, you
elect to sell a naked put, and the Jan $40 put is
trading for $3.&nbsp; If you sell 10 contracts at $3, you
bring in a credit of $3,000 and keep this amount
regardless of what happens to the stock.&nbsp; If the stock
should fall below $40, the strike, you may be required
to purchase it at $40 if the long position decides to
exercise.&nbsp; From a profit and loss standpoint your max
gains and losses are as follows:</p>
<p>Maximum gain:&nbsp; $3,000<br>
Maximum loss:&nbsp; $37,000</p>
<p>The most you can make is $3,000, but the risk is that
you may be forced to buy stock at $40, which
theoretically, could be worthless.&nbsp; You offset this $40
loss with the initial credit for a max loss of $37,000.</p>
<p>Now I know some of you are saying that Intel will
never go to zero, so the argument is invalid.&nbsp; Well,
it's probably true that it won't go to zero, at least
anytime soon, so that may not be a <i>probable</i>
risk.&nbsp; It is, nonetheless, the worst that can happen
from a naked put, and that's how we have to base our
decisions.&nbsp; Besides, there are many newer companies that
can go very close to zero even though they were
high-fliers at one time, so the risk is very real.&nbsp;
Microstrategy (MSTR) rose from $7 to over $300 within a
year -- only to return to $3 for the longest time.&nbsp;
Currently, it is trading around $16- 1/2.&nbsp; If you sold
the $300 puts, believe me, it felt like worthless stock
no matter how much you received for the put.&nbsp; Iomega
(IOM) went from $3 to over $100 in a short time and back
to $3 even quicker.&nbsp; Egghead.com (EGGS) fell from $55 to
the current price of $1-1/2.&nbsp; There are numerous
examples, so please do not discount the maximum loss
zone.</p>
<p>Back to the example.&nbsp; Let's now compare a trader who
enters a spread order.&nbsp; He will sell the $40 put for $3
but simultaneously buy a far-out-of-the-money put, say a
Jan $25, trading for $1/4.&nbsp; Because these are
simultaneous orders, it's very likely to get a better
fill between the two prices, but we will ignore that for
now.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint:</p>
<p>Maximum gain:&nbsp; $2,750<br>
Maximum loss:&nbsp; $12,250</p>
<p>This trader will take in a credit of $2,750 instead
of the $3,000 the naked put trader received.&nbsp; This is
because the spread trader will use $1/4 ($250) of his
proceeds to buy the $25 strike put.&nbsp; In doing so, he now
eliminates 25 points of risk to the downside.&nbsp; His
maximum loss is only $12,250 versus $37,000 for the
naked put.</p>
<p>The result is this: The naked put trader increased
his returns by only 1/4 point in return for accepting an
additional $24,750 potential loss ($37,000 versus
$12,250).&nbsp; That is a very expensive 1/4 point.</p>
<p>Naked puts are a great strategy, especially if you
are selling against stocks you would like to buy
regardless.&nbsp; However, when things go bad, they can
really go bad.&nbsp; This is the real risk of naked put
writing.&nbsp; Using spreads can eliminate this risk cheaply.</p>
<p>Comparing the two profit and loss diagrams:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/060.gif'>

<p>We see the two traders are virtually identical for
all stock prices down to $25.&nbsp; In fact, they are only
separated by 1/4 point, which was the difference in
initial proceeds.&nbsp; However, if things go bad and INTC
falls below $25, the spread trader will be very happy to
have the long $25 put as insurance.</p>
<p>Which profit and loss diagram looks more appealing to
you?&nbsp; Would you pay 1/4 point for it?</p>
<p>In addition, most brokerage firms will charge you the
lesser of the full spread requirement (difference in
strikes less the credit) or the naked requirement.&nbsp; So
you will never be worse off, from a margin standpoint,
with the spread order.&nbsp; Granted, it will cost you an
extra commission, but in most cases, this will be well
worth it.</p>
<p>Using far-out-of-the-money spreads as an alternative
to naked puts is a form of catastrophe insurance.&nbsp; The
trader in the above example is &quot;insured&quot; for all prices
below $25.&nbsp; Again, it is unlikely for Intel to fall
below this point, which is why the markets are pricing
the $25 put at $1/4.&nbsp; However, when using any form of
insurance, it is wise to buy insurance on high-severity
and low-probability events, and that's exactly what a
far-out-of-the-money put spread does for you; it insures
against low-probability catastrophes.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following charts to see just how
big and fast a catastrophe can happen!</p>

<p>Hopefully you will see far-out-of-the-money put
spreads as an enhanced alternative to naked put
selling.&nbsp; Many investors have gone broke selling naked
puts on &quot;good&quot; companies.&nbsp; However, good companies do
not always report good news as the above charts
demonstrate.&nbsp; It is during these times the value of the
far-out-of-the-money spread strategy will be realized.</p>
