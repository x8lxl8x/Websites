<h1>Options 101</h1>

<h2>What is an Option?</h2>
<p>While options may seem mysterious to most investors
at first, the basics are actually quite simple to
understand. </p>
<p>Options are simply legal <i>contracts</i> between
two people to buy and sell stock for a fixed price over
a given time period.</p>
<p>These contracts are standardized, meaning they
control a fixed amount of shares and expire at the same
time. Because of this standardization, they are traded
on an exchange, just like shares of stock. The contracts
are usually highly liquid, which means there are many
buyers and sellers standing by who are willing to buy or
sell. You can buy an option contract with the same speed
it takes you to call your broker and buy stock. </p>
<p>There are two types of options: <b>calls</b> and <b>
puts</b>.</p>
<h2>Long Call Options</h2>
<p>A call option gives the owner the right, but not the
obligation, to <u>buy</u> stock (&quot;call&quot; it away from the
owner) at a specified price over a given time period.
</p>
<p>In trading lingo, any asset that you buy is called a
<i>long</i>position. If you buy a call option, you are
the owner, and are long the contract. Notice that the
owner, the long position, has the right, <i>but not the
obligation</i>, to buy stock. You are allowed to
purchase the stock for a fixed price, but are not
required to do so. In other words, you have the <i>
option</i> to buy -- which is where these financial
assets get their name.</p>
<p>The price at which you can buy the stock is called
the <i>strike</i> price, which is kind of a slang term
that came into use, because that's the price where the
deal -- the contract -- was <i>struck</i>. Generally,
each contract controls 100 shares of stock, called the&nbsp;<i>underlying</i>
stock, which we will talk more about later. For now,
just understand that unless otherwise stated, each
contract controls 100 shares. </p>
<p>Each contract is good only for a certain amount of
time. Usually you can find contracts with as little as a
couple of weeks and as long as three years of time
remaining. However, these are standardized time frames,
so you don't get to pick the exact date you want it to
expire. </p>
<p>Just as stock is traded in shares, options are traded
in units called contracts<i>See</i> Trading Units <i>
contracts</i>.</p>
<p>If you buy one IBM March $100 call option (one
contract), you have the right, but not the obligation to
buy 100 shares of IBM (the underlying stock) for $100
per share (the strike price) through the expiration date
in March, which is usually the third Friday of the month.
</p>
<p>If you think about the definition of a call option,
you have probably encountered similar agreements outside
the financial markets. Your local pizza place may have a
coupon good for the next 30 days that allows you to buy
a large pizza for $10. That's similar to a <i>call</i>
option. It's like a contract locking in your purchase
price over a fixed time period. After that time period,
the option to buy at that price expires. While the pizza
shop may make an exception and allow you to use the
coupon after the expiration date, there is no such thing
with a call option. Once it's expired, it's gone. </p>
<p>Think of a call option as a coupon giving you the
right to buy stock at a fixed price through an
expiration date. The big difference between a coupon and
a call option is that you must pay for the option while
coupons are generally handed out for free.</p>
<h2>Long Put Options</h2>
<p>A put option allows the owner to <u>sell</u> their
stock (&quot;put&quot; it back to someone else) for the strike
price within a given time. As with call options, the put
buyer (long position) has the right, but not the
obligation. If you buy an IBM March $100 put, you have
the right, but not the obligation, to <i>sell</i> 100
shares of IBM for $100 per share through the third
Friday in March.</p>
<p>Buying a put option is similar to buying an auto
insurance policy. You can buy a policy for a premium and
collect the insurance value if you wreck your car. If
you don't wreck your car, you are only out the amount of
the premium. Likewise, you can buy a put option for a
premium and turn it back to the insurer (the put seller)
if your stock should crash (fall below the strike
price). If the stock stays above the strike, you would
let the &quot;insurance&quot; expire and lose only the premium you
paid.</p>
<h2>Short Calls and Puts</h2>
<p>Notice that with either calls or puts the buyers (the
&quot;long positions) have the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell. The investor on the other side (the
seller of the option, also called the &quot;short position)
has the <i>obligation</i> to fulfill the contract; he or
she has no choice. If a long call owner decides to buy
the stock, the short call trader must oblige and sell.
Likewise, if long put owners decide to sell their stock,
the short put traders must purchase the stock. <i>
Regardless of whether the short option seller is forced
to buy or sell stock, the premium</i>received from the
initial short trade is theirs to keep. That's their
compensation for accepting the risk.</p>

<h2>The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)</h2>
<p>Many new traders to options may be concerned that the
short side will not deliver. In other words, if you want
to use your option to either buy or sell shares, is
there a risk of the short seller refusing? </p>
<p>There is no need to worry about contract performance
from the short seller. In other words, if you decide you
want to purchase 100 shares of IBM at $100 with your
call option, there is no need to worry about the seller
of the call (the short call position) not delivering the
shares. This is because an intermediary called the
Options Clearing Corporation (OCC is really the buyer to
every seller and the seller to every buyer. The OCC is
well capitalized and does not run the risk of default.
Because of this, investors do not even need to know who
is on the other side of the trade, as the OCC guarantees
contract performance. Ever since the inception of the
OCC in 1973, no investor has ever lost money due to
&nbsp;default by the other party. Keep in mind this does not
mean the OCC guarantees contract <i>profitability</i>
but only that you are guaranteed to buy or sell shares
with your long option position if you decide to do so.</p>
<p>The function of the OCC is to provide investor
confidence, thereby providing better prices and
liquidity .</p>
<h3 align='center'>Exercising Options</h2>
<p>If you wish to buy stock with your call option or
sell stock with your put option, you simply call your
broker and tell them you want to exercise the option.
Three business days later, the transaction will take
place. For example, if you own a $50 call option and
decide to exercise it, your account will be debited for
$5,000 ($50 per share times 100 shares per contract)
plus commissions and credited 100 shares of stock on the
third business day. Similarly, if you own a $50 put and
exercise it, you will receive $5,000 minus commissions
and will be debited for 100 shares of stock on the third
business day. Keep in mind that you cannot exercise
portions of an option -- you either buy or sell in lots
of 100 shares. For instance, if you own one contract,
you cannot call your broker and use it to only buy 75
shares. You either buy all 100 or none at all. Of
course, if you own more than one contract, you can
certainly exercise only a portion. If you have five
contracts, you could certainly, for example, only
exercise two of them and buy 200 shares.</p>
<h3 align='center'>What If I Want Out Of My Contract?</h2>
<p>You can always get out of any contract -- long or
short -- by executing an offsetting position. For
example, if you are long a March $50 call, you can
simply sell a March $50 call (called &quot;selling to close&quot;)
and you no longer have the right to purchase the stock
for $50. If you have sold a $75 put (called &quot;selling to
open&quot;) and no longer want the obligation to buy the
stock for $75, you can simply buy a $75 put (buy to
close), which relieves you of your obligation. Bear in
mind that the price you receive or pay is determined by
the market and can be very different from where you
entered the contract.</p>
<p>For instance, if you sell a $75 put with the stock at
$80, you may receive a small amount, say $2. Later, if
the stock is trading for $70, you may wish to get out of
the contract. However, that $75 put may now be trading
for $6 meaning you sold for $2 and had to pay $6 to exit
for a loss of $4 per contract.</p>
<p>In fact, most options are closed out in the open
market this way. It's probably less than 5% of the time
that contracts are actually exercised. Just be aware
that you can always get out of a contract at any time --
it just may cost a lot to do it.</p>
<h2>How are Options Similar to Stocks?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Options are securities.
</li>
<li>Options trade on national SEC See Securities
Exchange Commission&quot; &nbsp;(Securities Exchange
Commission Securities Exchange Commission&quot;
)-regulated exchanges.
</li>
<li>Option orders are transacted through market
makers and retail participants with bids to buy and
offers to sell, and can be traded like any other
security.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do Options Differ From Stocks?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Options have an expiration date, whereas common
stocks can be held forever (unless the company goes
bankrupt). If an option is not exercised on or
before expiration, it no longer exists and expires
worthless.
</li>
<li>Options only exist as &quot;book entry, which means
they are held electronically. There are no
certificates for options like there are for stocks.
</li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of options that
can be traded on an underlying stock. Common stocks
have a fixed number of shares outstanding.
</li>
<li>Options do not confer voting rights or
dividends. They are strictly contracts to buy or
sell the underlying stock or index. If you want a
dividend or wish to vote the proxy, you need to
exercise the call option. </li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, options expire on the Saturday
following the third Friday of the expiration month.
However, this is for clearing purposes and there is
nothing the option trader can do with an option on
Saturday. The third Friday of expiration month is the
last <i>trading</i> day so, for practical purposes, it
is the day you want to consider as expiration.</p>
