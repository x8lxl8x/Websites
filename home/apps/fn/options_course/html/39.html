<h1>Option Repair</h1>

<p>If you have been buying stocks for any length of
time, you have probably been in the situation every
investor dreads -- seeing your stock down twenty or more
percent from your purchase price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some of you may be thinking that will not happen to
you because you use stop orders to prevent such losses.&nbsp;
Well, even if you use stop orders, large losses can
occur between trading days (known as gap downs).&nbsp; For
example, a stock can close at $75 one night and open the
next day at $60. &nbsp;If you have a stop order in at $75,
you will be filled at $60.&nbsp; If you have a stop limit at
$75, you will not be filled at all.&nbsp; In either case, the
stop did not work as expected and you're down!</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the use of options, we can
sometimes get out of these precarious positions with
ease.&nbsp; To do so, you need to understand the option
repair strategy.</p>
<h2>Option repair strategy</h2>
<p>This strategy is a very clever, yet simple strategy.&nbsp;
Many investors would not think to do it, which is what
makes it a powerful tool to add to your list of
strategies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The repair strategy does have a couple of
assumptions.&nbsp; First, you must be at least moderately
bullish on the stock over the short term.&nbsp; If you think
the stock is heading south, you are probably best
selling at a loss or buying protective puts as a full or
partial hedge.&nbsp; Second, you are assumed to be trying to
get out of the position by just breaking even (or close
to it).&nbsp; In other words, this strategy is not used as a
high profit one; it is designed to get you out of a bad
situation for nearly break-even.&nbsp; So if you're in a
losing stock situation and thinking, &quot;Just get me my
money back and I'll walk away,&quot; then this may be the
strategy for you.</p>
<p>With the above assumptions, we can accomplish a break
even with the repair strategy.</p>
<p>Here's how the strategy works: </p>
<p>Say you buy 1,000 shares of stock at $50 and it is
now trading for $40 -- down 20%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You think the stock will rise to $45 but not much
past that; you must be somewhat bullish in order for the
strategy to work.&nbsp; The way to design a repair strategy
under these assumptions is to look for a ratio call
spread you can write for free (if you are not familiar
with these, please see our section on &quot;Ratio Spreads&quot;).&nbsp;
How do we do that?&nbsp; In our example, we may buy 10 $40
calls for $5 and write 20 $45 calls for $2-1/2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here are the transactions:<br>
Buy 10 $40 calls for $5 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$5,000<br>
Sell 20 $45 calls for $2-1/2 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$5,000</u> <br>
Net cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p>Notice that we bought 10 and sold 20 -- a ratio call
spread.&nbsp; Normally, a ratio writer is subjected to
unlimited upside risk.&nbsp; However, because you already own
shares, you can cover 10 of the short $45 calls with
your stock and the remaining 10 contracts with the $40
call.&nbsp; Effectively you are writing 10 $45 contracts as a
covered call plus entering 10 $40/$45 bull spreads.&nbsp;
Because we can write a twice as many calls as we need to
purchase, the long $40 calls cost us nothing!</p>
<p>In most cases, you will be limited to no more than a
five-point difference in strikes.&nbsp; In other words, this
strategy will usually not work by buying the $40 and
selling the $50 calls, because that is a ten-point
difference in strikes.</p>
<p>Now, if the stock does move to $45 at expiration, the
long shares will be worth only $45 (the short $45 calls
will expire worthless).&nbsp; The $40/$45 bull spread will be
worth $5 points for a total of $50 points.</p>
<p>Here are the transactions in detail:</p>

<td v>&nbsp;</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>Long $35/$40 spread worth
$5,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>&nbsp;</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>Total account value = $50,000</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In effect, we have leveraged the account for an
upside move for no money down or additional risk.&nbsp; Our
trade-off is that we cap our upside returns.&nbsp; But if you
are not long-term bullish, then capping the upside in
exchange for break-even may make perfect sense for a
particular situation.</p>
<p>In the example above, does the stock need to close at
exactly $45 in order for the strategy to work?&nbsp; No, it
will work as long as the underlying stock rises to $45
or higher.&nbsp; Say the stock rallies all the way back to
$50 at expiration.&nbsp; Now your long stock is worth +$45
(remember, you have a $45 covered call against the
shares), and your long $40/$45 calls spread is worth +$5
for a total of $50.</p>
<p>Any stock price above $45 at expiration will result
in the total position being worth $50.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to look at the various option
strikes and months, known as option chains, to help make
your decision as to which options to buy and sell.&nbsp; You
can get these through most brokerage firms or from the
Chicago Board Options Exchange at http:/www.cboe.com.</p>
<p>The option repair strategy is yet another
demonstration as to the versatility of options.&nbsp; We have
taken these &quot;risky&quot; assets and used them in a way to
leverage our returns for no money down.&nbsp; If you take the
time to learn and understand these assets, you will
greatly improve your portfolio performance.</p>
