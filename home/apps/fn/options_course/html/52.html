<h1>Wrangles</h1>

<p>The wrangle is a complex position usually used by
market makers for reasons we will see later.&nbsp; It
consists of a long ratio spread with calls and a long
ratio spread with puts.&nbsp; Long ratio spreads are also
known as backspreads.&nbsp; A long call ratio spread is
established by selling a lower strike call and
purchasing two (or more) higher strike calls.&nbsp; Likewise,
a long put ratio spread entails selling a higher strike
put and then purchasing two (or more) lower strike puts.</p>
<p>Let's look at the individual pieces and then put them
together.&nbsp; The profit and loss diagram for a long call
ratio spread looks like this: </p>

<p>The profit and loss for the long put ratio spread
looks like this:</p>

<p>If we put these two profit and loss diagrams together
we get the wrangle:</p>

<p>If you read our section on the strategy of
&quot;strangles,&quot; you may recognize the above profit and loss
diagram as identical. However, the wrangle, unlike the
strangle, will not be exposed to the same time decay if
the stock stands still. It's my guess that the wrangle
gets its name from the fact that it is a ratioed
strangle (which sounds like wrangle). </p>
<p>It may be difficult to see why the above profit and
loss diagram results from two long ratio spreads but
let's break down the two component positions using $50
and $55 strikes and see if we can make sense of it.</p>
<p>The basic long call ratio spread is:</p>
<p><b>Sell 1 $50 call</b><br>
<b>Buy 2 $60 calls</b></p>
<p>The basic long put ratio spread is:</p>
<p><b>Sell 1 $60 put</b><br>
<b>Buy 2 $50 puts</b></p>
<p>There are many ways to dissect this position but
probably the easiest is to look at just the short
positions: sell 1 $50 call and sell 1 $60 put.&nbsp; These
two options, by themselves, are a short in-the-money
strangle also called a &quot;guts.&quot;&nbsp; The reason it is an
in-the-money strangle is because the put has a higher
strike thereby guaranteeing this position to be down <i>
at least</i> $10 (the difference in strikes) at
expiration.&nbsp; Don't let the guaranteed value bother you
because we haven't even talked about price yet; the
markets will have to pay you more than $10 for it.&nbsp; We
will use the proceeds from this short strangle to
purchase two $50 puts and two $60 calls, which is a long
out-of-the-money strangle.&nbsp; Because we are long more
contracts than short, this position must become
profitable as the market moves either up or down.&nbsp; In
other words, we are net long calls and puts so must make
money if the market explodes to either the upside or
downside.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this net long contract
position is to look at just the calls.&nbsp; If we are long
two $60 calls and short 1 $50 call, the effectively we
are net long one $60 call.&nbsp; The sale of the one $50 call
reduced our purchase price a bit and lessens the risk if
the stock should fall.&nbsp; That's why the chart goes up on
the right &quot;wing&quot; (showing profit) if the stock should
move beyond $60; we are net long 1 $60 call.</p>
<p>A similar argument can be made for the puts.</p>
<p>Is this position better than a strangle?&nbsp; It depends
on your outlook on the stock and tolerances for risk.&nbsp;
Remember, there are no superior strategies as they all
come with their own unique sets of risks and rewards
(Please see course &quot;Best Strategy&quot; under week 1).&nbsp; The
wrangle has less risk if the stock stands still but will
also take longer to become profitable if the stock does
move.&nbsp; That's because the short positions are competing
with the deltas of the long positions -- something known
as gamma risk.</p>
<p>The benefit of the short strangle is offset by its
sluggish responsiveness to moves in the underlying
stock.&nbsp; Which is better depends on you and the
circumstances at the time of the trade.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While wrangles are generally used by market makers
(after all, there are four commissions just to establish
the long position!), this doesn't mean it's not useful
for retail investors to understand.&nbsp; One scenario is
that you enter into a backspread (long ratio spread) at
one time and hedge at a later time by legging into a
wrangle.</p>
<p>But probably more important is the wrangle shows,
once again, the versatility that options provide and why
they are so necessary to understand if you want to
compete in today's markets.&nbsp; By finding different
combinations of calls and puts, you can completely
change the risk-reward characteristics to match your
needs and that is something that cannot be done with
stocks alone.</p>
