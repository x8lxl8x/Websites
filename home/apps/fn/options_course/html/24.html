<h1>Black-Scholes</h1>

<h2>The black-scholes factors</h2>
<p>According to the Black-Scholes formula for option
pricing, there are five main factors that affect an
options price.&nbsp; Technically, dividends are a sixth
factor but aren't of much concern, as they are generally
factored into the price of the option, since all market
participants know the amount of the dividend and when it
will be paid.&nbsp; However, if it is a surprise dividend or
dividend increase or cut, then it becomes a much more
relevant factor.</p>
<p>According to the Black-Scholes model, the factors
are:<br>
1) Stock price<br>
2) Exercise or strike price<br>
3) Interest rates (risk-free rate)<br>
4) Volatility of the underlying stock<br>
5) Time to expiration<br>
6) Dividends</p>
<p>We will look at each of these in turn and see exactly
the effects they have on calls and puts.&nbsp; Some will be
fairly intuitive and others not but all are important if
you really want to understand options.</p>
<h2>Stock price</h2>
<p>The stock price is probably the most obvious of all
the factors that affect an option's price.&nbsp; This is
simply due to the fact that the option's price is
derived from the underlying stock -- hence the name
derivative instrument.</p>
<p><b>As the stock price increases, the price of a call
will increase and the price of the put will decrease
with all other factors constant.</b></p>
<p>This is a theoretical statement, so do not be alarmed
if your call option is not up with the underlying stock
trading higher.&nbsp; In fact, anybody who has traded options
for any length of time has experienced this.&nbsp; There are
sound reasons why this happens, so let's see if we can
make sense of it.</p>
<p>First of all, there are many strikes for any given
option.&nbsp; In fact, new strikes will be added if the stock
is moving, either up or down, significantly.&nbsp; If a stock
is trading at $120 up $2, a $100 strike will likely be
up a significant portion of that $2 -- maybe up $1-1/2
or so -- depending on the volatility and time remaining
on the option.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What about a $150 strike?&nbsp; Here, it is difficult to
say.&nbsp; We know it is worth more <i>theoretically</i>, but
it is up to the market to determine just how much. As an
analogy, say you are betting on a runner to complete a
twenty-six mile marathon and the runner has just taken
the first step across the start line.&nbsp; Do you adjust
your bet upward?&nbsp; Probably not, even though,
theoretically, the runner is closer to the finish line
than he was one step earlier.&nbsp; From a theoretical
viewpoint, you should be <i>a little</i> more confident
on your bet that he will complete it.&nbsp; It does not mean
you will adjust your bet.</p>
<p>This holds for the options, too.&nbsp; An option can be
thought of as a bet that the stock will cross the finish
line -- the strike -- by expiration.&nbsp; As the stock moves
higher, <u>all calls</u> become worth more
theoretically.&nbsp; Whether or not the market reflects added
value remains to be seen.</p>
<p>This same reasoning holds for puts, but in the
opposite direction.&nbsp; Because a put option confers the
right to sell stock, it should be worth more as the
stock moves lower.&nbsp; As the stock falls, all puts become
worth more theoretically.</p>
<h2>Exercise (or strike) price</h2>
<p>The exercise price is closely related to the stock
price.&nbsp; In fact, they are really just two ways of
looking at the same thing.&nbsp; When we were considering the
stock price above, we assumed the strike price remained
constant (as well as all other factors).&nbsp; Now, if we
hold the stock price constant but lower the strike,
effectively we are doing the same thing; that is, in
either case we are putting the call option more
in-the-money or at least in that direction.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>As the exercise price (strike price) is decreased,
calls become worth more and puts less with all other
factors constant.</b></p>
<p>By the same reasoning, as the exercise price is
raised, puts become worth more and calls will be worth
less.</p>
<p>Another way to understand this is by thinking of what
a call does.&nbsp; It gives you the right to purchase stock.&nbsp;
Now, would you rather buy stock for $100 per share or
$120 per share?&nbsp; Of course, you'd rather pay $100 and so
would everybody else in the market, so market
participants correspondingly bid the $100 strike higher,
which is just a reflection of the higher demand.</p>
<p>Similarly, a put option gives you the right to sell
your stock.&nbsp; Because everybody would rather get $120 per
share, investors bid the $120 put higher than the $100
strike.</p>
<h2>Interest rates</h2>
<p>How interest rates affect calls and puts are a little
more difficult to understand.&nbsp; It may be helpful to
think about the following analogy.&nbsp; Calls are a form of
<i>borrowing</i> money.&nbsp; Although you pay for the call
option, in effect you are borrowing funds.&nbsp; Here's why:&nbsp;
Say you buy a one-year $100 strike.&nbsp; You control all
stock prices above $100 for the next year but are not
obligated to pay him until one year from now.&nbsp; So
effectively you are borrowing money from the call
writer.&nbsp; Because interest rates affect the cost of carry
to the seller:</p>
<p><b>An increase in interest rates will increase the
price of a call option and decrease the price of a put
option with all other factors constant.</b></p>
<p>Although this is fairly easy to show mathematically,
it is easier to remember if you understand it
conceptually.&nbsp; So let's look at another line of
reasoning.</p>
<p>Say interest rates are very high -- 20%.&nbsp; You have
$100,000 in the money-market that you would like to
invest in stocks.&nbsp; You can either buy the stocks today,
or for a fee, buy a call option which gives you control
of the stock but allows you to defer payment.&nbsp; The
choice should be clear: buy the call option so you can
hang on to your money and continue to earn interest.&nbsp;
The markets follow this same line of reasoning and bid
the calls higher.</p>
<p>What about the puts?&nbsp; Puts give you the right to sell
your stock, which represents a cash flow into the
account, which is nice to have if interest rates are
really high.&nbsp; So do you elect to buy puts to defer the
sale?&nbsp; No, in fact, you may even <i>sell</i> the puts to
generate cash into the account so it can earn the high
rate of interest.&nbsp; Because few of the market
participants are willing to buy puts relative to those
wanting to sell them, the price of puts will fall.</p>
<p>There is one thing to be careful with here.&nbsp; All of
these factors we are discussing assume the other factors
remain constant.&nbsp; In the real world, this is rarely the
case.&nbsp; So if interest rates rise suddenly, do not be
surprised if your call options <u>decrease in price</u>
and don't increase as we have said so far.&nbsp; This is
usually due to the fact that <u>stock prices will fall</u>
with increases in interest rates.&nbsp; We know that falling
stock prices correspond with falling call prices.&nbsp; But
it should be evident that all factors did not stay the
same in this case -- we assumed interest rates rose <u>
and</u> stock prices fell.</p>
<h2>Volatility</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, volatility is the single-most
important factor of the Black-Scholes model.&nbsp; In fact,
it is the only true unknown in the equation.&nbsp; For
example, if you asked 10 different people what the stock
price is, they would all give you exactly the same
answer.&nbsp; Likewise, they would quote the same strike
price, risk-free rates of interest, and time remaining
on the option.&nbsp; However, what should they tell you is
the correct volatility measure for the stock?&nbsp; The
10-day average?&nbsp; The 20-day?&nbsp; The 50-day?&nbsp; Or should
they quote the projected expected future volatility?&nbsp; It
should be easy to see why this is the most important
factor in the model -- it is the only one that nobody
knows for sure.</p>
<p><b>If volatility increases, both call and put prices
will increase with all other factors the same.</b></p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking if volatility increases, the
stock becomes riskier.&nbsp; Why would somebody pay more for
a risky asset?&nbsp; After all, junk bonds trade for lower
prices than government bonds because of the risk.</p>
<p>The reason for the apparent contradiction is that
options have a limited downside; the owner can only lose
what they put into it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Look at the following diagram.&nbsp; Assume one investor
buys stock at $50 and another purchases a $50 call for
$5:</p>

<p>If you purchased stock at $50 and the stock closes at
$30, you are down $20.&nbsp; However, the call owner is only
down $5.&nbsp; In fact, that's the most the call owner can
lose; however, they can match the stock purchaser on
profit for all stock prices above $50.&nbsp; So more
volatility just means a higher expected return for the
option buyer -- whether calls or puts.&nbsp; So investors
will bid up the prices of options that are tied to risky
stocks.</p>
<h2>Time to expiration</h2>
<p>This factor is fairly straightforward.&nbsp; We said
earlier that an option could be viewed as a bet that the
stock will be above the strike price (for calls) or
below the strike price (for puts) by expiration.&nbsp; In
other words, you are in effect betting that the option
will have intrinsic value.&nbsp; Because of this, the more
time available, the more likely the stock will have
intrinsic value.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>The more time to expiration, the more valuable are
calls and puts.</b></p>
<p>From a trading standpoint, the more time you buy, the
better.&nbsp; This is because calls and puts become
increasingly cheaper (on a per month basis) the more
time you buy.&nbsp; For example, if a one-month option is
trading for $5, you would have to look at a four-month
option to double the price to $10.&nbsp; Many people think
that a two-month option would double the price but it
doesn't&nbsp; -- it takes four times the amount of time to
double the price.&nbsp; So the implication is that it becomes
a better and better deal for the option buyer to buy
time.&nbsp; Likewise, it becomes a worse and worse deal for
the options seller to sell longer-term options.</p>
<p>Please don't confuse this to mean that it is wrong to
sell longer-term options or that it's wrong to buy
little time because that's not necessarily true.&nbsp; It
depends on many factors with the particular strategy at
hand.&nbsp; All that is being said is that, everything else
constant, option buyers should buy lots of time and
option sellers should sell short amounts of time.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>Special note:&nbsp; There is one small point that
should be made here.&nbsp; It is possible for a
deep-in-the-money <u>European</u> put option to
become more valuable with the passage of time.&nbsp;
This is due to the fact that the European option
holder <u>must wait</u> to receive the cash from
the put.&nbsp; So a deep-in-the-money European put
will be worth the present value of the future
cash flow and will increase in price with the
passage of time.&nbsp; However, options on the equity
market (stocks) are always American style so
this caveat doesn't hold for most of our
discussions on equity trading strategies.&nbsp; Just
be aware that there is one exception to this
rule.</td>

<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>Last, we will consider the effect of dividends on
calls and puts.&nbsp; This one is also fairly
straightforward.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If a stock pays a dividend, the price of the stock is
reduced by the amount of the dividend (rounded to the
nearest 1/8th of a point) the next trading session.&nbsp; The
reason the price is reduced is because the company has
paid out cash -- one of its assets -- so is now worth
less than before it paid the dividend.&nbsp; For example, say
a $100 stock will pay a $1 dividend tomorrow.&nbsp; On the
opening, the stock will be trading for $99 unchanged
(this is considered to be unchanged since the fall is
not due to supply and demand factors).</p>
<p>Think about it for a moment. If the stock price is
down and all other factors stay the same, what will
happen to the call?&nbsp; You've got it, the call price will
fall.</p>
<p><b>Dividend increases cause call prices to fall and
put prices to rise with all other factors the same.</b></p>
<p>Why will put prices rise?&nbsp; Because the put owner can
force the seller to buy the stock, which is now worth
even less after the dividend is paid, so the put options
become more valuable.</p>
<p>The following table will help as a recap.&nbsp; The table
shows the effect on call and put prices with the six
factors being <u>up</u>.&nbsp; Of course, the reverse will be
true if the factors are down.</p>
