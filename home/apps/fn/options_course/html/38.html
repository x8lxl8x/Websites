<h1>Dividend Play</h1>

<p>One of the more interesting strategies is known as a
<i>dividend play</i>.&nbsp; It is ironic that it is nearly
risk-free yet entails a lot of uncertainty.&nbsp; It is
uncertain because you are betting on the move of the
trader on the opposite side of your position.</p>
<p>The dividend play strategy is executed by purchasing
stock and selling deep-in-the-money calls prior to
ex-date (the day the stock trades without the
dividend).&nbsp; Doing so creates a position where the trader
will break even as a worst-case scenario, but may
capture the dividend if the long call position fails to
exercise.</p>
<p>For example, say a stock is trading for $100 and is
about to pay a $1 dividend.&nbsp; Also assume that a $70 call
is trading for $30 (trading at parity).&nbsp; A trader can
buy the stock and sell the call for a net debit of $70.&nbsp;
On ex-date, the stock will fall by the amount of the
dividend to $99 causing the deep-in-the-money call to
fall to $29.&nbsp; The trader will lose $1 on the price of
the stock, but gain it back from the dividend.&nbsp; But the
short call can be purchased back for $1 less.&nbsp; Overall,
the trader profits by the amount of the dividend.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, if the trader is assigned, he will receive
$70 (the strike), which is the amount paid originally,
and break even.&nbsp; If not, he keeps the dividend.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>The transactions are as follows:<p>Long
Stock =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$100<br>
<u>Short $70 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;+$30</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $70</p>
<p>On ex-date, the account values are as
follows:</p>
<p>Stock = +$99 (stock price reduced by amount
of dividend)<br>
Short $70 call = -$29 (call price falls $1 due
to stock price reduced by dividend)<br>
<u>Dividend = +$1</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp; $71</p>
<p>The trader can now sell the stock for $99 and
buy back the short position for a total credit
of $70, which exactly offsets the original
debit.&nbsp; <i>In addition, he will keep the $1
dividend.</i></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
&nbsp;<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>Look back to the original position and now
assume the trader is, instead, assigned before
ex-date:<p>Original position:</p>
<p>Long Stock = &nbsp;&nbsp;+$100<br>
<u>Short $70 call =&nbsp; -$30</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$70</p>
<p>He will lose the stock from the assignment
but also lose the $30 obligation because the
call has been assigned.&nbsp; In exchange, he will
receive the $70 exercise price, which is exactly
what was paid originally.</p>
<p>Because of the low transaction costs, traders
see it as a low risk, but potentially profitable
trade.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Variations with vertical spreads</h2>
<p>There is a variation of the dividend play that uses
vertical spreads.&nbsp; For example, say the stock is $100
and the $65/$70 vertical spread (long $65 call and short
$70 call) is trading for $5 -- exactly the intrinsic
amount.</p>
<p>It is possible for a market maker to attempt to
purchase this spread at $5 even though there appears to
be no justification -- in most cases, you will pay $5
for the spread and sell it for $5, but pay two
commissions to do so.</p>
<p>So why would a market maker want to pay $5 for the
spread?&nbsp; They may exercise the $65 call and hope they
are not assigned on the $70 call.&nbsp; By exercising the day
before ex-date, they will capture the dividend of the
underlying.&nbsp; Of course, if assigned on the short $70
strike, they will lose the gains and break even.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table6'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>The transactions are as follows:<p>Long $65
call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$35<br>
<u>Short $70 call =&nbsp;+$30</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5</p>
<p>Trader exercises the $65 call and is now:</p>
<p>Exercise $65 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;-$65<br>
Long stock =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$100<br>
<u>Short $70 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$30</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5</p>
<p>Effectively, the trader has legged into a
covered call position (long stock plus a short
call).&nbsp; Notice that the long $65 call was
originally priced at <u>$35</u>.&nbsp; By using it to
buy stock, he is now long stock worth $100, but
paid $65 for it -- a net value of <u>$35</u>.&nbsp;
The market maker is simply changing the form of
the position and not the value.</p>
<h2>On ex-date:</h2>
<p>Long stock = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$34(remember, the trader
paid $65 for stock now worth $99)<br>
Short $70 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$29<br>
<u>Dividend&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$1</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$6</p>
<p>The trader gains by the amount of the $1
dividend.&nbsp; But assume he is assigned instead:</p>
<p>Now he will lose the stock and receive $70
for it.&nbsp; In addition, he will lose the short
call obligation due to the assignment.</p>
<p>Receive $70 strike =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$70<br>
Paid $65 for the stock =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>-$65</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Because the calls are both so deep-in-the-money, it
is possible to execute the same strategy with a short
vertical as well (sell the $65 call and buy the $70
call).&nbsp; In a similar fashion, the market maker will
exercise the $70 in an attempt to capture the dividend
and hope he is not assigned on the $65.&nbsp; If he is
assigned, he breaks even.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The market maker can take advantage of the strategy
with any deep-in-the-money call spread; he will exercise
whichever call is long and hope he is not assigned on
the other.</p>
<p>This strategy also explains why it is possible to see
quotes such as bid $5 and ask $5 for deep-in-the-money
call spreads.&nbsp; The market makers, in these cases, are
often trying to buy or sell the spread for $5 in an
attempt at a dividend play.</p>
<p>Remember, this strategy is only useful if you are
paying very low commissions.&nbsp; We mention it because it
is useful for understanding why you may see your stock
called the day before ex-dividend date.</p>
