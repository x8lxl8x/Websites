<h1>Spreads</h1>

<h2>Bull and bear spreads</h2>
<p>Spreads are strategies where the investor buys one
option and sells another.&nbsp; There are many different
types of spreads, and we will look at most of the major
strategies.&nbsp; Spreads get their name because you are, in
fact, spreading the risk when you enter into one of
these transactions.&nbsp; One of the positions, either the
long or the short, acts as a hedge and either makes the
position cheaper or acts as protection from a runaway
stock.&nbsp; We will look at this in a lot of detail later.&nbsp;
But for now, just understand that you are spreading the
risk and this, among other factors, is what makes
spreads so popular and powerful.</p>
<p>In most situations, the trader is buying and selling
an option in the same underlying stock or index.&nbsp; For
example, long MRVC $35 call and short MRVC $40 call.&nbsp;
These are collectively known as <i>intra-market</i>
spreads because they are spreading within the same
market.&nbsp; If you are long MRVC $35 and short INTC $45,
this is an <i>inter-market</i> spread.&nbsp; The intra-market
spreads are by far the most common and will be our only
focus.&nbsp; Just be aware that you do not have to be long
and short the same underlying for it to be considered a
spread.</p>

<p>Important note:&nbsp; A lot of references will be
made regarding pricing relationships about
options.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with basic
option pricing, you may want to read that
section first before continuing.</p>

<h2>The four basic spreads</h2>
<p>The most basic spreads are the bull spread and bear
spread.&nbsp; Each can be accomplished by using calls or puts
for a total of four basic spreads.&nbsp; If you understand
these four spreads, you will add an invaluable tool to
your arsenal of option strategies!</p>
<h2>Bull spreads</h2>
<p>As the name implies, bull spreads need an upward
movement in the stock to be profitable.&nbsp; The term <i>
bullish</i> actually gets its name from the way a bull
attacks; it lowers its horns and then raises its head --
from low to high.&nbsp; Bull spreads can be placed with
either calls or puts.</p>
<p><u>Bull spreads using calls</u><br>
The bull spread using calls is one of the most common
spreads.&nbsp; This strategy involves the purchase of a lower
strike call and the sale (equal number of contracts) of
a higher strike call with all other factors the same
(i.e., same underlying stock or index and time to
expiration).&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, a trader may buy 10 MRVC Jan $35 calls
and sell 10 MRVC Jan $40 calls.&nbsp; This is sometimes
referred to as a $35/$40 call bull spread.</p>
<p>Because the lower strike call will always be more
expensive than the higher strike [1],
this trade will result in a net debit.&nbsp; In order to make
up for this debit, the trader will need the stock to
move higher, hence the name bull spread.&nbsp; This spread is
also known as a debit spread, price spread or vertical
spread.&nbsp; We'll show you how to remember these names
later.&nbsp; </p>
<p>[1] Remember, calls give you the right
to purchase stock.&nbsp; With all else constant, investors
will prefer to pay less for a stock, so they'll bid up
the price of lower strike calls relative to the higher
strikes.&nbsp; Again, please refer to our section on &quot;Basic
Option Pricing&quot; for more information.</p>
<p>In this case, the trader is said to be long the
$35/$40 bull spread.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; As with any position, if you
buy it, you are long; if you sell it, you are short.&nbsp;
Because this trade resulted in a net debit (the trader
paid for it), the trader is long the spread.</p>
<p>In a call debit spread such as this one, the short
call (the $55 strike) acts as a way to bring in cash --
it reduces the cost basis of the long $50 strike.&nbsp; This
is a great tool for option trading as it can allow you
to buy lots of time without having to pay a lot of
money.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Say it is November, you are bullish on SCMR, trading
around $64, and want to buy 10 June $60 calls which are
currently trading for $20-1/2.&nbsp; That trade will cost you
$20,500 and could expire worthless.&nbsp; Because of the high
price, many people avoid buying time in options and
instead look at, say, a November $60 currently trading
for $8.&nbsp; That call will cost you $8,000 for 10
contracts.&nbsp; Now, granted you can lose less money with
the November contract; however, you have a much higher
probability of doing so.&nbsp; Is there a better way?&nbsp; Yes,
and the bull spread answers this problem for a lot of
traders.&nbsp; Let's do a bull spread with SCMR and see the
difference:</p>
<p>Buy 10 SCMR Jun $60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= $20 1/2<br>
Sell 10 SCMR Jun $65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<u>$18 1/4</u><br>
Net cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 2 1/4</p>
<p>Now, for only $2,250 expense, you will own 10
contracts <i>but</i> have all the way until June (8
months) to profit from it.&nbsp; Your tradeoff is that you
will not profit above $65, but, that's not so bad.&nbsp; If
the stock does get above $65 at expiration, this trade
will be worth $5 for $2-1/4 down, or a profit of 122% or
roughly 231% on an annualized basis.&nbsp; By using the
spread tactic, you reduce the time-decay of the position
and put the odds on your side that you will, in fact,
get a very healthy profit.</p>
<p>Because options are so versatile, spreads can be
versatile too.&nbsp; If you want more upside potential, maybe
sell the June $70 call instead:</p>
<p>Buy 10 SCMR Jun $60 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20 1/2<br>
Sell 10 SCMR Jun $70 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$16 7/8</u><br>
Net cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3 5/8</p>
<p>Here you will pay $3,625 for 10 contracts.&nbsp; Yes, you
now have more money at risk, but you also get more
reward in that you profit all the way to $70 instead of
$65.&nbsp; The financial adage &quot;more risk, more reward&quot;
cannot be escaped, even in the options market.&nbsp; You can
custom-tailor the spreads to exactly meet your needs.&nbsp;
If the stock reaches $70 or higher at expiration, this
trader will make $10 points for $3-5/8 initial
investment for a profit of 175%, or 358% annualized.</p>
<p>What does the position look like from a profit and
loss standpoint?&nbsp; (Please see our section on &quot;Profit and
Loss Diagrams&quot; if you are not familiar with these
diagrams.)</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/044.gif'>

<p>We can see that the most the trader can lose is the
$3-5/8 -- the amount paid.&nbsp; The most the spread can be
worth is $10 points, so the max gain must be the
difference or $6- 3/8.&nbsp; Where is the break-even point?&nbsp;
The trader needs to make back the $3-5/8 initially
paid.&nbsp; If the stock is trading for $63-5/8 at
expiration, the long call will be worth exactly $3-5/8
and the short call will be worthless; the break-even is
therefore $63-5/8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This trader will profit if the spread <i>widens</i>.&nbsp;
In other words, he wants the spread to increase in value
so that it can be sold for a profit.</p>
<p>No matter how high the stock goes above $70, the most
this trader will make is $6 3/8.&nbsp; The bull spread has a
limited downside as well as upside; the trader is trying
to capture the 10-point move between $60 and $70.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><u>Bull spreads using puts</u></b><br>
A bull spread with puts is a strategy where the trader
buys a low strike put and sells a higher strike put in
equal quantities.&nbsp; Because a higher strike put will
always be worth more (all else constant)[2],
this trade will result in a credit to the account.</p>
<p>[2] Put options give the owners the
right to sell stock.&nbsp; With all else constant, investors
prefer to sell for higher prices so they will bid up the
prices of higher strike puts relative to lower strike
puts.&nbsp; Again, please refer to our section on &quot;Basic
Option Pricing&quot; for more information.</p>
<p>For example, a trader may buy 10 MRVC $40 puts and
sell 10 MRVC $50 puts. This is also called a $40/$50 put
bull spread.</p>
<p>This spread is also known as a credit spread,
vertical spread, or price spread.</p>
<p>This trader is said to be short the $40/$50 bull
spread because of the resulting credit to the account.&nbsp;
This trader is hoping for the spread to &quot;shrink&quot; (as is
any short seller) so that it may be purchased back later
at a profit.&nbsp; How will a bull spread using puts shrink?&nbsp;
Only if the stock moves up (actually, this spread can
also profit by sitting still too; it just cannot move
down) hence the name bull spread.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Say you are bullish on MRVC trading at $39 1/2.&nbsp; You
elect to do the following bull spread with puts:</p>
<p>Buy 10 Apr $40 puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$12 1/2 <br>
Sell 10 Apr $50 puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$16 1/4</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3 3/4</p>
<p>You will receive a credit of $3,750 to your account
and will profit by this amount if the stock closes above
$50.&nbsp; If the stock is $50 or higher at expiration, both
puts expire worthless and the spread shrinks to zero --
exactly what you want it to do!</p>
<p>Let's look at the profit and loss diagram for the
short $40/$50 bull (credit) spread.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/045.gif'>

<p>It is easy to see, by looking at the chart, you will
make $3- 3/4 maximum; that's assuming the stock closes
at $50 or higher on expiration.&nbsp; However, this $3-3/4
credit does not come for free.&nbsp; In exchange, you must be
willing to assume a downside risk of $6-1/4.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Remember, the higher strike put is more valuable, and
that is the one you sold. &nbsp;If the stock falls, the
higher strike put becomes more valuable to the owner and
equally less valuable to you!&nbsp; But, if the stock
continues to fall below $40, then your long $40 put
starts to become valuable to you.&nbsp; So the spread can
only be worth $10 at a maximum to the owner or negative
$10 to you, the seller.&nbsp; Because you brought in $3-3/4
for the initial trade, the most you can lose is $10 -
$3-3/4 = $6-1/4.&nbsp; Where is the break-even point?&nbsp; You
took in $3-3/4 initially, right?&nbsp; So the $50 put can go
against you by this amount at expiration.&nbsp; So if the
stock is trading at $50 - $3-3/4 = $46-1/4 at
expiration, then your short $50 put will be worth
negative $3-3/4 to you, and your long put will be
worthless; you will just break even.</p>
<p>Notice also, that the above two profit and loss
charts have exactly the same shape.&nbsp; This is another way
to identify a bull spread, as they will always have this
similar shape.</p>
<h2>Which is better -- the credit or debit spread?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of people and books that claim there
is no difference between the two types of spreads.&nbsp; This
is totally false.&nbsp; There is a big difference in the
underlying assumptions, depending on what they are, the
call or put spread will be better suited.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We saw that, for the debit spread, the trader <u>must
have the stock move higher</u> as the trader must make
up for the debit.&nbsp; The credit spread; however, <u>does
not need the stock to move; it just cannot move down.</u>&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>PWAV is currently $44-1/2.&nbsp; Let's compare the debit
and credit spreads:</p>
<p><u>Debit Spread</u><br>
Buy Dec $45 Call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6 7/8<br>
Sell Dec $50 Call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$4 1/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2 5/8</p>
<p><u>Credit Spread</u><br>
Buy Jun $40 Put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4 3/4<br>
Sell Jun $45 Put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$6 3/4</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2</p>
<p>The trader using calls (debit spread) will pay $2-5/8
while one using the puts (credit spread) will receive
$2.&nbsp; If the stock sits still, the call trader will <u>
lose</u> $2-5/8 while the put trader will <u>gain</u>
$1-1/2.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; If the stock is still $44- 1/2 at
expiration, both calls will be worthless; the long bull
spread will lose the entire premium. </p>
<p>For the credit spread, if the stock is $44-1/2 at
expiration, the short put will be worth -$1/2 and the
long put worthless.&nbsp; The credit spreader will take a
loss of $1/2 from the short position, but keep the $2
from the initial trade for a gain of $1- 1/2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So is the credit spread the best?&nbsp; After all, in this
example, it seems like you get the best of both worlds.&nbsp;
You get paid for the position, and you don't need the
stock to move in order to profit.&nbsp; Here's the catch, if
you are wrong in your assumption about the direction of
the stock and it falls, the debit spread can only lose
the amount of the debit or $2-5/8 while the credit
spread can lose $3.</p>
<p>The differences in the two types of spreads, either
debit or credit, have to do with your assumptions on how
quickly the underlying stock will move (please see our
section on deltas and gammas for further details).</p>
<h2>Cheap or chicken</h2>
<p>You may have noticed something about the two spreads
we have been discussing.&nbsp; The debit trader is really
only interested in purchasing the more valuable call.&nbsp;
By entering the spread, the trader can <u>reduce the
premium</u> paid for this long position.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For the credit spreader, their goal is to short the
more valuable strike and receive a premium; however, the
trader is now exposed to potentially unlimited losses.&nbsp;
So by entering the spread, they <u>hedge</u> themselves
in case the stock moves the other way.</p>
<p>There is a somewhat comical, although valuable way of
understanding the philosophies between credit or debit
spreads.&nbsp; We can say the debit spreader is &quot;cheap&quot; since
they do not want to pay a lot for the long call position
by itself.&nbsp; Selling the higher strike reduces the price.</p>
<p>For the credit spreader, they are &quot;chicken,&quot; as their
goal is to short the more valuable strike.&nbsp; But they are
fearful of the unlimited downside risk, so buying
another position gives them a hedge.</p>
<p>So remember &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;chicken&quot; to help identify the
underlying philosophies!</p>
<h2>Bear spreads</h2>
<p>A bear spread, as the name implies, desires the stock
or index to fall.&nbsp; The term <i>bearish</i> gets its name
from the way a bear attacks; it raises its paws and
strikes down -- from high to low.&nbsp; As with the bull
spreads, bear spreads can be executed through calls or
puts.</p>
<h2>Bear spread using puts</h2>
<p>This strategy involves the purchase of a high strike
put and the sale of a lower strike put with all other
factors the same.</p>
<p>Because you are buying the higher strike put, it will
always be worth more and result in a debit.&nbsp; In order
for the trade to make money, the stock must fall --
hence the name bear spread.</p>
<p>Let's say you are bearish on INTC; you think the
price will fall.&nbsp; You could enter the following spread:</p>
<p>Buy Apr $45 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $6 1/2<br>
Sell Apr $35 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$2 1/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4 1/4</p>
<p>This trader would be long the $45/40 bear spread.&nbsp; As
before, this trader is long because a premium is paid.</p>
<p>Let's run through the idea of the spread again.&nbsp; This
trader is really interested in owning the $45 strike
because it is the most valuable of the two puts.&nbsp;
However, he does not want to pay $6-1/2.&nbsp; By entering
the spread, he can own it for only $4-1/4.&nbsp; Using our
&quot;cheap or chicken&quot; method, this trader is &quot;cheap.&quot;&nbsp; The
tradeoff is that he can only profit to a fall of $35.</p>
<p>At expiration, if INTC is $45 or higher, this trader
loses the entire premium of $4-1/4.&nbsp; If the stock is $35
or below, the trader will make the full spread of $10
less the amount paid of $4-1/4 for a total profit of
$5-3/4.&nbsp; In order to break even, the trader must be able
to sell the long position for $4-1/4, which means the
stock will have to be this amount in-the-money or
$40-3/4.&nbsp; As with any debit spread, this trader wants
the spread to widen so that it may be sold for a profit.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these numbers on the profit and
loss diagram:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/046.gif'>

<p>The chart confirms what we figured out intuitively.&nbsp;
Also notice that the bear spread profit and loss diagram
is opposite that of the bull diagrams above.&nbsp; The bear
spread profits from a downward move in the stock.</p>
<h2>Bear spread using calls</h2>
<p>This trader is really only interested in shorting
(selling) the $45 call.&nbsp; However, because of the
unlimited risk to the upside, he buys a $55 call for
protection.&nbsp; This follows the &quot;chicken&quot; philosophy.&nbsp; Now
it should be evident why the trader would spend the
money to buy the $55 call.</p>
<p>For example, a trader could buy a $50 call and sell a
$45.&nbsp; Because the lower strike will always be more
valuable, this trade will result in a credit.</p>
<p>Let's use INTC again but with calls instead.</p>
<p>Sell Apr $45 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$8 1/8<br>
Buy Apr $55 call=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>$4 5/8</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3 1/2</p>
<p>At expiration, if INTC is below $45, both puts expire
worthless and the trader will profit by the $3-1/2
credit.&nbsp; If the stock is above $55, the trader will lose
$10 on the spread, but will offset this loss by the
initial premium for a net loss of $6-1/2.&nbsp; In order to
break even, the trader can afford to have the lower
strike call move $3-1/2 points against him for a closing
stock price of $48-1/2 at expiration.&nbsp; At this point, he
will owe $3-1/2 for the short position, which exactly
offsets the original premium so he breaks even.</p>
<p>The following profit and loss diagram should confirm
this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/047.gif'>

<p>Again, as expected, this bear spread has the same
shape as the bear spread above.&nbsp; We see that the maximum
profit is in fact $3-1/2 and the maximum loss is $6-1/2.</p>
<p>Because this trader received a credit from the
initial transaction, he wants the spread to narrow so
that it can be purchased back cheaper or expire
worthless.&nbsp; Either way will result in a profit.</p>
<h2>A word of caution</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes investors make using
spreads is to fail to understand the risk-reward
concept.&nbsp; This usually leads to unsuitable trades based
on the investor's risk-reward profile or outlook on the
stock.&nbsp; Let's look at an example:</p>
<p>INTC is now trading for $44-7/8 with the following
quotes for December available:</p>
<p>$35/$40 spread =;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4 1/4<br>
$40/$45 spread =;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3 3/8<br>
$45/$50 spread =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2 1/2<br>
$55/$60 spread =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$11/16</p>
<p>Novice investors will look at quotes such as these
and think the $55/$60 spread is the best because they
pay only $11/16 and can make a maximum of $5 on the
spread for a $4-5/16 profit.&nbsp; It certainly sounds better
than paying $4-1/4 for the $35/$40 spread and only
making $3/4 profit. </p>
<p>The reason the $55/$60 spread is relatively cheap is
because it is an out-of-the-money spread; remember, the
stock is trading at $44-7/8 so neither option is
in-the-money.&nbsp; It is a higher risk strategy, relative to
the other spreads listed, so it should be trading for a
cheaper price and have a higher reward.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The $35/$40 spread is an in-the-money spread as both
options have intrinsic value.&nbsp; This spread will grow to
a maximum of $5 without the stock moving -- just as long
as the stock does not fall below $40 by expiration.&nbsp; It
is much less risky than the other two spreads so should
be trading for a higher price and have a lower reward.</p>
<p>When looking at profit and loss diagrams on spreads,
you can immediately see the relative risk in
strategies.&nbsp; Take a look at the profit and loss diagrams
for the four spreads listed above:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/048.gif'>

<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table10'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/049.gif'>

<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table11'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/050.gif'>

<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table12'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/051.gif'>

<p>You can see the $35/$40 spread in the upper left
(red) has a large loss area and a low reward area.&nbsp; As
the spreads move more out-of-the-money, the profit and
loss line shifts upward to reflect a lower loss and
higher reward.&nbsp; For example, look at the $55/$60 spread
in the lower right (orange).&nbsp; It has only an $11/16 loss
but a $4-5/16 reward, which certainly sounds appealing.</p>
<p>This is where the mistake is made.&nbsp; Again, most
novice investors immediately jump to the $55/$60, in
this example, because of the amount of profit that can
be made relative to the amount invested.&nbsp; Remember, you
cannot get around the risk-reward relationship!&nbsp; With
the $35/$40 spread, you will <u>probably keep</u> the
$1/4 profit; with the $55/60 spread, you will <u>
probably lose</u> the $11/16.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that either spread is right or
wrong.&nbsp; Just be careful that you are picking the correct
one that matches your opinion of the move in the
underlying stock.</p>
<p>One final note of caution: in the above example, we
looked at a $35/$40 spread that cost $4-3/4 and could
yield 1/4 profit.&nbsp; Even though you will probably keep
the 1/4 point, be sure to factor in commissions before
entering into low yielding spreads such as this.&nbsp; The
commissions will, in many cases, lock you into a loss.&nbsp;
Low profit spreads are common with floor traders as they
may only pay a couple of bucks in commissions and they
are really stacking the odds on their side that they
will make a profit.&nbsp; For retail investors, you need to
be sure the commissions are not too high.</p>
<p>Spreads that lock you into a loss are entertainingly
called <i>alligator spreads</i> -- as you will never get
out alive!</p>
<h2>Bull and bear spreads -- how can I keep all these
names straight?</h2>
<p>It can be confusing to remember which strategies are
bullish and which are bearish, especially if you are new
to spreads.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is a really neat device
that will help you remember!</p>
<p>Whenever you <b>B</b>UY a <b>L</b>OW <u>strike</u>
and <b>S</b>ELL a <b>H</b>IGH <u>strike</u>, remember
BLSH, which looks like &quot;Bullish&quot; and you'll get the
right answer.&nbsp; Of course, the reverse is true too.&nbsp; If
you buy the high strike and sell the low strike, it is a
bearish strategy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This method works for calls or puts so it can be very
helpful.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>Buy $40 call and sell a $45 call.<br>
You are buying the low <u>strike</u> and selling the
high <u>strike</u>, so it is a bull spread.</p>
<p>Buy $120 put and sell $100 put.<br>
You are buying the high <u>strike</u> and selling the
low, so it is a bear spread.</p>
<p>Buy $40 put and sell $45 put.<br>
You are buying the low <u>strike</u> and selling the
high, so it is bullish.</p>
<p>Buy $50 call and sell the $40 call.<br>
You are buying the high <u>strike</u> and selling the
low for a bearish position.</p>
<p>Be careful with this method though.&nbsp; A lot of people
remember the &quot;BLSH&quot; mnemonic but often forget that it is
in relation to the <u>strike prices.</u>&nbsp; It is very
easy to look at the <u>price</u> of the option and this
is incorrect; in fact, it will get you the exact
opposite answer!</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Earlier we looked at the following trade:</p>
<p>Buy 10 SCMR Jun $60 = $20-1/2<br>
Sell 10 SCMR Jun $65 = $18-1/4</p>
<p>It is easy for people to look at the prices of the
options instead of the strikes.&nbsp; In this case, they may
think we are buying high ($20-1/2) and selling low
($18-1/4) and think it is a bearish strategy -- exactly
the opposite!</p>
<p>Just be careful and remember that the BLSH method
works great -- for calls or puts -- <i>if</i> you use it
in relation to the strike prices.</p>
<h2>How to remember the different kinds of spreads</h2>
<p>There are many names for spreads, and some are used
interchangeably.&nbsp; If you understand where these names
come from, it will help you to identify the type of
trade.&nbsp; For example, you may hear the following names
for different spreads: price, time, vertical,
horizontal, calendar, time and diagonal just to name a
few.&nbsp; So how do you remember them?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you look at option quotes in your local paper, you
will most likely see a similar grid with the months
across the top and the strikes down the side:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table13'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/052.gif'>

<p>Now, look at the Jan $50 and Jan $60 highlighted in
red.&nbsp; Depending on which one you buy and sell, it could
be either a bull or bear spread.&nbsp; Because it's also
spread on the vertical axis, it can be called a <i>
vertical spread</i> or <i>price spread </i>,&nbsp;because it
is the prices that are being spread.</p>
<p>So all the bull and bear spreads that we've talked
about are also vertical spreads or price spreads.</p>
<p>If you spread horizontally such as the Mar $55 and
Feb $55 in blue, then this is known as a <i>horizontal
spread</i>, <i>calendar spread</i>, or <i>time spread</i>
because we are actually spreading time, not price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Lastly, if we spread time and price such as the Mar
$65 and Feb $70 in green, what do you think it's
called?&nbsp; You've got it, that's a diagonal spread!</p>
<p>As always, if any of these spreads results in a net
debit, the trader is said to be long the spread and
short if it results in a credit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are just the basics of spreads. There are many
more strategies involving spreads listed on our Web
Site.&nbsp; We hope you take the time to learn more about
them.</p>
