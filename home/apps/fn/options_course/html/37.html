<h1>Ex-Dividend Dates</h1>

<p>As you invest in stocks, you will encounter the words
&quot;ex-dividend date.&quot; This is a term that is important to
understand -- what it is and how it works. Ex-dividend
dates govern who gets dividends, split shares, spin-off
shares, or any other form of payment or distribution
from the company.</p>
<p>Many option strategies depend on the payment of a
dividend on the underlying stock and, if you miss the
payment, the strategy could be shot. Even if you are not
using options, it helps to understand ex-dividend dates
if you wish to collect a dividend on a stock.</p>
<p>Many stocks pay dividends, which are simply
distributions of cash given to shareholders. If a stock
pays a 10-cent dividend and you own 100 shares, you will
receive 100 shares * 0.10 = $10 from the company.</p>
<p>In fact, stock <i>splits</i> are really just
dividends paid in the form of stock. If you have 100
shares and they split 2:1, your account statement will
show a 1-<i>share</i> dividend paid on your statement.
That just means that you received 1 share for each share
owned. In this example, you'd receive 100 shares * 1
share dividend = 100 shares, which when added to your
original 100 shares equals 200 shares and is what you'd
expect after a 2:1 split on 100 shares.</p>
<p>There's no question as to who gets the dividends (or
split shares) if you've been the one holding the stock
all along. But what if you purchased the stock close to
the time the dividend is paid? Will you get it or will
it be the person who sold the stock?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to know the
ex-dividend date.</p>
<h2>What Is the Ex-Dividend Date?</h2>
<p>The ex-dividend date, also called the <i>ex-date</i>,
is the date the stock trades <i>without</i> the
dividend. Just remember that &quot;ex&quot; means <i>without</i>,
and you will not be prone to one of the most common
mistakes made by investors (and brokers too). </p>
<p>Let's say a stock is about to pay a dividend, and the
ex-date is June 10. If you buy the stock on June 10 or
later, you <u>will not</u> get that upcoming dividend.
Remember, ex means without. If you buy the stock <u>on</u>
the ex-date (or later), you are buying the stock <u>
without</u> that dividend.</p>
<p>If you buy the stock before June 10, you <u>will</u>
get the upcoming dividend when it is paid. </p>
<p>If you just focus on the ex-date and nothing else, it
is very easy to determine who gets the dividend and who
does not.</p>
<h2>More Examples:</h2>
<p>1) ABC stock will pay a 5-cent dividend and the
ex-date is August 18. You sell your shares on August 18.
Will you get the dividend?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The <i>buyer</i> of your shares
purchased them on the ex-date. They purchased the shares
without the dividend, which means you are entitled to
it.</p>
<p>2) Using the above example, what if you sold your
shares on August 17 or before?</p>
<p>Answer: You will not get the dividend. The buyer of
your shares is purchasing them before the ex-date, which
means they are entitled to it.</p>
<p>If you want to receive the upcoming dividend, you
must purchase the shares <u>before</u> that ex-date.
Likewise, if you are selling your shares but want to
receive the upcoming dividend, you must sell those
shares <u>on or after</u> the ex-date.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can see how straightforward dividends
can be if you just concentrate on the ex-date.</p>
<h2>Why Is There So Much Confusion in Practice?</h2>
<p>The reason for all the confusion is that when a
dividend is announced, there are usually three dates
associated with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record date
</li>
<li>Ex-date
</li>
<li>Payable date </li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, companies only publish the <i>record date</i>
and <i>payable date</i> in the newspaper. In many cases,
the companies will not even be able to tell you what the
ex-date is, even if you call investor relations, and
we'll show you why shortly.</p>
<p>The only date that matters to the company is the
record date. Before the company pays the dividend, they
look up a list of names of all investors who are owners
of their stock as of the <u>record</u> date and pay the
dividends to those names. For example, XYZ may announce
they will pay a dividend to all shareholders of record
as of March 15. If you <u>own</u> the stock as of this
date or before, you will get the upcoming dividend.</p>
<p><b><i>Here's where the confusion sets in for most
investors... </i></b></p>
<p>In order to be the owner of record, the stock
transaction must be <u>settled</u> by the record date.
Keep in mind there is currently a <u>three-business day</u>
settlement period! If you want to be a record holder as
of March 15, you need to purchase it as of March 12
(assuming those are business days with no holidays). If
you purchase the stock on March 12, the stock
transaction will settle on March 15, and you will be
owner of record as of March 15. Now you can see where
all the confusion comes from. It all has to do with the
timing of the settlement period.</p>
<h2>Back to the Ex-Date</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the ex-date was created by brokerage
firms to mathematically figure out the purchase date
that makes you owner by the record date. In the previous
example, March 13 would be the ex-date. If you purchase
on or before March 12, you will be owner of record by
March 15.</p>
<p>Corporations are not stockbrokers and they are not,
in many cases, even aware of the three-business day
settlement period. They only publish the record date.
This is why most firms will not even be able to tell you
what the ex-date is.</p>
<p>Many investors believe if they purchase shares on or
before the record date, they will get the dividend. This
is false! In the previous example we said March 13 was
the ex-date. If you purchase your shares on March 13, it
will settle three business days later on March 16 -- one
day too late. The stock will not settle by March 15, and
you will not get the dividend. </p>
<p>Hopefully you see how much easier it is if you just
focus on the ex-date, which you may have to call your
broker to get. If you wish to focus on the record date,
that's okay too, but just be sure you are purchasing the
stock far enough in advance to make <u>settlement by the
record date</u>.</p>
<h2>Stock Splits</h2>
<p>As mentioned, stock splits are really nothing more
than dividends. If a stock is about to split 2:1 and you
want to get the split shares, you can call your broker
and ask for the ex-date, which we'll assume is May 10
for this example. If you buy 100 shares <u>before</u>
May 10, you will end up with 200 shares. If you buy 100
shares <u>on</u> May 10 (or later), you will buy the
shares at the cheaper price but will not get the
additional shares.</p>
<h2>Does It Matter If I Get the Dividend?</h2>
<p>In most cases, it doesn't even matter if you get the
dividend or not. Many new to investing find this hard to
believe. After all, it certainly seems like you'd be
better off buying the stock and getting the dividend
rather than not getting the dividend, right?</p>
<p>The reason there is not a difference is that the
stock price is reduced by the amount of the dividend
(rounded up to the nearest 1/8) on the ex-date! For
instance, say a stock closes at $100 on March 19 and is
scheduled to pay a $2 dividend with an ex-date of March
20. On March 20, the stock will open at $98 <i>unchanged</i>
to reflect the $2 dividend that was paid. The reason the
stock will show unchanged is because the drop in price
from $100 to $98 was due to the dividend and not changes
in supply and demand for the stock.</p>
<p>Let's compare two investors: one who buys the stock
before ex-date and another who buys it on the ex-date.
You will be convinced there is no difference. </p>
<p>The investor who buys before the ex-date will pay
$100 for the stock and receive a $2 dividend. The stock,
however, will trade for $98 on the ex-date, and the
total value of the position will still be $100 ($98 in
stock and $2 in cash). This investor is down $2 in the
value of the stock, which is offset by the $2 dividend.</p>
<p>A second investor who buys the stock on the ex-date
will only pay $98 for the position and not receive the
dividend. While they are not down $2 on the value of the
stock, they did not receive the dividend either. Both
investors are holding stock worth $98, and neither
investor is down overall.</p>
<p>So it doesn't really matter mathematically whether
you get the dividend or not (although there could be tax
benefits to one choice over the other).</p>
<h2>Rules Violation: Selling Dividends</h2>
<p>Many brokers take advantage of investors by touting
an immediate return on your money by purchasing stock
just before the ex-date. Using the above example, a
broker may call and say, &quot;If you buy this stock for
$100, you will get an immediate 2% return on your money
the very next day.&quot; By now you should understand why
this is not true.</p>
<p>If you buy the stock for $100, it will be worth $98
the next day, and you will have $2 in cash for a total
position value of $100, which is neither a gain nor a
loss. If this were really an immediate return of 2%, the
position would be worth $102 the following day.</p>
<p>Further, buying the stock just to get the dividend is
a bad idea for tax reasons. If you buy one share of
stock for $100, you are paying with <i>after-tax</i>
dollars; you do not owe taxes on the $100. However, if
you buy the stock, the very next day your position is
still worth $100, yet you owe taxes on $2. Basically,
the dividend represents an immediate taxable return of
capital (where previously there was none) and not a
return on your money.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the NASD prohibits brokers from
selling you stock solely for the reason of getting the
dividend. Obviously, if the broker thinks the stock is
going to be much higher in the next day or two and
recommends buying it for that reason, that's okay. They
just cannot sell you the stock based solely on the
immediate return of the dividend. If they do, they are
guilty of &quot;selling dividends&quot; and in violation of NASD
rule 2830, which states:</p>
<p><b>NASD Rule 2830 (e):</b> No member shall, in
recommending the purchase of investment company
securities, state or imply that the purchase of such
securities shortly before an ex-dividend date is
advantageous to the purchaser, unless there are
specific, clearly described tax or other advantages to
the purchaser, and no member shall represent that
distributions of long-term capital gains by an
investment company are or should be viewed as part of
the income yield from an investment in such company's
securities.</p>
<p>While some option strategies rely on payments of
dividends (please see &quot;Dividend Play&quot; in this week's
courses), keep in mind that you will never receive
dividends from holding options. If you own a call option
and wish to receive a dividend, you must exercise the
call option and take delivery of the underlying stock
before the record date. </p>
<h2>A Real Life Example</h2>
<p>The following is an excerpt from a Business Wire news
article:</p>
<p>FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Dec. 14, 2001
-- The Board of Directors of GE today raised the
Company's quarterly dividend 13% to $0.18 per
outstanding share of its common stock and increased its
share repurchase program to $30 billion from $22
billion.</p>
<p>&quot;GE has paid a dividend every year since 1899,&quot; said
GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. &quot;Today's increases, in
both our dividend and our share repurchase program,
signal our confidence in our ability to extend this
track record of returning value to shareowners.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dividend increase, from $0.16 per share, marks
the 26th consecutive year in which GE has increased its
dividend. The dividend is payable January 25, 2002, to
shareowners of record on December 31, 2001. The
ex-dividend date is Thursday, December 27.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Questions:</b></p>
<p>1) If you buy 100 shares of GE on December 27, will
you get the dividend?</p>
<p>2) What is the last day you could purchase the stock
and get the dividend? If you buy 100 shares, how much
money will you receive? When will you receive it?</p>
<p>3) Why do you suppose there are four days between the
ex-date and the record date?</p>
<p><b>Answers:</b></p>
<p>1) No. December 27 is the ex-date, and you will not
get the dividend if you buy on or after this date.</p>
<p>2) The last date you could purchase shares to get the
dividend is December 26. If you have 100 shares, you
will receive 100 * 0.18 = $18.</p>
<p>3) Notice that the ex-date is Thursday. This means
that the last day to buy the stock and get the dividend
is Wednesday. If you buy on Wednesday, the stock will
settle three business days later on Monday, December 31,
which the article shows as the record date.</p>
<h2>Using Options to Take Delivery</h2>
<p>If you wish to take delivery of the stock in order to
get the dividend, you should wait as long as possible
(please see our course in week 1 on &quot;Early Exercise&quot; for
reasons why you should wait as long as possible) and
exercise the call option the day before the ex-date. You
must exercise the option the day <i>before</i> the
ex-date because options take one day to settle, which
will be on the ex-date. At that time, the stock will be
delivered in three business days with your name as owner
of record. As always, if there are any questions, you
should contact your broker <i>before</i> entering the
trade.</p>
<p>In cases where you are trying to capture a dividend
(or avoid one), focus on the ex-date, and there will be
no unwanted surprises!</p>
