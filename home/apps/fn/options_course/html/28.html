<h1>Long Call</h1>

<h2>Long and short calls</h2>
<p>A long call option gives the buyer the right, but not
the obligation, to purchase stock for a fixed price over
a given amount of time.&nbsp; It is the call buyer that has
the right to purchase stock; the short call seller has
the obligation to sell stock if the long position
exercises their option.&nbsp; There should be no concern for
default by the short side as the Options Clearing
Corporation (OCC) guarantees the performance of the
contract.</p>
<p>The long call strategy is therefore bullish, as the
value of the call rises with increases in the underlying
stock.&nbsp; Please understand that when we say call prices
rise as the stock rises, this is assuming that all other
factors stay the same.&nbsp; It is quite possible for calls
to fall in value as the stock rises due to time or
volatility decreasing.</p>
<p>Investors are typically attracted to the long call
strategy for two main reasons:</p>
<p>1) Leverage</p>
<p>2) Protection (hedge)</p>
<p>Long call options provide leverage, that is, they
cost far less to control shares of stock as compared to
an outright purchase; therefore, their performances will
be magnified (up or down) relative to the stock.&nbsp; They
also provide protection by limiting your downside risk.</p>
<h2>Example:&nbsp; </h2>
<p>You are bullish on MRVC trading for $39-1/2.</p>
<p>If you want to buy 1,000 shares, it will cost you
$39,500.&nbsp; You could, instead, buy 10 January $40 calls
which are trading for $9-1/2.&nbsp; This would cost you
$9,500.</p>
<p>If the stock is trading at $60 by expiration, the
long stock position would be worth $60,000 while the
call would be worth $20.</p>
<h2>Leverage</h2>
<p>Your return on the long stock is 52% (not annualized)
while the return on the option is 110% (not
annualized).&nbsp; This is what they mean by leverage.&nbsp; The
investor who bought the call options, in this example,
more than doubled the returns as compared to the long
stock position.</p>
<h2>Protection</h2>
<p>What if the stock falls substantially?&nbsp; The long
stock position has $39,500 at risk, which,
theoretically, could end up at zero.&nbsp; The long call only
has $9,500 at risk.&nbsp; This is what is meant when you hear
that long call options provide protection -- they limit
your downside risk.&nbsp; The long call position is
controlling the same number of shares (1,000) for
$30,000 less at risk ($9,500 vs. $39,500).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the long stock position, in
this example, while beaten in return on investment (50%
vs. 110%) would never lose in terms of <i>total dollars</i>.&nbsp;
For example, the long stock position earned $60,000 -
$39,500 = $20,500, while the long call earned $20,000 -
$9,500 = $10,500.&nbsp; The long stock position earned nearly
twice the amount of dollars, which is why its return is
roughly half the return for the long call.&nbsp; So be
careful in your understanding when you hear that options
beat stock in terms of returns.&nbsp; Assuming two investors
are controlling the <u>same number of shares</u>, the
option will outperform stock in terms of return on
investment and not total dollars.</p>
<p>What if our long call position puts the same dollars
at risk as the long stock position?&nbsp; Long stock would
have cost $39,500 so, for that money, the call option
buyer could purchase 41 contracts (controlling 4,100
shares) at $9-1/2.&nbsp; Now, the call position will be worth
4100 * $20 = $82,000 at expiration.&nbsp; The return on
investment is back to the 110% as in the example above.&nbsp;
However, this option investor is controlling 4,100
shares and not 1,000.&nbsp; This is another way to view
leverage; for the same dollar investment, one can
control more shares through the options market.</p>
<p>So regardless of how you cut it, options do provide
leverage!</p>
<h2>Profit and loss diagram</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/028.gif'>

<p>We can see the effect of the protection by the profit
and loss diagram above (if you are not sure how to read
this chart, please see our section under &quot;Profit and
Loss Diagrams&quot;).&nbsp; Again, the most the option investor
can lose, in our original example, is the $9,500 paid
for the 10 contracts.&nbsp; Yet, they participate in all of
the upside returns above the $40 strike price.</p>
<p>This added downside protection does not come for
free.&nbsp; We can also see that the break-even point is
raised from $39-1/2 to $49 for the call buyer.</p>
<h2>Strategies using long calls</h2>
<p>One very useful strategy that many investors use is
that of diversification through call options.&nbsp; For
example, say you have $50,000 to invest and would like
500 shares each of ten great companies.&nbsp; The good news
is you will probably make money over the long term; the
bad news is this may cost you $300,000.&nbsp; Well, with long
calls you <u>can</u> invest in all of them for $50,000
or less.&nbsp; Now you have a lot of diversification without
the need for a lot of money to achieve it.</p>
<h2>Deep-in-the-money-calls</h2>
<p>Probably one of the most underutilized strategies in
options is that of long deep-in-the-money calls as a
substitute for long stock.&nbsp; Using our previous example,
MRVC is trading at $39-1/2.&nbsp; We were looking at the $40
strike for $9-1/2.&nbsp; However, this is all time-premium as
the stock is still below the strike price.&nbsp; So there is
substantial risk if the stock does not move quickly
enough (please see our section on deltas and gammas).&nbsp;
This is why we saw the break-even point pushed to $49 in
the profit and loss diagram.</p>
<p>Let's say we have two traders with $40,000 to
invest.&nbsp; The first trader buys 1,000 shares MRVC at $40
for a total outlay of $40,000.&nbsp; The second trader buys a
deep-in-the-money call such as the Jan $20 trading for
$21-3/8 for a total price of $21,375, and leaves the
remaining $18,625 in the money-market.</p>
<p>The second investor who buys this option will be
participating nearly point-for-point to the upside just
like the long stock position that paid $40,000.&nbsp; But
let's say the stock falls substantially -- down to
nearly $20.&nbsp; Now the long stock position is down $20
points, while the long call position is down <u>less</u>
than this.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because now the option is more
at-the-money and the time premium is <u>increasing</u>;
it provides a crutch for the option holder.&nbsp; So long
deep-in-the-money option holders enjoy the benefit of
point-for-point upside movement and less than
point-for-point downside.&nbsp; In the worst-case scenario,
the first investor is bankrupt while the second investor
still has $18,625 sitting safely in the money-market.</p>
<p>Think about how powerful this strategy can be
especially for those volatile tech stocks you may be
trading.&nbsp; You participate in all of the gains to the
upside but not to the downside.&nbsp; It's a tough strategy
to beat.</p>
<h2>Short calls</h2>
<p>The strategy behind the <u>naked</u> (or uncovered)
short call is neutral to bearish.&nbsp; The investor is
betting that the stock will either fall or sit still.&nbsp;
</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Important note!</b>&nbsp; This is very
different from the short call against long stock
position (covered call strategy), which is <u>
neutral to bullish</u>.&nbsp; All too often investors
make the big mistake of hearing &quot;short call&quot; and
immediately associate the covered call as a
bearish position.&nbsp; Things change when you start
pairing options with other positions!&nbsp; So please
keep in mind that we are talking about naked, or
uncovered, calls in this section.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When selling naked (uncovered) calls, the investor
takes in the premium, and in exchange is willing to
assume the upside risk of the stock.&nbsp; Let's take a look
at the profit and loss diagram assuming the MRVC
investor above shorts 10 Jan $40 calls at $9-1/2:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/029.gif'>

<p>We see the maximum this investor can make is the $
9-1/2 points, or $9,500 for 10 contracts.&nbsp; The investor
is also exposed to unlimited upside exposure if the
stock continues to climb above $49 1/2.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The
investor starts to lose profits for any stock price
above $40 -- the strike -- at expiration.&nbsp; However,
because of the $9-1/2 points we received as an initial
credit, the investor can afford to have the stock rise
to $40 + $9-1/2 = $49-1/2 before losses will be
incurred.&nbsp; It should be evident that this is among the
most dangerous of all option positions!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Long call options are among the most basic of
strategies, yet are very powerful due to the leverage.&nbsp;
They are relatively easy to understand, so they're
usually the first option trade for most investors.&nbsp;
However, be sure to see our sections on &quot;Deltas and
Gammas&quot; and &quot;Implied Volatility&quot; before entering into a
long or short call position.</p>
