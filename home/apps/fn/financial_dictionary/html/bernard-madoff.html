<h1>Bernard Madoff</h1>

<p>The former chairman of the Nasdaq and founder of the market-making firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Madoff, who also ran a hedge fund, was arrested on December 11, 2008, for running an alleged Ponzi scheme; his hedge fund lost about $50 billion, but kept it hidden by paying out earlier investors with money from later investors.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Attorney's criminal complaint against him, Madoff was arrested after telling senior employees at his firm that "it's all just one big lie ... basically, a giant Ponzi scheme."</p>

<p>With consistent returns of 1-1.5% per month for more than 10 years, it was hard for investors not to believe the lines used to sell Madoff's hedge fund. The fund's supposed strategy was to use a proprietary option collar strategy that was meant to minimize volatility. This was provided as the reason for the fund's consistent returns.</p>
