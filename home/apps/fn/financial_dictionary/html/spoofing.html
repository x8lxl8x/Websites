<h1>Spoofing</h1>

<p>A type of deception where an intruder attempts to gain unauthorized access to a user's system or information via pretending to be the user. In email spoofing (or phishing), the user receives an email that appears to be from a legitimate source but actually it is sent by someone else. The main purpose is to trick the user into releasing sensitive information such as passwords, so that the malicious spoofer can continue to pretend to be the user and use his or her accounts.</p>

<p>Any email that claims it requires your password or any personal information could be a trick. To protect yourself from hackers you use can routers and firewalls that block out anything suspicious. Always be cautious when giving away information on the internet and make sure that you only download files from a trusted source.</p>
