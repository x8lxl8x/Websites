<h1>Accounting Event</h1>

<p>A transaction or change recognized on the financial statements of an accounting entity. Accounting events can be either external or internal. An external transaction would occur with an outside party, such as the purchase or sales of a good. An internal transaction would involve changes in the accounting entity's records, such as adjusting an account on the financial statements.</p>

<p>An accounting event is any financial event that would impact the account balances of a company's financial statements. Every time the company uses or receives cash, or adjusts an entry in its accounting records, an accounting event has occurred.</p>
