<h1>Robert J. Aumann</h1>

<p>An economist and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Thomas Schelling, for his analysis of game theory in conflict and cooperation scenarios. Game theory is a type of applied math used in a number of disciplines to understand individuals' strategic behavior and is used to predict the actions of others.</p>

<p>Born in 1930 in Germany, Aumann emigrated to the United States with his family in 1938 to flee the Nazis. He earned a PhD in math from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955 and became an instructor in the math department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1956, where he has remained for decades.</p>
