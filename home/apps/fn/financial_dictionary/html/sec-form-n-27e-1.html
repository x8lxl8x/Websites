<h1>SEC Form N-27E-1</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be used by issuers of periodic payment plans to inform holders of periodic payment plan certificates who have missed certain payments within 18 months of the issuance of the certificate of their surrender rights. SEC Form N-27E-1 tells the holder that he or she has a specified amount of time to surrender the plan certificate and receive, in addition to the value of the account on the date the certificate is received, a refund of that portion of the sales charges he or she has paid in excess of 15% of the gross payments under the plan.</p>

<p>SEC Form N-27E-1 is also known as "Notice to Periodic Payment Plan Certificate Holders of 18 Months Surrender Rights with Respect to Periodic Payment Plan Certificates." This notice must be sent to all purchasers of plan certificates and is meant to help them make fully informed decisions about their investments.</p>
