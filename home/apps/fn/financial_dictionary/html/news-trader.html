<h1>News Trader</h1>

<p>A trader or investor who makes trading or investing decisions based on news announcements. Economic reports and other news can have a short-lived affect on particular markets. News traders try to profit by predicting how a market will respond to particular news. The old saying "buy the rumor, sell the news" means that rumors have one effect on a particular trading instrument's price movement, and news can have an opposite effect.
News traders rely on short-term reactions to news to drive the market in a particular direction. News traders can look at historical data to predict how future news can affect prices. By becoming familiar with certain markets, news traders can make a guess as to whether a stock or other trading instrument will increase or decrease in price following a news report. Often these price moves happen within an extremely short period of time following the news; therefore, news traders must be quick to respond if they hope to capture profits. This also means that news traders must be one of the first to receive breaking news.</p>
