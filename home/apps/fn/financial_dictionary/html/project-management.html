<h1>Project Management</h1>

<p>The planning and organization of an organization's resources in order to move a specific task, event or duty toward completion. Project management typically involves a one-time project rather than an ongoing activity, and resources managed include both human and financial capital.</p>

<p>A project manager will help define the goals and objectives of the project, determine when the various project components are to be completed and by whom, and create quality control checks to ensure that completed components meet a certain standard.</p>

<p>Project management is often closely associated with engineering projects, which typically have a complex set of components that have to be completed and assembled in a set fashion in order to create a functioning product. Project managers use visual representations of workflow, such as Gantt charts and PERT charts, to determine which tasks are to be completed by which departments.</p>
