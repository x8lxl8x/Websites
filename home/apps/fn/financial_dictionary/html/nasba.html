<h1>National Association Of State Boards Of Accountancy - NASBA</h1>

<p>A U.S. nonprofit group founded in 1908 that seeks to enhance the effectiveness of the state boards of accountancy. Public accountancy is regulated at the state level, with each state maintaining an independent board of accountancy that oversees the profession. NASBA assists the 55 state boards of accountancy by providing a forum for greater interaction and collaboration across states.</p>

<p>Since the license to practice accountancy is granted at the state level, a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed in one state has to obtain a new license if he or she moves to a different state. The NASBA has worked toward standardizing the state requirements for licensure so that CPAs will have their qualifications recognized in all states.</p>
