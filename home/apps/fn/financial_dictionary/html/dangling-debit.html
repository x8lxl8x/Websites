<h1>Dangling Debit</h1>

<p>A debit entry with no offsetting credit entry. Dangling debit occurs when a company purchases goodwill or services to create a debit. When adding the journal entry to financial statements a corresponding credit balance is not reported and cannot be written off. Dangling debit can be received when a company is acquired but is not recorded on the balance sheet.</p>

<p>When a company purchases goodwill, the company will receive a debit entry on its financial statements, but no entry is entered on the credit side and therefore a dangling debit is created. When a company uses dangling debit in their financial statements, it is offset by affecting the equity of the company by being listed as deductions or negative reserves.</p>
