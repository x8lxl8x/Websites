<h1>12B-1 Fund</h1>

<p>A type of mutual fund that charges its holders 12B-1 fees instead of up-front or back-end commissions. 12B-1 funds take a portion of assets held and use them to pay expense fees and distribution costs. These costs are included in the fund's expense ratio and are described in the prospectus.</p>

<p>The name 12B-1 comes from the Investment Company Act of 1940's Rule 12B-1, which allows fund companies to act as distributors of their own shares. Rule 12B-1 further states that a mutual fund's own assets can be used to pay distribution charges. Originally, the rule was intended to pay advertising and marketing expenses; today, however, a very small percentage of the fee actually goes toward these costs.</p>
