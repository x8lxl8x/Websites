<h1>Short Term</h1>

<p>1. In general, holding an asset for short period of time.</p>

<p>2. In accounting, an asset expected to be converted into cash in the next year, or a liability coming due in the next year. Also known as current assets and liabilities.</p>

<p>3. For investing, a security that matures in one year or less.</p>

<p>4. For taxes, a holding period of less that one year.</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the exact definition depends on the context. However, in general, you can think of short term as within the next year.</p>

<p>The determination can be very important for taxes. Assets held short-term are generally taxed at a higher rate than assets held for more than a year.</p>
