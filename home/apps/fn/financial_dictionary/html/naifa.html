<h1>National Association Of Insurance And Financial Advisors - NAIFA</h1>

<p>A nonprofit group that works on behalf of its members to promote a favorable regulative environment, provide professional education services and ensure ethical professional conduct for insurance and financial advisors.</p>

<p>The NAIFA also provides its members with sales training, networking facilities and other tools to help them succeed and build their practices. In addition, they lobby on Capitol Hill to promote favorable legislation for the insurance and financial advisory industry.</p>

<p>The NAIFA was originally founded in 1890 as the National Association of Life Underwriters. The organization believes that life insurance and other risk mitigation practices should be at the core of a solid financial plan. NAIFA has many endorsements from large insurance and financial corporations, who encourage their employees to join a local NAIFA chapter.</p>
