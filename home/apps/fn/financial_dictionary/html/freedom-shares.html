<h1>Freedom Shares</h1>

<p>Original issue discount bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury from May of 1967 to October of 1970. Freedom shares had a final maturity of 30 years from their issue date and were originally offered in combination with Series E bonds to promote public investment in government bonds.
Also known as "savings notes".</p>

<p>All remaining freedom shares reached final maturity in October of 2000. Any shares still outstanding should be cashed in. These notes can be redeemed at any Federal Reserve bank and many other savings institutions as well.</p>
