<h1>Gemology</h1>

<p>The combined art and science of studying, cutting, valuing, buying and selling precious stones. Some of the most precious stones that gemologists deal in include diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds.</p>

<p>Gemology is spelled gemmology outside of North America.</p>

<p>With advances in gemstone synthesis, gemology has become a much more important field of study. Gemologists value stones based on a number of factors, including cut, color, quality and clarity. When returns in the stock market decline, aggressive investors often seek out alternative investments that hold more promise of increasing returns on invested capital. Gemstone investing can appeal to people who want to make quick returns, but it is highly speculative and should be left to experienced professionals.</p>
