<h1>Transfer On Death - TOD</h1>

<p>A way of designating beneficiaries to receive your assets at the time of your death without having to go through probate. This designation also allows you to specify the percentage of assets each person or entity (your "TOD beneficiary") will receive. Your assets will then be automatically transferred to the designated beneficiaries upon your death.</p>

<p>Transfer-on-death is a means of transferring assets without the hassle, delay and cost of probate. If you set up your account or have your securities registered this way, the executor or administrator of your estate won't have to take any action to ensure that your securities transfer to the beneficiaries you have designated.</p>

<p>With TOD registration, you maintain complete control of your assets during your lifetime. Your named beneficiaries have no access to or control over your assets as long as you are alive.</p>
