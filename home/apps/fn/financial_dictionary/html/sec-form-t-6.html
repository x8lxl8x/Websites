<h1>SEC Form T-6</h1>

<p>This form must be filed with the SEC to determine whether a foreign person is eligible to act as an institutional trustee. This SEC Form T-6 requires the name and address of the proposed trustee, the company's jurisdiction and address and the name and contact information of the agent for service. Information pertaining to the name and examination of any authorities to which the trustee is subject must also be furnished, as well as any affiliate data.</p>

<p>Form T-6 is required under section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This act required that these forms be completed by any foreign party wishing to distribute bonds in the U.S. These forms allowed the SEC to discern whether the foreign issuer was financially able to guarantee the bonds.</p>
