<h1>Lipper Leader</h1>

<p>A rating system that ranks a mutual fund's success based on whether the fund has met certain goals. Mutual funds are ranked based on total return, consistent return, preservation, tax efficiency or expenses. The top 20% of funds receive the highest ratings and are named Lipper Leaders, based on the Thomson Reuters mutual fund company of the same name (Lipper). Asset managers, fund companies and financial intermediaries recognize Lipper's benchmarking and classifications as an industry standard.</p>

<p>A fund that has received a Lipper rating for total return has proven to return income from dividends, interest and capital appreciation. A rating for expense identifies low cost funds. Consistent return ratings are funds that provide constant returns that are risk-adjusted. A Lipper rating for preservation is for funds that demonstrate a high ability to preserve capital as compared with other funds within the same asset class.</p>
