<h1>Accidental Death And Dismemberment Insurance - AD&D</h1>

<p>A rider attached to a life or health insurance policy. AD&D covers death by accidental means (rather than natural causes) and dismemberment, which includes loss of the use of certain body parts (including limbs or eyesight.)</p>

<p>These riders are usually written in such a way that the insurer must pay double the amount payable otherwise, or a specific amount of continous income payments, and are sometimes called double indemnity riders. AD&D insurance is often offered by employers as an extra option on group health plans.</p>

<p>It is important to carefully check the terms of AD&D policies. For example, if you are injured in an accident that later turns out to be fatal, the death must occur within a certain amount of time. To qualify for 100% of the dismemberment insurance, the injury may have to involve the loss of two limbs or both eyes.</p>

<p>There is a schedule that lays out what percentage of the total will be paid for so-called partial dismemberment, such as the loss of one limb or the sight in one eye. Overall, AD&D is a limited policy that will be useful to a small percentage of people, so be sure to read the fine print in advance so that you understand exactly what is covered, and under what time frames.</p>
