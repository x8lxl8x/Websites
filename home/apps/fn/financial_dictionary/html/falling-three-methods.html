<h1>Falling Three Methods</h1>

<p>A bearish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the continuation of the current downtrend. This pattern is formed when the candlesticks meet the following characteristics:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> The first candle in the pattern is a long red candlestick within a defined downtrend.
<b>2.</b> A series of ascending small-bodied candlesticks that trade within the range of the first candlestick.
<b>3.</b> A long red candlestick creates a new low, which suggests that the sellers are back in control of the direction.</p>

<p>The series of small-bodied candlesticks are regarded as a period of consolidation before the downtrend is able to continue. This pattern is important, because it shows traders that buyers still do not have enough conviction to reverse the trend and it is used by some active traders as a signal to add to their short positions.</p>
