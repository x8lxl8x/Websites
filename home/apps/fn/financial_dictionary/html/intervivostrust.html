<h1>Inter-Vivos Trust</h1>

<p>A fiduciary relationship used in estate planning that is created during the lifetime of the trustor. Also known as a living trust, this trust has a duration that is deemed at the trust's creation and can entail the distribution of assets to the beneficiary during or after the trustor's lifetime. The opposite of an inter-vivos trust is a testamentary trust, which goes into effect upon the death of the trustor.</p>

<p>One important reason for establishing a trust is to avoid probate, a process of distributing the deceased's assets in court. This process can be lengthy, costly and can also expose a family's private financial matters by making them a matter of public record. A properly established trust helps ensure that assets go to their intended recipients in a timely and private matter.</p>
