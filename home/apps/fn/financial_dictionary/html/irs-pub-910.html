<h1>IRS Publication 910 -</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides information to taxpayers about the free resources the agency provides. IRS Publication 910 identifies many of the commonly used resources available, where to find them and how to use them. The IRS provides online tax filing, tax clinics, newsletters and phone services for both individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>In addition to finding tax resources at IRS offices, material can also be found at other institutions such as post offices, libraries and government offices.</p>

<p>The IRS has shifted many of its traditionally print-only resources to an online format, allowing taxpayers access to information in a more convenient manner; however, print and phone resources are still available at certain times during the year.</p>

<p>The IRS provides a DVD with forms, instructions and publications, but this item is not free and has to be ordered.</p>
