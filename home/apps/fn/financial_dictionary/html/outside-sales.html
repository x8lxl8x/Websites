<h1>Outside Sales</h1>

<p>The sale of products or services by sales personnel who go out into the field to meet with potential customers. Salespeople often travel to meet customers face-to-face, as well as to maintain relationships with existing customers. However, some companies may consider telemarketing a form of outside sales as well.</p>

<p>Maintaining an outside sales force can be expensive, since companies typically have to compensate outside sales personnel for miles traveled, housing and food. In some industries, outside sales forces are the norm because customers will not move forward with a purchase solely through inside sales strategies.</p>
