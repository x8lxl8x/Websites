<h1>Stockholm Stock Exchange (STO) .ST</h1>

<p>The main securities market in Sweden, the Stockholm Stock Exchange was founded in 1863. In 1997, it joined the NOREX alliance, a group that also includes the stock exchanges of Oslo, Copenhagen and Iceland, as part of an effort for the Nordic exchanges to attract greater international investment through a common trading platform and streamlined regulations.</p>

<p>In 1998, the Stockholm Stock Exchange merged with OMX. In 2007, it changed its name to OMX Nordic Exchange Stockholm AB. At the time of writing, it is held by the Nordic division of NASDAQ OMX, the world's largest exchange holding company.</p>

<p>The exchange trades in equities, premium bonds, retail bonds, convertible loans, subscription rights, exchange-traded options and warrants. One of its major indexes is the market-value-weighted OMX Stockholm 30, which tracks the 30 most-traded stocks.</p>
