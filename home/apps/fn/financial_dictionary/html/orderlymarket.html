<h1>Orderly Market</h1>

<p>Any market in which the supply and demand are reasonably equal. The orderly market would thus be said to be in a state of equilibrium.</p>

<p>This can also refer to a site of exchange for goods, services or financial securities that is run in a fair, reliable, secure, accurate and efficient way. Orderly markets contribute to economic growth.</p>

<p>Orderly markets usually have stable and competitive prices, reflecting the true value of the good or service. For securities markets, a stock exchange's market surveillance team is the entity in charge of ensuring an orderly market. In a disorderly market, there may be market manipulation, insider trading and other violations of regulations. If a market is disorderly, investors may lack the confidence to participate. The Federal Reserve also attempts to promote orderly market functioning by ensuring market liquidity.</p>
