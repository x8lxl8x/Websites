<h1>Small Business Development Center - SBDC</h1>

<p>A partnership between the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and typically a local college or university designed to help foster small businesses by providing educational resources to business owners and those looking to start a business. Small Business Development Centers provide free marketing, financing and business-related activities to local entrepreneurs. They are found in all states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and U.S. territories.</p>

<p>SBDCs combine private-sector know-how with the educational background of colleges and universities in order to provide entrepreneurs with the resources they need to feel confident in starting a business. Less than half of a SBDC's funding comes from the SBA, with the remaining portion coming from state funding, donations, grants and corporate sponsorships.</p>
