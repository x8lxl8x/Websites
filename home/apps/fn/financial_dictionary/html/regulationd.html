<h1>Regulation D - Reg D</h1>

<p>A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation governing private placement exemptions. Reg D allows usually smaller companies to raise capital through the sale of equity or debt securities without having to register their securities with the SEC.</p>

<p>Reg D offerings are advantageous to any private company or entrepreneur because they allow an entity to obtain funding faster and to avoid the costs associated with a public offering.</p>

<p>Even if the transaction only involves one or two investors, the company or entrepreneur wanting to raise capital still needs to provide the proper framework and disclosure documentation; however, these requirements are significantly less than what is required for a public offering.</p>
