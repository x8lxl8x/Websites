<h1>Adventure Capitalist</h1>

<p>1. Another word for "venture capitalist", or someone who invests in start-up companies.</p>

<p>2. A specific type of venture capitalist who is more accessible, but who may be harder to find and whose pockets are not as deep as a traditional venture capitalist. Or, a specific type of venture capitalist who is willing to invest in endeavors that would be considered too risky for traditional venture capitalists.</p>

<p>3. A wealthy individual who seeks out exciting experiences.</p>

<p>4. The title of a book in which author and former Wall Street financier Jim Rogers describes his three-year, 116-country road trip. Rogers retired at age 37, and has also toured the world by motorcycle, setting Guinness Book records for both trips.</p>

<p>Adventure capitalists invest in smaller upstarts when they are young and in need of funding to expand their operations. They may specialize in investing in particular industries, in which they have specialized knowledge. Adventure capitalists also take on a great deal of risk, but often have a say in company decision making and can earn large returns on their investments if the company succeeds.</p>
