<h1>SEC Form F-3</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for the registration of certain securities by foreign issuers. SEC Form F-3 is used by certain foreign private issuers that have a global market capitalization greater than $75 million and that have reported under the 1934 Act for a minimum of 1 year. It is also used by eligible foreign private issuers to register offerings of non-convertible investment-grade securities.</p>

<p>Form F-3 is also known as the Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933.</p>

<p>This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. Form F-3 helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
