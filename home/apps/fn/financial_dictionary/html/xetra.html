<h1>Xetra</h1>

<p>An all-electronic trading system based in Frankfurt, Germany. Launched in 1997 and operated by the Deutsche BÃ¶rse, the Xetra platform offers increased flexibility for seeing order depth within the markets and offers trading in stocks, funds, bonds, warrants and commodities contracts.</p>

<p>The Xetra system was originally created for use on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, but has expanded to be used by various stock exchanges throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Xetra was one of the first global electronic trade systems, and has grown to account for more than 90% of all stock trades on the Frankfurt Exchange. In addition to opening up the German markets for increased foreign investment, it is currently being used by stock exchanges in Ireland, Vienna and Shanghai.</p>
