<h1>SEC Form S-4EF</h1>

<p>An SEC filing that is required when forming a savings bank, savings and loan or similar financial institution that issues securities as a result of the investment of its customers' deposits. Savings banks and similar financial institutions are required to file Form S-4EF under SEC General Instruction G and Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<p>The 1934 Act was created to help investors make informed decisions by requiring companies which have more than $10 million in assets, with 500 or more equity holders and who issue securities on a national securities exchange, to complete and file registration statements (including financial and material information) with the SEC before making an issue available for purchase by the public. Companies must keep these filings regularly updated for investors by submitting completed 10-Q, 10K and/or 8-K forms with the SEC.</p>
