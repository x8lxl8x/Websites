<h1>Cash Flow from Financing Activities</h1>

<p>A category in the cash flow statement that accounts for external activities such as issuing cash dividends, adding or changing loans, or issuing and selling more stock. The formula for cash flow from financing activities is as follows:</p>

<p>Cash Received from Issuing Stock or Debt - Cash Paid as Dividends and for Re-Acquisition of Debt/Stock</p>

<p>This section of the statement of cash flows measures the flow of cash between a firm and its owners and creditors. Negative numbers can mean the company is servicing debt, but it can also mean the company is making dividend payments and stock repurchases, which investors might be glad to see.</p>
