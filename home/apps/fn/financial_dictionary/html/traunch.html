<h1>Traunch</h1>

<p>One of a series of fund allotments earmarked for a specific purpose, such as a financing round in a start-up. Traunches are used by venture capital firms as a means of minimizing risk. Some experts believe "traunch" is a misspelling of "tranche", which means a slice or portion, and is used to describe instruments such as mortgage-backed securities that can be sliced into smaller pieces for sale to investors.</p>

<p>For example, a development-stage company that has sought venture capital funding may initially receive a $2 million traunch out of a $5 million financing round, with the balance to be received after a month.</p>
