<h1>Bank Statement</h1>

<p>A record, usually sent to the account holder once per month, summarizing all transactions in an account during the time from the previous statement to the current statement. The opening balance from the prior month combined with the net of all transactions during the period should result in the closing balance for the current statement.</p>

<p>Consumers should carefully review their bank statements and retain them for their own records. In reconciling their own record of transactions with the bank's records, account holders should be on the lookout for incorrect or transposed numbers as well as unauthorized transactions. Discrepancies should be reported as soon as possible, in writing if possible.</p>
