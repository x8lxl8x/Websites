<h1>Extension Risk</h1>

<p>The risk of a security's expected maturity lengthening in duration due to the deceleration of prepayments. Extension risk is mainly the result of rising interest rates, and is generally associated with mortgage-related securities. The opposite of extension risk is prepayment risk, which generally occurs in a declining interest rate environment, and is associated with people paying off their loans too quickly.</p>

<p>As interest rates rise, the likelihood of prepayment decreases as people will be less likely to refinance their homes. If the loans in a pool underlying a mortgage-related security are being prepaid at a slower rate, investors are unable to capitalize on higher interest rates because their investments are locked in at a lower rate for a longer period of time. As interest rates decline, however, the likelihood of prepayment increases because refinancing becomes more attractive. When a loan is refinanced, the original loan gets paid off, and investors then have to invest their proceeds at the new, lower market rate.</p>
