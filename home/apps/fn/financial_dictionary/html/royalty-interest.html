<h1>Royalty Interest</h1>

<p>In the oil and gas industry this refers to ownership of a portion of the resource or revenue that is produced. A company or person that owns a royalty interest does not bear any of the costs of the operations needed to produce the resource, yet the person or company still owns a portion of resource of revenue produced.</p>

<p>In contrast to a royalty interest, a working interest refers to an investment in an oil and gas operation where the investor does bear some of the costs for exploration, drilling and production. An investor that has a royalty interest only bears the cost of the initial investment and isn't liable for ongoing operating costs.</p>
