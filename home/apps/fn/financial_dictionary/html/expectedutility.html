<h1>Expected Utility</h1>

<p>An economic term summarizing the utility that an entity or aggregate economy is expected to reach under any number of circumstances. The expected utility is calculated by taking the weighted average of all possible outcomes under certain circumstances, with the weights being assigned by the likelihood, or probability, that any particular event will occur.</p>

<p>The expected utility of an entity is derived from the expected utility hypothesis. This hypothesis states that under uncertainty, the weighted average of all possible levels of utility will best represent the utility at any given point in time.</p>
