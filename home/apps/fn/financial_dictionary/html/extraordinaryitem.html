<h1>Extraordinary Item</h1>

<p>Gains or losses included in a company's financial statements, which are infrequent and unusual in nature. These are usually explained further in the "notes to the financial statements."</p>

<p>These are the result of unforeseen and atypical events. They are usually accounted for separately so they don't skew the company's regular earnings.</p>

<p>An example would be a snowstorm in Hawaii creating extraordinary losses to banana crops. These losses might be written down as a one-time charge due to an extraordinary item.</p>
