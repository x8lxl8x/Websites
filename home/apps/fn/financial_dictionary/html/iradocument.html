<h1>IRA Adoption Agreement And Plan Document</h1>

<p>A contract between the owner of an individual retirement account and the financial institution where the account is held. The IRA adoption agreement and plan document must be signed by the account owner before the IRA can be valid. It contains basic personal information about the account holder (such as address, date of birth and Social Security number) and lays out the detailed rules regarding the retirement account.</p>

<p>The IRA adoption agreement and plan document explains the plan's annual contribution limits, how contributions may be invested, the types of investments that are prohibited (e.g., collectibles), how and when the account funds may be withdrawn, provisions regarding required distributions, under what conditions the account may be transferred, what will happen to the account if the owner (depositor) dies, and what fees and expenses are associated with the plan.</p>
