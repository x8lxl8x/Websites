<h1>IMF Nonfuel Commodity Index</h1>

<p>An index of  nonfuel commodities developed and maintained by the International Monetary Fund. The index defines nonfuel commodities as industrial metals, food, beverages and agricultural raw materials, along with certain energy sources such as coal. It excludes precious metals such as gold</p>

<p>Weights of the nonfuel commodities in the index use 2005 as the base year. Many developing nations are very dependent on nonfuel commodities for export earnings and monitor the IMF Nonfuel Commodity Index for market trends. Prices of some nonfuel commodities such as metals have occasionally increased faster than oil  prices.</p>
