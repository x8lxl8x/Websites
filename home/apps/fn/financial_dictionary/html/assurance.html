<h1>Assurance</h1>

<p>Coverage of an event that is certain to happen. Assurance is similar to insurance (and sometimes the terms are interchangeable) except that insurance protects policyholders from events that might happen.
For example, a person can choose to purchase life assurance or term life insurance. (Note in the U.K. "life assurance" is another term for "life insurance".) The event in question is the death of the person the policy covers. Since the death of this person is certain, a life assurance policy results in payment to the beneficiary when the policyholder dies. A term life insurance policy, however, will cover a set period of time, such as 30 years, from the time the policy was bought. If the policyholder dies during that time, the beneficiary receives money, but if the policyholder dies after the 30 years, no money is received. The assurance policy covers an event that will happen no matter what, while the insurance policy covers a event that might happen (the policyholder might die within the next 30 years).           </p>
