<h1>Business Liability Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance that protects a company and/or business owner in the event of a formal lawsuit or other third-party claim. Coverage includes any financial liability incurred in addition to expenses related to the company's legal defense. There are three main types of business liability insurance:  general liability insurance, professional liability insurance and product liability insurance.</p>

<p>If you are a small business owner, your form of ownership - especially a partnership or sole proprietorship - could put your personal finances at risk in the event of a business-related lawsuit.  Even under a limited liability corporation (LLC) you could still be exposed to personal risk. Business liability insurance can provide you with greater insurance protection than is offered by your legal structure.</p>

<p>New or additional insurance policies should contain an exclusions clause to minimize cost by avoiding duplications of coverage provided in other policies and/or to eliminate any unneeded coverage.</p>
