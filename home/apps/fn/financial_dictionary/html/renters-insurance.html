<h1>Renter's Insurance</h1>

<p>A form of property insurance that provides coverage for a policy holder's belongings and liability within a rental property. Renter's insurance applies to persons renting or subletting a single family home, apartment, duplex, condo, studio, loft or townhome. The policy protects against losses to the tenant's personal property within the rented property. In addition, a renter's insurance policy protects against losses resulting from liability claims, such as injuries occurring on the premises that are not due to a structural problem with the property (in this case, the owner's - not renter's - policy would apply).</p>

<p>Increasingly, proof of renter's insurance is required by many landlords. Personal belongings within a rented property are typically not covered under the owner's or landlord's property insurance. For example, if a flood or fire destroys all the personal property within a rented apartment, the structure would be covered under the landlord's policy, but the personal property would only be covered through a renter's insurance policy. Without this coverage, the tenant would be responsible for the loss out-of-pocket.</p>
