<h1>Missent Item</h1>

<p>Quite simply, a check written by a bank customer that is not sent to the right bank. This is typically due to a clerical error by an employee of the bank or depository institution. Missent items result in a delay of payment from the sending bank to the receiving bank.</p>

<p>Missent items can also result in inconvenience to the customer from the delay in posting to the account. Customers who think that their check has cleared may make other purchases in the account, which can result in overdrawal. Therefore every effort is made to prevent this type of error from occurring.</p>
