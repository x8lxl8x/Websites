<h1>Provincial Parental Insurance Plan - PPIP</h1>

<p>A Canadian tax deduction relating to taxes that are paid or payable on regular or self-employed income. The Provincial Parental Insurance Plan (PPIP) gives maternity, paternity, parental and adoption benefits to qualified persons. This aid is to support and encourage parents staying home with their children for the first year of the child's life.</p>

<p>The province of Quebec has a different plan called the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP). The plan is in place for the same reasons, but has differing rules, regulations and tax implications.</p>
