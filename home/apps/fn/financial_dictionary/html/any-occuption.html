<h1>Any-Occupation Policy</h1>

<p>A term used in the insurance industry to refer to a specific definition of disability when writing disability insurance policies. If you get into an accident that restricts you from working, you would be considered disabled, but disability insurance policies have specific definitions in order to qualify for the benefits. The "any occupation" definition is the stricter definition of disability, where you are unable to work in a job that is reasonably suitable for you based on such things as education, experience and age.</p>

<p>The other common definition of disability is the "own occupation" classification. This definition considers you disabled if you are unable to perform the same job that you worked prior to the accident. For example, if you were a surgeon and you injured your hands, you would be considered disabled under the "own occupation" definition.</p>
