<h1>Home Banking</h1>

<p>The practice of conducting banking transactions from home rather than at branch locations. Home banking generally refers to either banking over the telephone or on the internet. The first experiments with internet banking started in the early 1980s, but it did not become popular until the mid 1990s when home internet access was widespread. Today, a variety of internet banks exist which maintain few, if any, physical branches.</p>

<p>The increasing popularity of home banking has fundamentally changed the character of the banking industry. Many people are able to arrange their affairs so that they seldom have need of a physical branch. Online-only banks have profited from this shift in the industry. The absence of brick and mortar locations allows online banks to offer favorable interest rates, lower fees and many other incentives for those willing to bank online.</p>
