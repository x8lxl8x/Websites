<h1>Secondary Reserves</h1>

<p>Assets that are invested in safe, marketable, short-term securities such as Treasury bills when the demand for loans is low. Secondary reserves provide a supplemental measure of low-risk liquidity. They earn interest and can be useful in adjusting a bank's reserve totals.</p>

<p>Secondary reserves are often deposited in short-term instruments that can quickly be converted to cash when additional liquidity is required. However, they are not listed separately on the balance sheet.</p>

<p>Secondary reserves differ from legal reserves in their ability to earn interest.</p>
