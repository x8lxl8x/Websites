<h1>Division Of Corporate Finance</h1>

<p>The Division of Corporate Finance is a branch of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The division is responsible for ensuring that publicly-traded firms provide the required level of disclosure of material information to investors. The division reviews all required documents issued to investors, including 10-K forms, 10-Q forms, proxy materials and annual reports.</p>

<p>It is important that investors receive the full picture regarding a company's financial picture and business conditions. Without proper disclosure, it would be difficult or impossible for investors to judge the value of publicly-traded firms in order to make buy or sell decisions. Thus, the disclosures overseen by the Division of Corporate Finance are central to the efficient functioning of the financial markets.</p>
