<h1>Fringe Benefits</h1>

<p>A collection of various benefits provided by an employer, which are exempt from taxation as long as certain conditions are met.

<p>Fringe benefits commonly include health insurance, group term life coverage, education reimbursement, childcare and assistance reimbursement, cafeteria plans, employee discounts, personal use of a company owned vehicle and other similar benefits.</p>
