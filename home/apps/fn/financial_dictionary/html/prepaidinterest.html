<h1>Prepaid Interest</h1>

<p>The interest that a debtor pays before the first scheduled debt repayment. For taxation purposes, most kinds of prepaid interest are expensed over the life of the loan.</p>

<p>For mortgage loans, prepaid interest can also be the interim interest that accrues from the settlement day to the beginning of the first mortgage period.
Points, a kind of fee that mortgage lenders charge borrowers, are considered a type of prepaid interest. Similar to other types of prepaid interest, points are typically deducted over the life of the loan (in this case, a mortgage). However, provided that certain conditions are met, the IRS does allow this type of prepaid interest to be deducted in the year in which it is paid.           </p>
