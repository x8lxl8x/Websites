<h1>McKinsey 7S Model</h1>

<p>A model of organizational effectiveness that postulates that there are seven internal factors of an organization that need to be aligned and reinforced in order for it to be successful. The 7S Model was developed at McKinsey & Co. consulting firm in the early 1980s by consultants Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, authors of the management bestseller "In Search of Excellence."</p>

<p>The 7S Model specifies seven factors that are classified into "hard" and "soft" elements. Hard elements are easily identified and influenced by management, while soft elements are fuzzier, more intangible and are influenced by the corporate culture. The hard elements are: strategy, structure and systems. The soft elements are: shared values, skills, style and staff.</p>
