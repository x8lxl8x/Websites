<h1>Derivatives Transaction Execution Facility - DTEF</h1>

<p>A market that supports the transaction of derivatives on which the underlying commodities are limited to excluded commodities or assets with an inexhaustible, deliverable supply. A derivatives transaction execution facility allows for the transaction of commodities with no cash market; however, all products listed on the exchange must not be susceptible to manipulation. DTEFs must be registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which grants them fewer regulatory requirements than other contract markets.</p>

<p>Derivatives transaction execution facilities are not open to retail investors. To trade on this exchange, an investor must belong to an eligible commercial entity, be an eligible contract participant or transact through a futures commission merchant. DTEFs provide a venue for the trading of excluded commodities, such as interest or exchange rates and other derivatives.</p>
