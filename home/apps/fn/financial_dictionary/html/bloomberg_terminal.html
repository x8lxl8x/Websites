<h1>Bloomberg Terminal</h1>

<p>A computer system that allows investors to access the Bloomberg data service, which provides real-time financial data, news feeds, messages and also facilitates the placement of trades. Bloomberg charges a monthly fee, typically in the range of thousands of dollars per workstation for access to its system.</p>

<p>Bloomberg terminals are one of the main product offerings from Bloomberg L.P. and it is one of the most heavily used and highly regarded professional investment systems to be created for the financial marketplace. Institutional investors are the typical customers of this product, since the relatively high ongoing cost makes it unfeasible for individual investors with relatively small amounts of capital to purchase.</p>
