<h1>Sponsored ADR</h1>

<p>An American depositary receipt (ADR) that is issued in co-operation with the underlying foreign company whose equity shares will underly the ADR shares. With the corporation's sponsorship, the ADRs created in the issue usually afford their owners the same rights normally given to stockholders, such as voting rights.</p>

<p>For an ADR issue to become listed and trade on a major U.S. exchange, it must be sponsored by the underlying corporation. If not, the ADR issue is likely to be traded over the counter.</p>
