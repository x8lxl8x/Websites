<h1>SEC Form 18</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), more commonly known as the Application for Registration of Foreign Governments and Political Subdivisions. It is mandated for foreign governments wishing to issue a new security for sale in the U.S. The standard information required from a foreign issuer on SEC Form 18 includes the branch of government issuing the security, the type of security, and the amount to be issued.</p>

<p>SEC Form 18 is useful to investors trying to research a foreign security that is available on U.S. investment markets. By analyzing SEC Form 18, an investor can gain a better understanding of which department of a foreign government is issuing the security, as well as the key details for that security (maturity date, interest or dividend rate, size of the issue, etc).</p>
