<h1>Clandestine Takeover</h1>

<p>An attempt to gain control over a company through secretive means. Clandestine takeover attempts are often launched against publicly-traded companies where individuals can acquire shares on the secondary market without disclosing their activities. This may be advantageous in situations where existing management would be hostile to a conventional takeover bid.</p>

<p>Ownership disclosure laws differ from country to country. In the United States, one is normally required to disclose ownership positions of more than 5%. Depending on the disclosure rules in force in a particular jurisdiction, there may be means available to gain effective control of even larger ownership stakes without triggering disclosure requirements.</p>
