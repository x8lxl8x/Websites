<h1>Green Marketing</h1>

<p>Marketing products and services based on environmental factors or awareness. Companies involved in green marketing make decisions relating to the entire process of the company's products, such as methods of processing, packaging and distribution.</p>

<p>Green marketing companies seek to go above and beyond traditional marketing by promoting environmental core values in the hope that consumers will associate these values with their company or brand. Engaging in these sustainable activities can lead to creating a new product line that caters to a new target market.</p>

<p>Also known as sustainable marketing, environmental marketing or ecological marketing.</p>
