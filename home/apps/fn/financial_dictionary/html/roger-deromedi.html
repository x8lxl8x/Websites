<h1>Roger Deromedi</h1>

<p>A former CEO of Kraft Foods. Deromedi joined Kraft in 1988 as vice president of corporate development. After working his way up through the company and leading and expanding the company's international divisions, he became president and co-CEO (along with Betsy Holden) in 2001. The pair helped the company go public. As Kraft lost market share amidst Americans' concerns about nutrition, Holden was demoted in 2003, making Deromedi the only CEO until his sudden replacement in 2006.</p>

<p>Born in California in 1953, Deromedi earned his M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and began his career with General Foods in 1977. He has also served as chairman of Pinnacle Foods, a dry and frozen packaged foods company.</p>
