<h1>Adminispam</h1>

<p>A slang term describing electronic messages from a company's executives that are of little value to the employee who has received it because it pertains to personnel that the employee is not involved with or projects that the employee does not work on. Adminispam is formed by the combination of the words "administration" and "spam," with the latter referring to unwanted communication.</p>

<p>Adminispam messages highlight a disconnect between an administration's goal of remaining important in the eyes of the general employees and providing poignant messages that communicate necessary information. By sending a message to all employees that should have been sent to a small few, administrators clog up inboxes and can create a scenario in which future, and possibly important, emails from administrators are automatically disregarded.</p>
