<h1>Small Business Lending Index - SLBI</h1>

<p>An index of business lending that is published by Thomson Reuters/Paynet. The Small Business Lending Index (SLBI) is generally considered to be a leading indicator of the economy. It measures the number of loans that are made to small businesses, using 2005 as the base year for computations.</p>

<p>The Small Business Lending Index correlates most closely with the GDP, as it leads as an indicator by an average of two to five months. The index is generated from loan origination information supplied by over 200 U.S. lenders. This data is then collected by Paynet and used to create the index. Historically, the SBLI encompasses nearly $750 billion in loans.</p>
