<h1>Suggestive Selling</h1>

<p>A sales technique where the employee asks the customer if they would like to include an additional purchase or recommends a product which might suit the client. Suggestive selling is used to increase the purchase amount of the client and revenues of the business. Often times the additional sale is much smaller than the original purchase and is a complimentary product.</p>

<p>The idea behind the technique is that it takes marginal effort compared the potential additional revenue. This is because getting the buyer to purchase (often seen as the most difficult part) has already been done. After the buyer is committed, an additional sale which is a fraction of the original purchase is much more likely.</p>

<p>Also known as add on selling or upselling.</p>
