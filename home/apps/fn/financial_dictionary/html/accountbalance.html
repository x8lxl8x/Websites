<h1>Account Balance</h1>

<p>1. The amount of money in a financial repository, such as a checking account, at any given moment.
2. The total amount of money owed to a third party such as a credit card company, utility company, mortgage banker or other type of lender or creditor.</p>

<p>The account balance will always be the net amount after factoring in all debits and credits.</p>

<p>For example, on a credit card account, you may have made purchases of $100, $50 and $25 and returned an item costing $10. The account balance would include not just the purchases you made, which total $175, but also the item you returned for $10. The net of your debits and credits would be $165 ($175 - $10), and that amount would be your account balance.</p>
