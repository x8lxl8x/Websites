<h1>Extended Trading</h1>

<p>Trading conducted on electronic exchanges either after regular trading hours are over or before they begin. Usually such trading is limited in its volume compared to regular trading hours. Pre-market trading in the U.S. markets usually runs between 8am and 9:30am EST, and after-market trading typically runs from 4pm until 6:30pm EST.</p>

<p>Extended trading volumes have risen markedly over the past decade as more investors become comfortable with the technology platforms and financial markets become increasingly global.</p>

<p>The rise of electronic communications networks (ECN) have democratized extended-hours trading, allowing even small retail investors the chance to place trades during periods of time once reserved for large institutional investors.</p>
