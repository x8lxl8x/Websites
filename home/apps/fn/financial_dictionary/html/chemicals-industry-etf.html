<h1>Chemicals Industry ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that invests in manufacturers of chemicals. As of 2010, there are no pure-play chemical industry ETFs, but basic materials and agriculture ETFs may be suitable proxies for them, since the chemical sector usually accounts for more than 50% of their investments.</p>

<p>The chemicals sector includes a broad range of companies, including manufacturers and distributors of paint, industrial gases and agricultural products such as potash. Chemical industry components of basic materials ETFs would typically include companies such as Du Pont and Dow Chemical. In agriculture ETFs, the chemical sector is represented by companies such as Monsanto.</p>
