<h1>Additional Death Benefit</h1>

<p>An amount that is paid to the beneficiary of a life insurance contract that is separate from the original death benefit. The additional death benefit acts as an extra layer of payment in the event that a predefined situation occurs.</p>

<p>For example, let's assume that you have a life insurance policy worth $1 million. It is possible for the policy to pay an extra $1 million to your beneficiary in the event that you die within a certain age range.</p>

<p>There are many situations that will trigger an additional death benefit, so you may want to talk with your insurance company to see if there is a policy that is right for you.</p>
