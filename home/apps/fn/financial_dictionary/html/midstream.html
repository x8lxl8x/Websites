<h1>Midstream</h1>

<p>Term used to describe one of the three major stages of oil and gas industry operations. Midstream activities include the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.</p>

<p>Midstream activities are commonly included as part of downstream operations for much of the oil and gas industry. The midstream and downstream activities take place after the initial production phase and through to the point of sale.</p>

<p>Many oil and gas companies are considered integrated because of their ability to combine upstream, midstream and downstream activities as part of their overall operations.</p>
