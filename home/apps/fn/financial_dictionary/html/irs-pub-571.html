<h1>IRS Publication 571: Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans) For Employees of Public Schools And Certain Tax-Exempt Organizations</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides tax information for filers who have a 403(b) retirement plan. IRS Publication 571 indicates who can contribute to a 403(b) plan, the maximum contribution that can be made to a 403(b) plan during the year, rules regarding excess contributions, and the rules regarding rollovers or distributions.</p>

<p>Contributions for a 403(b) plan are generally reported in an employee's W-2 by the employer, and do not need to be reported by the individual employee to the IRS.</p>

<p>While IRS Publication 571 does provide some information on rollovers and distributions of 403(b) accounts, it does not get into specific details. Specifics for rollovers can be found in IRS Publication 590, and information on distributions in Publication 575.</p>
