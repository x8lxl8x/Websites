<h1>Earmarking</h1>

<p>Funds (or capital) that are set aside to pay for a specific project or event. In some cases, the term is also synonymous with the word "flagged", or "marked", especially when used in certain congressional settings.</p>

<p>Major financial institutions, as well as state or federal governments, will often earmark funds received from bond issuances to pay for certain projects. For example, a state may issue municipal bonds, and then earmark the funds received from the bonds' sales to pay for a project such as a new road or bridge.</p>

<p>When used in a congressional setting, the term is often used to refer to specific legislation. For example, a bill might be earmarked for a vote. It may also be earmarked for a presidential veto.</p>
