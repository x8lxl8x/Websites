<h1>Overnight Trading</h1>

<p>The buying or selling of currencies between 9pm and 8am local time. This type of transaction occurs when an investor takes a position at the end of the trading day in a foreign market that will be open while the local market is closed. The trade will be executed sometime that evening or early morning.</p>

<p>For example, the forex market trades 24 hours a day in exchanges around the world. The overlap of trading hours between North American, Australia, Asia and European currency exchanges makes this possible. However, investors must be aware of the significant level of  risk involved with trading overnight, which includes foreign-exchange risk and overnight delivery risk.</p>
