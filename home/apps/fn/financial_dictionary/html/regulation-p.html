<h1>Regulation P</h1>

<p>One of the regulations set forth by the Federal Reserve. Regulation P addresses standards for all bank hardware and equipment related to security and the holding of cash. This regulation covers security measures, such as bank vaults, and other currency-handling equipment, such as ATMs.</p>

<p>Regulation P requires all member banks to have on payroll a head of security that oversees all security precautions. These precautions can include the employment of security guards and alarm systems, as well as routines and procedures designed to prevent theft or robbery. A compliance statement detailing these proceedings must be filed annually.</p>
