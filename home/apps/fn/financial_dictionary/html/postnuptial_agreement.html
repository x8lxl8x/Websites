<h1>Postnuptial Agreement</h1>

<p>A contract created by spouses after entering into marriage that outlines the ownership of financial assets in the event of a divorce. The contract can also set out the responsibilities surrounding any children or other obligations for the duration of the marriage.</p>

<p>Also known as a "post-marital agreement" or "postnup".</p>

<p>Similar to a prenuptial agreement, postnuptial agreements allow a couple to alleviate tension caused by financial concerns. Entering into this style of contract will allow spouses to establish an equitable distribution of assets if the marriage dissolves.</p>

<p>Marital agreements, including postnuptial ones, are often considered taboo. Critics argue such contracts indicate the couple expects the marriage to fail. However, if a contract can remedy financial discomfort, the couple could choose to enter into an agreement in hopes of keeping marital harmony.</p>
