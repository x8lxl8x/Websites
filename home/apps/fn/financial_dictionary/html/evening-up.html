<h1>Evening Up</h1>

<p>A slang phrase used to describe an investor who closes a position by making an offsetting transaction. An investor will eliminate his or her exposure to a security's risk by evening up.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "even up."</p>

<p>Evening up in the equity market involves selling a stock that one currently holds, or buying to cover a short position. In the context of futures, one would even up by entering an opposite position in the contract.</p>

<p>An investor could tell his or her broker to "even up" a current position. Alternatively, one could say "I avoided the price drop by evening up early."</p>
