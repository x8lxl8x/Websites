<h1>Graduate Record Examination - GRE</h1>

<p>A standardized exam used to measure one's aptitude for abstract thinking in the areas of analytical writing, mathematics and vocabulary. The GRE is commonly used by many graduate schools to determine an applicant's eligibility for the program. The GRE is only offered via computer, however in areas which lack the appropriate computer networks, a paper-based exam may be given.</p>

<p>Although the majority of business schools prefer that applicants attempt the GMAT before applying for an MBA program, many business schools will also accept GRE scores as an equivalent. The exam consists of four sections: writing, verbal, quantitative and experimental. The GRE measures a test taker's skills in vocabulary, as opposed to the GMAT, which focuses more on mathematical ability.</p>
