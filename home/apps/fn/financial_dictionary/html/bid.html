<h1>Bid</h1>

<p>1. An offer made by an investor, a trader or a dealer to buy a security. The bid will stipulate both the price at which the buyer is willing to purchase the security and the quantity to be purchased.</p>

<p>2. The price at which a market maker is willing to buy a security. The market maker will also display an ask price, or the amount and price at which it is willing to sell.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of the ask, which stipulates the price a seller is willing to accept for a security and the quantity of the security to be sold at that price.</p>

<p>1. An example of a bid in the market would be $23.53 x 1,000, which means that an investor is willing to purchase 1,000 shares at the price of $23.53. If a seller in the market is willing to sell that amount for that price, then the transaction is completed.</p>

<p>2. Market makers are vital to the efficiency and liquidity of the marketplace. By quoting both bid and ask prices on the market, they always allow investors to buy or sell a security if they need to.</p>
