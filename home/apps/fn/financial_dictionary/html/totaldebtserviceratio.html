<h1>Total Debt Service Ratio - TDS</h1>

<p>A debt service measure that financial lenders use as a rule of thumb to give a preliminary assessment of whether a potential borrower is already in too much debt. More specifically, this ratio shows the proportion of gross income that is already spent on housing-related and other similar payments.</p>

<p>Receiving a ratio of less than 40% means that the potential borrower has an acceptable level of debt.</p>

<p>For example, Jack and Jill, two law students, have a monthly mortgage payment of $1,000 (annual payment of $12,000), property taxes of $3,000, credit card balances totaling $1,000 and a gross family income of $45,000. This would give a TDS of around 36%. Based on the benchmark of 40%, Jack and Jill appear to be carrying an acceptable amount of debt.</p>

<p>This ratio is very similar to the gross debt service ratio (GDS) except that the GDS does not account for non-housing related payments. TDS allows for a slightly more detailed view of a potential borrower's financial situation.</p>
