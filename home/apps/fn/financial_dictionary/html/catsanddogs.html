<h1>Cats And Dogs</h1>

<p>A slang term referring to speculative stocks that have short or suspicious histories for sales, earnings, dividends, etc. The origin for this term may have stemmed from the use of "dog" to refer to an underperforming stock.</p>

<p>In a bull market, analysts will often mention that everything is going up, even the cats and dogs. Therefore, during this time, new investors should not to be too overconfident in their stock picking ability, because even picking the most flawed investment could yield good returns - at least at first.</p>
