<h1>Slow Loan</h1>

<p>A loan that a lender considers at risk for nonpayment. Banks and lending institutions will often set aside a portion of their cash reserves to hedge against potential slow-loan losses. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) originally provided a regulatory definition of a slow loan.</p>

<p>Outstanding delinquent loans must be reported to federal authorities and will be further processed through collection agencies. According to the OTS, delinquent loans are considered "slow" if a one-year loan is more than 60 days overdue or if a loan of up to seven years is over 90 days overdue.</p>
