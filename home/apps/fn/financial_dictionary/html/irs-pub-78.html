<h1>IRS Publication 78</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that lists organizations that qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions, as described in Section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Individuals can claim deductions of both cash and noncash items made to qualified organizations, with typical deductions not exceeding 50% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>

<p>The IRS offers an online version of IRS Publication 78 on its website, which allows taxpayers to quickly check to see if a charitable organization qualifies for tax-deductible contributions. The list is not all-inclusive and might not show every qualifying organization, so an individual tax filer should check to see if an organization has a ruling or determination letter indicating that contributions to it are considered deductible.</p>

<p>IRS Publication 78 should be viewed in conjunction with IRS Publication 561 and IRS Publication 526.</p>
