<h1>Everest Option</h1>

<p>A type of exotic equity option belonging to a class known as mountain range options. The value of an Everest option is based on a basket of underlying securities, as opposed to the typical listed option which has just one underlying asset.</p>

<p>Everest options are in effect for very long time periods - up to 10 years or more - and the payoff of the option is based on the aggregate performance of the worst-performing stock over the full time period.</p>

<p>Everest options are created by - and for - large institutional investors, like hedge funds and investment banks. These very intricate options may contain between 15 and 25 stocks, which can make them difficult to fairly value.</p>

<p>An investor could be devastated by one bad stock among a group of otherwise great performers over the life of an Everest option. If 14 out of 15 stocks were to quadruple in value but the remaining stock dropped 10% over the full period, the option would only recognize the performance of the latter in its payout!</p>
