<h1>Elinor Ostrom</h1>

<p>A political scientist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2009, along with Oliver Williamson, and was the first woman to earn this distinction. Her award-winning research analyzes economic governance, with a focus on the commons. She has published several books, including <i>Governing the Commons</i> (1990); <i>Understanding Institutional Diversity</i> (2005) and <i>Working Together: Collective Action, the Commons, and Multiple Methods in Practice</i> (2010).</p>

<p>Conventional economic wisdom says that property that is communally owned tends to be mismanaged, a phenomenon known as the "tragedy of the commons". One aspect of Ostrom's studies of user-managed fish stocks, pastures, woods, lakes and groundwater basins show that common property is often managed better than we would expect it to be.</p>
