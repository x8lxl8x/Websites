<h1>Power Of Sale</h1>

<p>A clause written into a mortgage authorizing the mortgagee (lender) to sell the property in the event of default, in order to repay the mortgage debt. As a mortgage term, power of sale is equivalent to the term foreclosure.</p>

<p>The power of sale is language added to a mortgage document that allows the lender to sell the property if the mortgage payments are not met, thereby permitting the lender to repay the mortgage debt. A property that is foreclosed is sold by the lender (usually a bank) in order to recover losses incurred by the loan default.</p>

<p>In addition to a mortgage term, power of sale also refers to the power expressed or implied in a trust agreement permitting the trustee to sell the investments comprising the trust.</p>
