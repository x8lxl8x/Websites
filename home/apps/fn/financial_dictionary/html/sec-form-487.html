<h1>SEC Form 487</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Pre-Effective Pricing Amendments Form, that is used to amend the information contained on a previously filed SEC Form S-6 for Unit Investment Trust Registration. The information required on SEC Form 487 is the same as required on as the initial Form S-6, including management company info, risks, costs and portfolio objectives.</p>

<p>SEC Form 487 is used to make amendments <i>prior</i> to the actual issuance of a Registered Investment Trust. Oftentimes the amendments made to the original SEC Form S-6 are simply additions of information that was not available at the time of the initial filing. To help identify changes, a SEC Form 487 usually contains a "Memorandum of Change" that outlines what changes have been made.</p>
