<h1>Share Certificate</h1>

<p>A share certificate is a written document signed on behalf of a corporation, and serves as legal proof of ownership of the number of shares indicated.</p>

<p>Also referred to as a "stock certificate".</p>

<p>In modern financial markets, individual investors rarely take physical possession of their share certificates. "Scripophily" is a term that signifies the collecting of share certificates and other forms of paper based financial securities. Similar to stamp collecting or bank note collecting, a share certificate's value is dependent on its condition and age.</p>
