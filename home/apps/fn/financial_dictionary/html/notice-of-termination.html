<h1>Notice Of Termination</h1>

<p>Generally refers to the notice provided by an employer stating the date on which an employee's or employees' contract of employment will end. While a notice of termination may usually be provided to an employee for reasons unrelated to his or her job performance - for example, because business conditions necessitate layoffs or downsizing - it may also be given to an employee for poor job performance or misconduct.
The U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act has no specific requirements for notice to an employee prior to termination or layoff. However, in certain cases, employers are required to give workers advance notice of mass layoffs or plant closure.           </p>
