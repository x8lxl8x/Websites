<h1>Official Committee Of Equity Security Holders</h1>

<p>A small group of the largest shareholders in a company formed to represent all other shareholders during a company's bankruptcy trials. An official committee of equity security holders is typically made up of several of the largest shareholders of a company who stand to have the most to gain or lose during the bankruptcy proceedings, thus would serve as the best proxy for the shareholders as a whole.</p>

<p>During both Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, an official committee of equity security holders will have a say in the direction which the bankrupt company will take to appease their stake holders. While the tactics used by the committee will differ from situation to situation, the ultimate goal for the committee members is to minimize their potential losses from their equity ownership stake in the bankrupt firm.</p>
