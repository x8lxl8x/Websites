<h1>Guaranteed Renewable Policy</h1>

<p>An insurance policy feature that obligates the insurer to continue coverage as long as premiums are paid on the policy. While re-insurability is guaranteed, premiums can rise based on the filing of a claim, injury, or other factor that could increase the risk of future claims.</p>

<p>Premiums can also be raised on an entire class of insured people during the life of a guaranteed renewable policy for health, life or disability insurance.</p>

<p>Most insurers offer both guaranteed renewable policies and non-cancelable policies. If premiums are similar for both a guaranteed and a non-cancelable policy, the non-cancelable policy will offer the double guarantee of re-insurability and locked-in premiums.</p>
