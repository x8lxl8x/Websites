<h1>Group-Home Care</h1>

<p>Care given to a group of people with similar disabilities within a residence. Those in a group home receive both custodial care and care that is provided by skilled and medically trained professionals. A common disability of people in group homes is Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Caring for a family member with a disability can be a very stressful and overwhelming at times. A group home can be a viable option for those who are prevented from performing activities of daily living and whose family members may not be able to provide daily care. However, group-home facilities can be very expensive unless supplemented by long-term care insurance or public health program such as Medicare.</p>
