<h1>No-Ratio Mortgage</h1>

<p>A mortgage program in which a borrower's income isn't used or reported in qualifying the borrower for the mortgage under the standard debt-to-income ratio requirements. The loan is usually made based on the borrower's down payment, credit score or assets.</p>

<p>This type of mortgage is often chosen by individuals who don't want to disclose their incomes or who have highly variable incomes. However, this mortgage option will typically come with a higher rate than a mortgage that verifies income.</p>

<p>No-ratio mortgages usually fall into the Alt-A classification. Under Alt-A lending practices, certain exceptions to traditional mortgage underwriting guidelines - such as a debt-to-income ratio requirement - are made based on risk-based pricing. In other words, the lack of a debt-to-income ratio is a risk factor that is used in determining the mortgage's interest rate.</p>
