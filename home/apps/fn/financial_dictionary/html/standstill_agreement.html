<h1>Standstill Agreement</h1>

<p>1. A contract that stalls or stops the process of a hostile takeover. The target firm either offers to repurchase the shares held by the hostile bidder, usually at a large premium, or asks the bidder to limit its holdings. This act will stop the current attack and give the company time to take preventative measures against future takeovers.</p>

<p>2. An agreement between a lender and borrower in which the lender stops demanding the repayment of the loan. A new deal is negotiated, usually altering the loan's original repayment schedule. This is used as an alternative to bankruptcy or foreclosure when the borrower can't repay the loan.</p>

<p>1. When a target firm enters a standstill, its shareholders are usually displeased. Because the takeover is being blocked, any possible value created from the merger will be lost. Usually, share prices rise on news of a takeover. If a standstill agreement is reached, the stock value should fall to its previous level.</p>

<p>2. The standstill agreement allows the lender to salvage some value from the loan. In a foreclosure, the lender may receive nothing. By working with the borrower, the lender has a chance of being repaid.</p>
