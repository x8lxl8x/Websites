<h1>Regulatory Accounting Principles - RAP</h1>

<p>A comprehensive set of rules and regulations for accounting that were introduced by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Regulatory accounting principles were created to assist low net-worth savings and loan associations with meeting capital requirements. These rules allowed S&Ls to amortize such items as gains or losses from sales over long periods of time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the introduction of regulatory accounting principles contributed to the downfall of many S&Ls. The relaxed rules enabled many otherwise insolvent institutions to artificially increase their net worths and continue doing business. RAP stands in contrast to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).</p>
