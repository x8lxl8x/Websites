<h1>Country Club Billing</h1>

<p>A now-defunct billing system used by credit card companies up until the 1970s. Country club billing includes copies of the original sales drafts with each monthly statement sent to customers. This was done to provide proof of each purchase that was recorded on the card.</p>

<p>Country club billing was discontinued back in the 1970s due to rising costs and labor. It was replaced with a descriptive statement, which contained all of the information that was previously on the sales drafts. This system was much cheaper and faster to print and mail, and has been used ever since.</p>
