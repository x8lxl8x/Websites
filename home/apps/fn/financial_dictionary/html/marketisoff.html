<h1>Market Is Off</h1>

<p>A common phrase meaning that the stock market (or a major market index) is trading lower than at some specific point in the past. The market could be off in comparison to the previous day's closing level, last month's closing level or the closing level a year ago.</p>

<p>A synonym is "the market is down;" the opposite expression would be "the market is up."</p>

<p>Many things can cause the market to be off. During earnings season, worse-than-expected reports from a number of companies could depress the market. When reporters say "the market is off," they are often referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 key stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. If the Dow closed at 12,000 on Monday and at 11,800 on Tuesday, the market would be off at Tuesday's close.</p>
