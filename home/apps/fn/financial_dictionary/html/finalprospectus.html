<h1>Final Prospectus</h1>

<p>1. The final version of a prospectus for a public offering of securities. This document is complete in all details concerning the offering and is referred to as a "statutory prospectus" or "offering circular."</p>

<p>2. Because open-end mutual funds are continuously offering shares to the public, a fund prospectus is usually updated annually and made available to the public. Mutual fund prospectuses are all of the "final" variety.</p>

<p>1. With public offerings of securities, investors first receive what is called a preliminary prospectus, commonly called a "red herring" because of the pinkish color of the paper on which it is printed. Subsequently, the final prospectus is made available to investors who are considering a purchase of the security in question. A key difference between a final prospectus and a preliminary prospectus is that the final prospectus contains the security's price.</p>
