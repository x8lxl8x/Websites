<h1>Balance Protection </h1>

<p>The optional coverage on an existing credit card account. Typically, the fee for the balance protection is a specified percentage of the balance on the card and is added as a fee to the monthly statement. The balance protection coverage is offered to cover minimum monthly payments (and in certain cases a higher amount) in the event that the cardholder is injured or becomes unemployed.</p>

<p>The optional balance protection will provide minimum monthly payments to insure that the account does not become default in the event that the cardholder becomes injured or unemployed. Balance protection agreements vary from bank to bank; it is recommended that cardholders read "the fine print" to determine if the coverage would be beneficial. </p>
