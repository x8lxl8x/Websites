<h1>Agency Matching Contributions</h1>

<p>A benefit that federal government employees receive under the thrift savings plan. More specifically, this refers to how the agency for which the individual is working will match 100% of the individual's contributions up to the initial 3% of his or her pay and a contribution of $0.50 for every dollar from the next subsequent 2% of pay used toward contributing to the thrift savings plan.</p>

<p>For example, a federal government employee working for the Department of Labor earns $1,500 each pay period and contributes 5% (or $75) into the thrift savings plan. The Department of Labor will then contribute a total of $60 (or 3% of $1,500 + (0.5 x 2%) of $1,500) toward his retirement in additional to his $75, which creates a total contribution per pay period of $135.</p>

<p>Federal government employees that are able to contribute to a thrift savings plan should take advantage of the agency matching contribution.</p>
