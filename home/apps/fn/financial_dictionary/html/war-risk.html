<h1>War Risk</h1>

<p>1. The possibility that an investment will lose value because of a major, violent political upheaval. War generates uncertainty in the financial markets and causes many investors to panic and sell, which leads to a decline in prices.</p>

<p>2. The possibility that an individual or company will experience a major financial loss related to the destruction of property caused by a major, violent, political upheaval.</p>

<p>1. War risk falls under the broader category of political risk, which is one of several types of risk investors face. Others, to name just a few, include liquidity risk (the possibility of being unable to sell), currency risk (the possibility of an investment losing money because of a change in exchange rates) and capital risk (the possibility of losing the principal invested).</p>

<p>2. Terrorism, insurrection, military coup and other war events can create significant losses for personal and business property owners. Standard insurance policies do not always cover acts of war; in some cases, it may be necessary to purchase separate war risk insurance.</p>
