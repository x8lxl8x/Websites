<h1>Branch Automation</h1>

<p>Form of banking automation that connects the customer service desk in a bank office with the bank's customer records in the back office. Banking automation refers to the system of operating the banking process by highly automatic means so that human intervention is reduced to a minimum. Also referred to as platform automation.</p>

<p>Linking the customer service desk with the customer records enables branch account officers to book new loan applications directly with the bank's loan processing system, and also permits faster look-up of customer account information to answer questions on rates, new services and so on. Branch automation in bank branches also speeds up the processing time in handling credit applications, because paperwork is reduced.</p>
