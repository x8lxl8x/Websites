<h1>Resume</h1>

<p>A one to two page formal document that lists a job applicant's work experience, education and skills. A resume is designed to provide a detailed summary of an applicant's qualifications for a particular job - it is not usually meant to provide a complete picture. A good resume gives the potential employer enough information to believe the applicant is worth interviewing. A one-page cover letter, submitted along with the resume, can provide additional information about the applicant's qualifications.</p>

<p>A resume is typically a requirement when applying for most white collar jobs. Individuals should use their resumes to highlight specific achievements and emphasize their accomplishments. For example, when describing past work experience, a good resume will not just run through the applicant's day-to-day job responsibilities, but will also list specific accomplishments at the job, such as cutting costs or beating sales goals.</p>
