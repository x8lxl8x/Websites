<h1>BAX Contract</h1>

<p>A BAX contract is a short-term investment instrument that uses a Canadian banker's acceptance (BA) as its underlying security. The specific BA underlying the contract has a nominal value of C$1 million and a maturity of three months. The contracts are traded on the Montreal Derivatives Exchange.</p>

<p>Also known as a "banker's acceptance contract".</p>

<p>These contracts are great way for a company to hedge against a rise in interest rates. BAX contracts are becoming increasingly popular because they are a less expensive hedge than their over-the-counter competition, forward rate agreements. BAX contracts are also very liquid, flexible, and do not tie up credit lines.</p>
