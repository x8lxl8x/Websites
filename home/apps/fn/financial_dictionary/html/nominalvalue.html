<h1>Nominal Value</h1>

<p>The stated value of an issued security. Nominal value in economics also refers to a value expressed in monetary terms for a specific year or years, without adjusting for inflation. When used in reference to securities, nominal value is also known face value or par value.</p>

<p>The nominal value of a security, such as a stock or bond, remains fixed for the duration of its life. What fluctuates is the security's market value, which may be markedly different from its nominal value.</p>

<p>In economics, nominal values of measures, such as economic growth and personal income, are unadjusted for inflation. Adjusting nominal values for inflation gives rise to real values. For example, if a nation registers GDP growth of 5% in a given year and annual inflation is 2%, real GDP growth would be 3%.</p>
