<h1>Combined Ratio</h1>

<p>A measure of profitability used by an insurance company to indicate how well it is performing in its daily operations. A ratio below 100% indicates that the company is making underwriting profit while a ratio above 100% means that it is paying out more money in claims that it is receiving from premiums.</p>

<p>The combined ratio is comprised of the claims ratio and the expense ratio. The claims ratio is claims owed as a percentage of revenue earned from premiums. The expense ratio is operating costs as a percentage of revenue earned from premiums. The combined ratio is calculated by taking the sum of incurred losses and expenses and then dividing them by earned premium.</p>

<p>Calculated as:

Even if the combined ratio is above of 100%, a company can potentially still make a profit, because the ratio does not include the income received from investments.</p>

<p>Many insurance companies believe that this is the best way to measure the success of a company because it does not include investment income and therefore only includes profit that is earned through efficient management.           </p>
