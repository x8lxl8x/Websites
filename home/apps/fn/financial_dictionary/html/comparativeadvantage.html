<h1>Comparative Advantage</h1>

<p>The ability of a firm or individual to produce goods and/or services at a lower opportunity cost than other firms or individuals.  A comparative advantage gives a company the ability to sell goods and services at a lower price than its competitors and realize stronger sales margins.</p>

<p>Having a comparative advantage - or disadvantage - can shape a company's entire focus. For example, if a cruise company found that it had a comparative advantage over a similar company, due ito its closer proximity to a port, it might encourage the latter to focus on other, more productive, aspects of the business.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a comparative advantage is not the same as an absolute advantage. The latter implies that one is the <i>best</i> at something, while the former relates more to the costs of the particular endeavor.</p>
