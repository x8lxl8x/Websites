<h1>Working Control</h1>

<p>When a minority shareholder (or shareholders) has enough voting power to influence or determine corporate policy. Working control exists particularly in corporations with widely dispersed share ownership where no shareholder has a majority interest.</p>

<p>Working control exists when a minority shareholder or multiple minority shareholders unite to possess a controlling vote in a corporation. The opportunity for minority shareholders to gain this control is seen especially in corporations where there is no dominant majority (greater than 50%) shareholder. While there are no official benchmarks for defining working control, 20% ownership is often considered large enough to exhibit this level of influence.</p>
