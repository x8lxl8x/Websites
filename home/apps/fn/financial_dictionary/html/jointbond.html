<h1>Joint Bond</h1>

<p>A bond that is guaranteed by a party other than the issuer. A joint bond is an issue which is essentially a liability to multiple parties. These parties may be both corporate entities or government agencies.</p>

<p>While joint bonds can include any combination of parties, they are commonly used when a parent company is required to guarantee the bonds of a subsidiary. In such an instance, debt holders may not be interested in taking a debt investment in a subsidiary that may not share a credit rating quite as high as its parent, thus the parent company will act as an additional guarantor on the debt.</p>

<p>Also know as "joint and several bond."</p>
