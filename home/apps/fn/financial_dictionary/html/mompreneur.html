<h1>Mompreneur</h1>

<p>A slang term describing women who run their own businesses while also acting as a full time parent. Mompreneurs are more likely to run a business out of the home than out of a commercial building. Because of family obligations, mompreneurs have to balance the requirements of running a business with the demands of their children, and may do the bulk of their work during the time when their children do not require as much attention.</p>

<p>Mompreneur is a combination of the words "mom" and "entrepreneur".</p>

<p>Mompreneurs are a relatively new trend in entrepreneurship, and have come to increase prominence in the internet age, with the internet allowing entrepreneurs to sell products out of the home rather than relying on foot traffic to brick-and-mortar business. They may also take up the same line of work as they had before having children, remotely logging into office networks and telecommuting.</p>
