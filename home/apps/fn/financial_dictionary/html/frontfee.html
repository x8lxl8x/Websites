<h1>Front Fee</h1>

<p>The option premium paid by an investor upon the initial purchase of a compound option. A compound option is one where the underlying asset is also an option (i.e. an option on an option). The front fee gives the investor the right - but not the obligation - to exercise the compound option. If exercised, another fee known as the "back fee" is payable for the underlying option.</p>

<p>Compound options are used in situations where uncertainty exists regarding the requirement for risk mitigation. For example, a company may submit a bid for an overseas project. If successful, the project would generate significant revenue in a foreign currency, which may need to be hedged against exchange rate risk. A compound option would be useful in this case, because the front fee payable would be lower than the premium payable on a foreign currency option contract (which is a contingent liability in any case).</p>
