<h1>Bull Position</h1>

<p>A long position in a financial security, such as a stock in the stock market. A bull or long position seeks to profit from rising prices in certain securities. When prices rise, a bull position becomes profitable. If prices fall, the bull position is not profitable. A bull or long position is the most well-known type of position and is what is typically used in "buy and hold" investing. An alternative way to initiate a bull position can include buying call options.</p>

<p>A bull position is the opposite of a bear position. A bull position is a trade or investment that is initiated in the hopes that the instrument's price will rise and make a profit. A bull market occurs when prices are rising, and is characterized by investor optimism and confidence that prices will continue to rise.</p>
