<h1>Stock Quote</h1>

<p>The price of a stock as quoted on an exchange. A basic quote for a specific stock provides information, such as its bid and ask price, last-traded price and volume traded. Investors increasingly access stock quotes online or on mobile devices, such as smartphones, rather than through print media such as newspapers and magazines. A large number of Internet portals and websites offer delayed stock quotes at no charge, with real-time stock quotes generally restricted to paying subscribers.</p>

<p>All stocks in the U.S. have been quoted in decimals, rather than fractions, since April 9, 2001. As a result, bid-ask spreads have contracted dramatically, with spreads for the most widely traded stocks now as small as a penny, compared with 1/16th of a dollar (or $0.0625) earlier. Decimal pricing has resulted in substantial savings on transaction costs to U.S. investors because of tighter bid-ask spreads.</p>
