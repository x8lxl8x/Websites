<h1>Treasury Yield</h1>

<p>The return on investment, expressed as a percentage, on the debt obligations of the U.S. government. Treasuries are considered to be a low-risk investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which includes the government's authority to raise taxes to cover its obligations. Because of their low risk, treasuries have a low return compared to many other investments.</p>

<p>The different types of U.S. treasuries include treasury notes, treasury bills and treasury bonds, which come in different maturities up to 30 years. Each has a different yield, and the U.S. treasury publishes the yields for all of its securities daily on its website.</p>
