<h1>Excess Margin Deposit</h1>

<p>Funds deposited in a trading account beyond what is required to fund basic margin requirements. The total balance on the account equals excess margin deposits plus margin. Investors can typically open an account and start trading with only a percentage of the total security value deposited. This is called trading on margin.</p>

<p>In the forex market, an excess margin deposit may arise due to a currency trade returning to profitability after the trader has pumped in additional margin because of an earlier margin deficiency. It can also arise through a currency trade becoming significantly profitable shortly after initiation.</p>

<p>Traders may withdraw excess margin deposits if they reach a significant level, since excess capital in margin accounts pays little or no interest. However, nominal amounts of excess margin deposits may be left in the trading account as a cushion against margin calls triggered by adverse price movements.</p>
