<h1>Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premium</h1>

<p>Premium paid by homeowners on mortgage insurance for FHA loans that can be deducted in the same manner as home mortgage interest. Qualified mortgage-insurance premiums can be deducted in addition to allowable mortgage interest for up to three years. In order to qualify, the mortgage must have been originated after 2006.</p>

<p>The amount you can deduct is reduced by 10% for every $1,000 ($500 if your filing status is married filing separately) by which your adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($50,000 if your filing status is married filing separately).</p>
