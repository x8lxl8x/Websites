<h1>Deed</h1>

<p>A legal document that grants the bearer a right or privilege, provided that he or she meets a number of conditions. In order to receive the privilege - usually ownership, the bearer must be able to do so without causing others undue hardship. A person who poses a risk to society  as a result of holding a deed may be restricted in his or her ability to use the property.</p>

<p>Deeds are most known for being used to transfer the ownership of automobiles or land  between two parties.</p>

<p>For example, an individual who holds a deed for a particular section of land has a legal right to possess that land, but may not be able to build a shooting range on it because of the danger it would pose. In other cases, a holder of the title to a piece of property may be able to own the land but, for environmental reasons, not be allowed to develop it.</p>

<p>Some other popular examples of deeds are commissions, academic degrees, licenses to practice, patents and powers of attorney, each of which grant the holder a given right or privilege.</p>
