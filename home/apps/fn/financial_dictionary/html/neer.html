<h1>Nominal Effective Exchange Rate - NEER</h1>

<p>The unadjusted weighted average value of a country's currency relative to all major currencies being traded within an index or pool of currencies. The weights are determined by the importance a home country places on all other currencies traded within the pool, as measured by the balance of trade.</p>

<p>The NEER represents the relative value of a home country's currency compared to the other major currencies being traded (U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, euro, etc.). A higher NEER coefficient (above 1) means that the home country's currency will usually be worth more than an imported currency, and a lower coefficient (below 1) means that the home currency will usually be worth less than the imported currency. The NEER also represents the approximate relative price a consumer will pay for an imported good.</p>
