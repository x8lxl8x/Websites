<h1>Wolfe Wave</h1>

<p>In technical analysis, it is a naturally occurring trading pattern present in all financial markets. The pattern is composed of five waves showing supply and demand and a fight towards an equilibrium price. These patterns can develop over short- and long-term time frames such as minutes or weeks and are used to predict where a price is heading and when it will get there.</p>

<p>If identified correctly, Wolfe waves can be used to accurately predict the scope (equilibrium price) of the underlying security. To identify Wolfe waves, they must have the following characteristics:</p>

<p>Waves 3-4 must stay within the channel created by 1-2
Wave 1-2 equals waves 3-4 (shows symmetry)
Wave 4 is within the channel created by waves 1-2
There is regular time between all waves
Wave 5 exceeds trendline created by waves 1 and 3 and is the entry point</p>

<p>The estimated price is a price along the trendline created by waves 1 and 4 (point 6).</p>
