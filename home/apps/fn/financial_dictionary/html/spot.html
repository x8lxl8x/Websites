<h1>Single Payment Options Trading - SPOT</h1>

<p>A type of option product that allows an investor to set not only the conditions that need to be met in order to receive a desired payout, but also the size of the payout he or she wishes to receive if the conditions are met. The broker that provides this product will determine the likelihood that the conditions will be met and, in turn, will charge what it feels is an appropriate commission. This type of arrangement is often referred to as a "binary option" because only two types of payouts are possible for the investor:</p>

<p>1. The conditions set out by both parties occur, and the investor collects the agreed-upon payout amount.</p>

<p>2. The event does not occur and the investor loses the full premium paid to the broker.</p>

<p>This type of option product is often found in the forex market. For example, if a trader believes that the EUR/USD will not break below 1.20 in 14 days, he or she would pay a certain premium to a broker and then collect the agreed upon payout in 14 days if this scenario turns out to be accurate. However, if the EUR/USD does break below 1.20, the investor will lose the full amount of the premium.</p>
