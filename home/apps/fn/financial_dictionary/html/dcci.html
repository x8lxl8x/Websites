<h1>DUAL Commodity Channel Index - DCCI</h1>

<p>A method used in technical analysis to identify when an asset or market is overbought or oversold. DCCI is employed by graphing a smoothed Commodity Channel Index (CCI) line along with an unsmoothed one.  Crossovers of the two lines indicate possible buy and sell signals, while subsequent breaks in the price trendline are then seen as definite entry and exit points.</p>

<p>The CCI was introduced by Donald Lambert in 1980, and has grown in popularity within the technical analysis community as a signal for peaks and troughs in asset prices. The DCCI is a derivation of the CCI and adds another level of analysis to this complex trading tool.</p>
