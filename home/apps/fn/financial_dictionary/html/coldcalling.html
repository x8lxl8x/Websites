<h1>Cold Calling</h1>

<p>The solicitation of potential customers who were not anticipating such an interaction. Cold calling is a technique whereby a salesperson contacts individuals who have not previously expressed an interest in the products or services that are being offered, as opposed to warm calling. Cold calling typically refers to phone calls but can also entail drop-in visits, such as with door-to-door salespeople. In finance, cold calling can refer to a method by which brokers obtain new business by making unsolicited calls to potential clients.</p>

<p>Cold calling is a difficult task in sales because of the wide variety of responses from the potential customers, ranging from simple hang-ups to verbal abuse. Cold calling is becoming increasingly controversial as newer, more effective methods of sales channels become available, including email, text message marketing and social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Compared to cold calling, these new methods are often considered to be more efficient and effective at generating new leads.</p>
