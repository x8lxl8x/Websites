<h1>Spread-Load Contractual Plan</h1>

<p>A fee-payment structure applicable to mutual funds in which the sales charge or commission (load) is not entirely paid at the time the investor first contributes funds to the mutual fund (or in the first several contributions either). Instead, the mutual fund load is dispersed across an extended time period, so that the load is more accurately applied to each contribution.
This type of load payment plan allows greater portions of the investor's initial contributions to the account to be applied to actual investments, instead of sales charges. By doing so, the investor is able to gain a relatively larger position in the mutual fund in the short term, but their future contributions to the fund will be marginally smaller than they would have been without such a plan.          </p>
