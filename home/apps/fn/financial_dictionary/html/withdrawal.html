<h1>Withdrawal</h1>

<p>Removing funds from an account, plan, pension or trust. In some cases, conditions must be met in order to withdraw funds without penalization. There are two ways to withdraw money: in cash or in kind.</p>

<p>Withdrawal can be done over a period of time in fixed or variable amounts or in one lump sum. Penalization for early withdrawal usually arises when a clause in an investment contract is broken. Cash withdrawal requires converting the holdings of an account, plan, pension or trust into cash, usually through a sale. In kind withdrawal is simply taking possession of assets and does not require conversion to cash.</p>
