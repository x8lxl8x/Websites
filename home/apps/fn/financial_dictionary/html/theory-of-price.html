<h1>Theory Of Price</h1>

<p>An economic theory that contends that the price for any specific good/service is the relationship between the forces of supply and demand. The theory of price says that the point at which the benefit gained from those who demand the entity meets the seller's marginal costs is the most optimal market price for the good/service.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that market forces determine that it costs $5 for a widget. This suggests that widget buyers are willing to forgo the utility in $5 in order to possess the widget and that the widget seller perceives that $5 is a fair price in exchange for giving up the widget. This simple theory of determining prices is one of the core principles underlying economic theory.</p>
