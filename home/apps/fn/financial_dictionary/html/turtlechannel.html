<h1>Turtle Channel</h1>

<p>A trading band created by plotting the highest and lowest prices of an asset over a certain time period around the price of that asset.</p>

<p>This indicator is interpreted in a similar manner to other banded indicators such as Keltner channels and moving average envelopes. Some investors use a move toward the upper band to signal an increased likelihood that the security is becoming overbought, and a move to the lower band to signal that a security may be oversold. Other investors believe that a move beyond the upper band of the channel is an indication that upward momentum is increasing, and a move below the lower band is an indication that downward momentum is building.           </p>
