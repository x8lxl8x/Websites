<h1>Specific Risk</h1>

<p>Risk that affects a very small number of assets. Specific risk, as its name would imply, relates to risks that are very specific to a company or small group of companies. This type of risk would be the opposite of an overall market risk, or systematic risk.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as "unsystematic or diversifiable risk."</p>

<p>An example of specific risk would be news that is specific to either one stock or a small number of stocks, such as a sudden strike by the employees of a company, or a new governmental regulation affecting a particular group of companies. Unlike systematic risk or market risk, specific risk can be diversified away.</p>
