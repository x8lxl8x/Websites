<h1>Graduation Period</h1>

<p>The period of time on a graduated payment mortgage during which the monthly payment rises by a certain percentage at set intervals, usually annually. The interest rate at which monthly payments are set to increase by is fixed over the entire graduation period. If the actual payment is less than what an interest-only payment would be, negative amortization is created.</p>

<p>Graduated-payment mortgages are similar to payment option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs); however, a graduated-payment mortgage is a fixed-rate mortgage. The benefit of a graduated-payment mortgage over a payment option ARM is that the borrower knows in advance, and for certain, what the payments and remaining principal balance of the mortgage will be over the entire life of the mortgage.</p>
