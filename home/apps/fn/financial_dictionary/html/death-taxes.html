<h1>Death Taxes</h1>

<p>Taxes imposed by the federal and/or state government on someone's estate upon their death. These taxes are levied on the beneficiary that receives the property in the deceased's will; the tax amount is based on the property's value at the time of the owner's death. Also called death duties or inheritance tax.</p>

<p>The term was first coined in the 1990s to describe estate and inheritance taxes by those who want such taxes eliminated.</p>
