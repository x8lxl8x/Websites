<h1>Bank Giro Transfer</h1>

<p>A method of transferring money by instructing a bank to directly transfer funds from one bank account to another without the use of checks. Bank giro transfers are predominantly used in European countries such as Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, where they are seen as an effective way for companies to receive payments from foreign customers.</p>

<p>Also known as a "Giro credit".</p>

<p>The bank giro transfer was developed to help companies increase their ability to receive payments on the goods and services that they provide. Customers can pay using a giro transfer either through the mail or online. Giro transfers have become a more accepted payment method than checks because they provide security when lost or stolen, and they can be processed more quickly than a standard check.</p>
