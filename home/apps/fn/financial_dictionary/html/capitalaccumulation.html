<h1>Capital Accumulation</h1>

<p>This refers to profits that a company uses to increase its capital base. Capital accumulation involves acquiring more assets that can be used to create more wealth or that will appreciate in value.</p>

<p>Alternatively, capital accumulation can also refer to when an institutional broker or individual investor acquires a large number of shares of a particular stock or mutual fund over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Institutional brokers may employ this strategy when they find a particular company attractive and want to acquire a significant number of shares of its stock without driving up the price. Investors employ this strategy through regular investing in a particular mutual fund in which they reinvest dividends and capital gains.</p>
