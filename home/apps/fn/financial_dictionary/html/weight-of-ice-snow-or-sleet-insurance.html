<h1>Weight Of Ice, Snow Or Sleet Insurance </h1>

<p>Financial protection against damage caused to property by winter weather specifically, damage caused if a roof caves in because of the weight of ice, snow or sleet. This type of coverage is available through a residential or commercial real estate insurance policy. Depending on the insurer, this coverage may be included in a basic insurance policy, or it may need to be purchased separately.</p>

<p>The owner of a property in an area that is susceptible to winter storms should be aware of whether his or her basic hazard insurance policy covers damage caused by winter storms. Such damage can include wind damage, fallen trees, burst pipes and damage caused by snow, ice or sleet. It is also important to note whether the policy only covers damage to the structure or whether it also provides coverage for the contents of the structure.</p>
