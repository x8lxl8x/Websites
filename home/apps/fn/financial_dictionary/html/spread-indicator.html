<h1>Spread Indicator</h1>

<p>An indicator that shows the difference between the bid and ask price of a security, currency or asset. The spread indicator is typically used in a chart to graphically represent the spread at a glance, and is a popular tool among forex traders. The indicator, displayed as a curve, shows the direction of the spread as it relates to the bid and ask price. Usually, highly liquid currency pairs have lower spreads.</p>

<p>Spreads are calculated metrics that often requires that a trader manually determine the difference between bid and ask prices. For traders trying to capture small fluctuations in the spread, determining the spread requires handling quotes with a large number following the decimal. As a result, the spread indicator fluctuates over a very narrow range.</p>
