<h1>SEC Form F-10</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that publicly-traded Canadian foreign private issuers are required to use. These issuers must have been subject to continuous disclosure by a Canadian authority over the 12 months preceding the filing, in order to register any securities (except certain derivative securities). Companies filing an SEC Form F-10 must have an aggregate market value of public float or outstanding equity of at least $75 million. This form is a wraparound form for the relevant Canadian offering documents required by securities regulation in Canada, and unlike SEC Forms F-7, F-8, F-9 and F-80, SEC Form F-10 requires the Canadian issuer to reconcile its financial statements to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p>

<p>Form F-10 is also known as the Registration Statement for Securities of Certain Canadian Issuers Offered for Cash upon the Exercise of Rights Granted to Existing Security Holders, under the Securities Act of 1933. This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
