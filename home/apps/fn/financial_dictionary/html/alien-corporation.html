<h1>Alien Corporation</h1>

<p>A corporation that was created in another country. Alien corporations are most commonly classified as any corporation that is formed outside of the United States. Other countries do not refer to U.S.-based corporations with this term.</p>

<p>Alien corporations are also referred to as foreign corporations. However, they are technically distinct from these entities. Most states in the U.S. consider a foreign corporation to be one that was merely established in another state.</p>
