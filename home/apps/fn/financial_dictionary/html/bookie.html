<h1>Bookie</h1>

<p>Someone who facilitates gambling, commonly on sporting events, by setting odds, accepting and placing bets, and paying out winnings on behalf of other people. "Bookie" is a slang term for "bookmaker." Bookies do not usually make their money by placing bets themselves, but by charging a transaction fee on their customers' bets known as a "vigorish," or "the vig." Bookies may also lend money to bettors.</p>

<p>The types of gambling enabled by bookies are not always legal. Bookmaking and placing bets through a bookmaker can also be illegal. The legality of different types of gambling is determined by state governments. Some people have referred to their broker as their bookie due to large commissions and the broker's insistence on trading with regularity.</p>
