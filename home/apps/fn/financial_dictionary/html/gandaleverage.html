<h1>General And Administrative Leverage</h1>

<p>A variable within a cost benefit analysis of an acquisition where the potential reduction in overall general and administrative expenses of the combined company are considered. Through synergies and cost-saving programs, the general and administrative costs of the combined company often will be considerably less than the sum of the general and administrative costs of the two independent companies. The more the potential savings, the more attractive the acquisition becomes, when all else is equal.
When valuing an acquisition it is essential that a company accurately value the benefit of a target company's general and administrative leverage. One of the reasons, a company would want to acquire another company is the economies of scale that can be achieved. Subsequently, if the cost savings that have been identified from general and administrative leverage are overestimated, the acquiring company may be worse off after the acquisition. But it is important to note that this is only one aspect of the overall analysis of a potential acquisition.          </p>
