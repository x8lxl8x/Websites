This chart shows a stock that has historically encountered a lot of resistance near $37, but notice how it heads sharply higher following the breakout.</p>

<p>In practice, a breakout is most commonly used to refer to a situation where the price breaks above a level of resistance and heads higher, rather than breaking below a level of support and heading lower. Once a resistance level is broken, it is regarded as the next level of support when the asset experiences a pullback  Most traders use chart patterns and other technical tools such as trendlines to identify possible candidates that are likely to break through a support/resistance level.</p>

<p>A breakout is the bullish counterpart to a breakdown.</p>
