<h1>New Zealand Superannuation Fund</h1>

<p>A New Zealand government fund established in response to the projected increase in the cost of funding the New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) - the retirement benefit paid to all eligible citizens aged 65 and over - due to the country's aging population.</p>

<p>The fund was established in 2001 and is governed by a separate Crown entity called the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation, which is overseen by a board selected by New Zealand's Ministry of Finance. It is a funded on a "pay as you go" basis, which means that the cost of paying NZS in any given year is paid from the taxes levied on incomes of the working population in that year. The fund's assets totaled $15.8 billion by May 2010, and its size is not projected to peak until 2056.</p>
