<h1>Below Par</h1>

<p>A term describing a bond whose price is below the face value or principal value, usually $1,000. As bond prices are quoted as a percentage of face value, a price below par would typically be anything less than 100.</p>

<p>A bond trading below par is the same as a bond trading at a discount. When a bond trades below par, its current yield is higher than its fixed coupon rate.</p>

<p>Bonds may trade below par when interest rates have risen since it was issued, its credit rating has declined, there are concerns about a default, or there is an excess supply. A bond's discount may narrow as it approaches maturity or its first call date, when investors will receive par value.</p>
