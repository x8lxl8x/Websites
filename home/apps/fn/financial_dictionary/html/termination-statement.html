<h1>Termination Statement</h1>

<p>A statement that releases a lender's claim on property or collateral of a borrower when a loan is repaid. Termination statements also terminate the financing statement created by the loan. These statements officially clear the borrower's name of the lien in public records.</p>

<p>The Uniform Commercial Code mandates that all secured lenders sign termination statements for loans that are repaid in full. Unsecured lenders are not required to sign this form. Once a termination statement has been signed, the assets that were pledged as collateral under the previous obligations cannot be used to reassure the payments of future loans.</p>
