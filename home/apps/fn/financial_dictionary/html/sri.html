<h1>Socially Responsible Investment - SRI</h1>

<p>An investment that is considered socially responsible because of the nature of the business the company conducts. Common themes for socially responsible investments include avoiding investment in companies that produce or sell addictive substances (like alcohol, gambling and tobacco) and seeking out companies engaged in environmental sustainability and alternative energy/clean technology efforts. Socially responsible investments can be made in individual companies or through a socially conscious mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>

<p>"Socially conscious" investing is growing into a widely-followed practice, as there are dozens of new funds and pooled investment vehicles available for retail investors. Mutual funds and ETFs provide an added advantage in that investors can gain exposure to multiple companies across many sectors with a single investment. Investors should read carefully through fund prospectuses to determine the exact philosophies being employed by fund managers.</p>

<p>Just because an investment touts itself as socially responsible doesn't mean that it will provide investors with a good return.</p>
