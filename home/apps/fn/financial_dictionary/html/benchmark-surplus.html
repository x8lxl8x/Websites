<h1>Benchmark Surplus</h1>

<p>Benchmark surplus is an insurance term that refers to the amount of surplus from an additional capital source that would be necessary to act as a supplement to the cash flow.

<p>Benchmark surplus refers to any needed additional equity or surplus beyond the equity or surplus currently held by an insurance company or industry. Benchmark surplus is the liquid assets required in addition to those currently held currently held, that an insurance company would need to cover additional benefit claims.</p>
