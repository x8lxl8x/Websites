<h1>Yearly Renewable Term - YRT</h1>

<p>A one-year term life insurance policy. This type of policy gives policy holders a quote for the year the coverage is bought. When you buy the yearly renewable term insurance policy, the premium you are quoted is for you at the given year that you request the quote. At this same time next year you will pay a premium for a person in your same exact situation but one year older. The following year the premium increases again as you will be paying a premium for a person two years older. Premiums increase annually in order to cover increased risk with age. Also referred to as increasing premium term insurance and annual renewal term assurance.</p>

<p>Actuaries are in charge of figuring out what premium will be charged based on different risk variables. Based on a specific formula using these variables, actuaries can figure out at what age a policyholder will die. As the holder grows older, premiums to the policy can be added. These polices tend to be attractive to young insurance seekers who want to start out with a low cost, flexible premium. It also pays a death benefit to any named beneficiary if the policy holder passes away within the one-year term.</p>
