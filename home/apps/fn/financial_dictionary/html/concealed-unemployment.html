<h1>Concealed Unemployment</h1>

<p>When people who are out of work are not counted in official unemployment statistics for a variety of reasons. Those potential workers falling into this category typically include individuals who have given up looking for employment, those who have taken an early retirement even though they would prefer to still be employed and those with seasonal or part time employment.</p>

<p>Unemployment statistics do not always accurately reflect the number of unemployed people in the workforce. Unemployment statistics typically are derived only from those people who are both out of work and actively seeking a job. Concealed unemployment figures are typically not used in statistical calculations. People who are out of work do not always file for unemployment benefits, and it is these potential workers that create concealed unemployment.</p>
