<h1>Guarantor</h1>

<p>A person who guarantees to pay for someone else's debt if he or she should default on a loan obligation. A guarantor acts as a co-signor of sorts, in that they pledge their own assets or services if a situation arises in which the original debtor cannot perform their obligations.</p>

<p>Usually, people or businesses with poor or limited credit history can only get a loan if they have a guarantor. For example, an individual with a comparatively low credit score looking to obtain a line of credit to cover unforeseen expenses may be required by the bank to find a guarantor before the bank will issue them the line of credit.</p>
