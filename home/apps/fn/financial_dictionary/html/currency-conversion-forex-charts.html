<h1>Forex Charts</h1>

<p>A charting package that allows a trader to view historical currency exchange rates. Currency charts are provided within forex charting software, which usually comes free of charge when a trading account is opened with a forex broker. As with charts used for trading other securities, like stocks or futures, they are used primarily by the technical analyst, or chartist.</p>

<p>Which forex charting software provides the best charts of foreign currencies? Because the software from each forex broker is so different, the answer is very personal.</p>

<p>Most forex brokers allow you to open a demo account prior to funding a full account or mini account. Be sure to try out each broker's charting software during their trial periods to help you better decide which broker is the best for you.</p>
