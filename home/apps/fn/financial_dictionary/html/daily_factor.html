<h1>Daily Factor</h1>

<p>A decimal representing the portion of an annual yield earned in one day. Daily factors are often reported alongside current annualized yield figures, and can be translated back to the current yield by multiplying the number by 365.</p>

<p>For example, a certificate of deposit that trades for a current annual yield of 5.35% will show a daily factor of (.0535 / 365) or .000146575</p>

<p>Daily factors are small amounts to be sure, but many high-level banking and trust institutions will provide this daily interest calculation to their most important institutional accounts. The larger the pool of invested assets becomes, the more meaningful a daily factor calculation will be to the current account balances.</p>

<p>Daily factors are also frequently shown for Treasury bond quotes.</p>
