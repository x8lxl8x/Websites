<h1>Production Volume Variance</h1>

<p>The amount of fixed overhead costs that are not allocated to a product because actual production varies from budgeted production. Also known as fixed overhead volume variance.</p>

<p>Mathematically, production volume variance is expressed as:</p>

<p><b>(Actual Production - Budgeted Production) x Budgeted Overhead Rate</b></p>

<p>With the budgeted overhead rate defined as (budgeted fixed overhead / budgeted production). It may also be expressed as:</p>

<p><b>(Actual Production - Factory Capacity) x Budgeted Overhead Rate</b></p>

<p>With the budgeted overhead rate defined as (budgeted fixed overhead / factory capacity); in this case, production volume variance represents the cost of idle factory capacity.</p>

<p>When actual production is greater than budgeted production, production volume variance is favorable, since total fixed overhead is allocated to a greater number of units resulting in a lower production cost per unit and consequently greater profitability. Conversely, when actual production is lower than budgeted production, production volume variance is unfavorable.</p>
