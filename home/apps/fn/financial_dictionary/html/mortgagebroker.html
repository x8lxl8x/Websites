<h1>Mortgage Broker</h1>

<p>An intermediary who brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together, but does not use its own funds to originate mortgages. A mortgage broker gathers paperwork from a borrower, and passes that paperwork along to a mortgage lender for underwriting and approval.  The mortgage funds are then lent in the name of the mortgage lender. A mortgage broker collects an origination fee and/or a yield spread premium from the lender as compensation for its services.</p>

<p>A mortgage broker is not to be confused with a mortgage banker, which closes and funds a mortgage with its own funds. Mortgage brokers frequently facilitate transactions for mortgage bankers.</p>
