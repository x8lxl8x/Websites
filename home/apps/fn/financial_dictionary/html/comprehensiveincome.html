<h1>Comprehensive Income</h1>

<p>The change in a company's net assets from nonowner sources over a specified period of time. Comprehensive income is a statement of all income and expenses recognized during that period. The statement includes revenue, finance costs, tax expenses, discontinued operations, profit share and profit/loss.</p>

<p>Companies typically report comprehensive income in a separate statement from income resulting from owner changes in equity, but have the option of providing information in a single statement. Many firms shy away from the single statement approach because it mixes owner and nonowner activity, which can muddle the underlying information.</p>
