<h1>Advertised Price</h1>

<p>The price of a product or service as displayed or announced in an advertisement or radio/TV commercial. If the advertised price is well below the normal price of a product, it is likely to be a loss-leader that is priced to entice customers into the retail store in the hopes that they will make additional purchases.</p>

<p>A company may offer a price-matching guarantee to its customers, based on the advertised price for a specific product. If a rival offers the same product for a lower advertised price, the company will either match the lower price or refund the difference if the customer has already purchased the product from it.</p>

<p>There are strict laws in North America against false or misleading selling price representations, such as sales made above an advertised price. Stiff fines are payable by a company that sells a product above its advertised price, except in cases where the advertised price was a mistake that was rectified promptly.</p>
