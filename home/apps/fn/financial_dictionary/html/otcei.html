<h1>Over-The-Counter Exchange Of India - OTCEI</h1>

<p>An electronic stock exchange based in India that is comprised of small- and medium-sized firms looking to gain access to the capital markets. Like electronic exchanges in the U.S. such as the Nasdaq, there is no central place of exchange and all trading is done through electronic networks.</p>

<p>The first electronic OTC stock exchange in India was established in 1990 to provide investors and companies with an additional way to trade and issue securities. This was the first exchange in India to introduce market makers, which are firms that hold shares in companies and facilitate the trading of securities by buying and selling from other participants.</p>
