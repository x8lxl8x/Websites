<h1>Farm Team</h1>

<p>A baseball reference applied to businesses that train employees only to have them leave for competing firms. A farm team typically has non-ideal practices that cause high employee turnover -  often to bigger  and more prestigious companies.</p>

<p>Like sport farm teams, these companies fully train the employees only to have them leave to work for another company. Being a farm team for your competitors will often, over time, lead to the destruction of the business.</p>
