<h1>Bad Debt Recovery</h1>

<p>A debt from a loan, credit line or accounts receivable that is recovered either in whole or in part after it has been written off or classified as a bad debt. Because it generally generates a loss when it is written off, a bad debt recovery usually produces income.</p>

<p>In accounting, the bad debt recovery would credit the "allowance for bad debts" or "bad debt reserve" categories, and reduce the "accounts receivable" category in the books.</p>

<p>Not all bad debt recoveries are "like-kind" recoveries.  For example, a collateralized loan that has been written off may be partially recovered through sale of the collateral.  Or, a bank may receive equity in exchange for writing off a loan, which could later result in recovery of the loan and, perhaps, some additional profit.</p>
