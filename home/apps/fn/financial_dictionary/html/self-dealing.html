<h1>Self-Dealing</h1>

<p>A situation in which a fiduciary acts in his own best interest in a transaction rather than in the best interest of his clients. A fiduciary is legally obligated to act in the best interest of his clients. If he breaches this obligation, the wronged party can sue the fiduciary for monetary damages.</p>

<p>Individuals who may be in the position of fiduciary include trustees, attorneys, corporate officers, board members and financial advisors. An example of self-dealing would be if a broker knowingly advised his clients to purchase products which would cause them harm, but would pay the broker a hefty commission.</p>
