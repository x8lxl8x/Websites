<h1>Annualized Rate</h1>

<p>A rate of return for a given period that is less than one year, but that is computed as if the rate were for a full year. The annualized rate is essentially an estimated rate of annual return that is extrapolated mathematically.</p>

<p>The annualized rate is calculated by multiplying the change in rate of return in one month by 12 (or one quarter by four).</p>

<p>For example, if one month's rate of return is 0.25% and the next month's is 0.35%, the change in the rate of return from one month to the next is 0.10% (0.35-0.25). The annualized rate of return is equal to 0.10% x 12 = 1.2%.</p>
