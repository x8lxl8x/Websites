<h1>Com-Dev Company</h1>

<p>Shortened form of "Commercial Development Company." These companies build and sell/lease commercial real-estate, software or applications for wide-scale commercial use. In the context of a specific stock, COM DEV may also refer to a Canadian developer and manufacturer of space hardware subsystems that has more 50% share of the global communications satellite market for its core products.</p>

<p>Com-dev companies are typically involved in projects that take a number of years to develop, such as building up viable real-estate or software is a time-intensive process. While most com-dev companies are also referred to as business-to-business (B2B) companies, usage of these two terms has dwindled over the past decade, and neither of them is widely used at present.</p>
