<h1>Form S-4</h1>

<p>A form that must be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the event of a merger or an acquisition between two companies. The form must also be submitted for exchange offers.
An exchange offer occurs when a company or a financial institution offers to exchange securities that it provides for similar securities at less demanding terms. This is often done in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Submissions of this form are closely watched by investors who attempt to make quick gains from M&A activity.</p>
