<h1>SEC Form 497K1</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Profiles for Certain Open-Ended Investment Companies Form, used to file official copies of a "Short-Form Prospectus" for open-ended mutual funds. The information contained on SEC Form 497K1 includes the risks, costs, potential holdings, and redemption procedures for an open-ended mutual fund being sold to the public.</p>

<p>SEC Form 497K1 is used to file an abbreviated version of a mutual fund prospectus, that is meant to be much easier for investors to review and understand. Prior to the Short Form Prospectus, investors had to search through the much larger full-length prospectus to find the information required to make informed investment choices. In addition to benefiting the consumer, the use of a SEC Form 497K1 dramatically reduces the costs for mutual funds associated with delivering those larger prospectuses to customers.</p>
