<h1>Fixed-Period ARM</h1>

<p>An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with an initial fixed-interest-rate period. After the fixed-interest rate expires, the interest rate starts to adjust based on an index plus a margin.  The amount by which the interest rate can adjust after the fixed period is usually subject to an interest rate cap structure.</p>

<p>These are often called "hybrid ARMs".</p>

<p>Typically, in the prime mortgage market, fixed-period ARMs are offered with fixed-interest rate periods of three, five, seven and 10 years. In the subprime market a two-year fixed-rate period is frequently offered. Typically, the shorter the fixed-interest rate period, the lower the interest rate will be. A borrower should carefully consider their time horizon when choosing a fixed-period ARM and recognize the risks associated with the expiration of the fixed-interest rate period.</p>
