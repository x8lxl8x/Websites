<h1>A-Credit</h1>

<p>The highest credit grade available as assigned to a borrower by a lender. Lenders use a credit grading system to qualify borrowers. The higher the borrower's credit grade, the lower the interest rate offered to that borrower on a loan.</p>

<p>Credit grading by lenders is based on many factors, including a borrower's FICO score, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio and past delinquencies. This grade of credit may be associated with a plus or minus for more depth. In this case, a grade of "A+" would indicate higher credit worthiness than a score of "A-".</p>
