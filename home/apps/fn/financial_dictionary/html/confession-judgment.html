<h1>Confession Of Judgment</h1>

<p>A written agreement signed by the defendant that accepts the liability and amount of damages that was agreed on. A confession of judgment is a way to circumvent normal court proceedings and avoid a lengthy legal process to resolve a dispute. Signing a confession of forfeits any of the rights the defendant has to dispute a claim in the future.</p>

<p>Also, the same effect of a confession of judgment can be attained by having a borrower sign a cognovit note when the borrow first becomes in debt to the lender. The note would say how much the debtor owed and that the debtor voluntarily subjects himself/herself to court authority to resolve any dispute. If the debtor defaults, the note could be presented to the court to obtain a judgment without even notifying the debtor of the court proceedings. Many people feel this is controversial because it doesn't allow the defendant to present a proper defense.</p>
