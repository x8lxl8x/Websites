<h1>Required Minimum Distribution - RMD</h1>

<p>The amount that Traditional, SEP and SIMPLE IRA owners and qualified plan participants must begin distributing from their retirement accounts by April 1 following the year they reach age 70.5. RMD amounts must then be distributed each subsequent year.</p>

<p>These required minimum distributions are determined by dividing the prior year-end fair market value of the retirement account by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy.</p>

<p>Some qualified plans will allow certain participants to defer beginning their RMDs until they retire, even if they are older than age 70.5. Qualified plan participants should check with their employers to determine whether they are eligible for this deferral.</p>
