<h1>Credit Analyst</h1>

<p>A financial professional who has expertise in evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses. Credit analysts determine the likelihood that a borrower will be able to meet financial obligations and pay back a loan, often by reviewing the borrower's financial history and determining whether market conditions will be conducive to repayment.</p>

<p>Credit analysts, besides being skilled at financial statement analysis, use a number of ratios when reviewing the financial history of a potential borrower. They focus on determining whether the borrower will have sufficient cash flows by comparing ratios to industry standards, other borrowers and historical trends. For example, a credit analyst at a bank may analyze a company's financial statements before providing a loan for a new factory.</p>
