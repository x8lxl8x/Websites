<h1>Activity Quota</h1>

<p>A minimum level of sales-oriented actions that must be met by a salesperson during a given time period. An activity quota may require a salesperson to make a certain number of outbound calls, send a certain number of emails to potential clients or submit a certain number of statements of work. The quota is not typically based directly on a revenue figure requirement, but is related to the actions that lead to a sale being made.</p>

<p>Activity quotas are often used in situations in which salespeople have to contact potential clients. The quota is designed to ensure that the salesperson is making a minimum level of effort to attract new clients, and employers may reward employees who surpass the activity quota as an incentive to put in more effort.</p>
