<h1>Buy To Open</h1>

<p>A term used by many brokerages to represent the opening of a long call or put position in option transactions. A "buy to open" order has a distinguishing characteristic where the option position is not held short in the account during the transaction. The "sell to close" order is used to exit a position taken with a "buy to open" order.</p>

<p>The buy and sell terminology for options trading is not as straightforward as it is for stock trading. Instead of simply placing a "buy" or "sell" order as they would for stocks, options traders must choose among "buy to open," "buy to close," "sell to open," and "sell to close." Beginning options traders should ensure that they understand the terminology and that they place their orders carefully to avoid preventable mistakes.</p>
