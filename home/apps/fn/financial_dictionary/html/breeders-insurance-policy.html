<h1>Breeder's Insurance Policy</h1>

<p>Insurance coverage for the damage, theft or loss of bred animals. A breeder's insurance policy may also cover veterinary bills for animals in the event of illness or accident, as well as cover the loss in the event of the death of the animal.</p>

<p>Like all other businesses, breeding is often the livelihood of a family. Dog breeders and livestock owners stand to suffer greatly in the event of a loss. It is for this reason that all assets must be fully insured under a sound breeder's insurance policy. Liability insurance is also a must-have for all business owners.</p>
