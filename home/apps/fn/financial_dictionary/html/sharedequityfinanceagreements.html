<h1>Shared Equity Finance Agreements</h1>

<p>When two parties purchase a primary residence because one party is unable to purchase the residence on its own. In a shared equity finance agreement, the financially stronger party acts as the investing owner, while the other party is the occupying owner. These agreements are usually charitable in nature, and state that the latter party must pay a proportional share of the mortgage payment as well as expenses, such as insurance and property taxes.</p>

<p>Shared equity finance agreements are often used by parents who desire to help their children purchase a home. In most cases the occupant pays the investor a monthly rental payment above and beyond the proportional share of expenses. The investing party is usually able to deduct its share of expenses paid, including depreciation.</p>
