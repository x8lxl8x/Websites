<h1>American Academy Of Actuaries - AAA</h1>

<p>A group that provides analysis to aid in public policy creation, advances the status of the actuarial profession, and sets standards of integrity and competence for actuaries. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has five public policy councils in the areas of casualty, health, life, risk management and financial reporting, and pensions. These councils lobby Congress on actuarial issues with national implications, such as Social Security and Medicare.</p>

<p>Members of the American of Actuaries must have approved actuarial education credentials, must have relevant work experience, and must agree to uphold the organization's code of professional conduct. Actuaries commonly work in financial services, where they use math, statistics, and economic and financial analysis to evaluate, manage, and solve issues within the discipline.</p>
