<h1>Broker Booth Support System - BBSS</h1>

<p>An electronic system used by the New York Stock Exchange to send orders between brokers and trading booths on the floor of the exchange. The BBSS is an extremely efficient way to direct order flow. Prior to its advent, brokers used paper forms and sent runners to give orders to the floor traders to execute.</p>

<p>The BBSS permits the New York Stock Exchange to handle daily trade volumes in excess of one billion shares. If this electronic system of routing orders were unavailable, brokers and traders would have to rely on paper forms to document and execute trades. In addition to being a physically demanding process, the paper format is much more difficult to audit and track than its electronic counterpart.</p>
