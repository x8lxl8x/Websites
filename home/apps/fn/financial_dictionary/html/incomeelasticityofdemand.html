<h1>Income Elasticity Of Demand</h1>

<p>A measure of the relationship between a change in the quantity demanded for a particular good and a change in real income. Income elasticity of demand is an economics term that refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain product in response to a change in consumer incomes. The formula for calculating income elasticity of demand is:</p>

<p><b>Income Elasticity of Demand = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income</b></p>

<p>For example, if the quantity demanded for a good increases for 15% in response to a 10%increase in income, the income elasticity of demand would be <b>15% / 10% = 1.5. </b>The degree to which the quantity demanded for a good changes in response to a change in income depends on whether the good is a necessity or a luxury.</p>

<p>Normal goods have a positive income elasticity of demand. As incomes rise, more goods are demanded at each price level. The quantity demanded for normal necessities will increase with income, but at a slower rate than luxury goods. This is because consumers, rather than buying more of the necessities, will likely use their increased income to purchase more luxury goods and services. During a period of increasing incomes, the quantity demanded for luxury products tends to increase at a higher rate than the quantity demanded for necessities. The quantity demanded for luxury goods is very sensitive to changes in income.</p>

<p>Inferior goods have a negative income elasticity of demand - the quantity demanded for inferior goods falls as incomes rise. For example, the quantity demanded for generic food items tends to decrease during periods of increased incomes.</p>

<p>Businesses evaluate income elasticity of demand for various products to help predict the impact of a business cycle of product sales.</p>
