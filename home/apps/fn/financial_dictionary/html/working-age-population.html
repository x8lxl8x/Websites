<h1>Working-Age Population</h1>

<p>The total population in a region, within a set range of ages, that is considered to be able and likely to work. The working-age population measure is used to give an estimate of the total number of potential workers within an economy. Each region may have a different range of ages, but typically the ages of 20 to 65 are used.</p>

<p>This measure considers all individuals in a region between these ages, but doesn't differentiate between those that are actually working and those that are currently unemployed. The working-age population of an economy is always shifting as the demographics of a region change, with large changes having the potential to significantly impact the economy. For example, if you have a relatively small working-age population when compared to the youth and retired segments, the economy will rely on a smaller population to generate revenues while a larger population of youth and retired segments rely on social programs.</p>
