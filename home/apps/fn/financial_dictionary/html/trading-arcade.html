<h1>Trading Arcade</h1>

<p>A slang term for an electronic trading facility where local investors can get together and trade for their own accounts. The arcade is often run by a member of a clearing organization, and has no physical trading area or pit.</p>

<p>The users of an arcade are referred to as "e-locals", because their trading activities are all electronically executed. Trading arcades are often large rooms with computer terminals and television sets everywhere, allowing traders to react quickly to news and enjoy the convenience of electronic trades.</p>
