<h1>Defensive Interval Ratio</h1>

<p>An efficiency ratio that measures how many days a company can operate without having to access non-current (long-term) assets.</p>

<p>The defensive interval ratio (DIR) is calculated as:</p>

<p><b>DIR = Current Assets / Daily Operational Expenses</b></p>

<p>Also known as the "Defensive Interval Period".</p>

<p>The DIR is thought by many people to be a better liquidity measure than the quick and current ratios. Because these ratios compare assets to liabilities rather than comparing assets to expenses, the DIR and current/quick ratios would give quite different results if the company had alot of expenses, but no debt.</p>

<p>The DIR is not a replacement to the other ratios, but a complement. As with all financial analysis, a prudent investor will use a basket of different analysis when deciding on whether a company is a good investment.</p>
