<h1>Domestic Corporation</h1>

<p>A company that conducts its affairs in its home country. A domestic corporation is often taxed differently than a foreign corporation, and may be required to pay duties or fees on the importation of its products. Typically, a domestic corporation is able to conduct business in other states or other parts of the country where it has filed its articles of incorporation.</p>

<p>Business that are incorporated in a different country from which they originate are referred to as foreign corporations.</p>

<p>Many companies in the United States are incorporated in Delaware, meaning that they are subject to the laws of that state. If a company incorporates in Delaware but does not do business there, it is considered an out-of-state corporation or a foreign corporation.</p>
