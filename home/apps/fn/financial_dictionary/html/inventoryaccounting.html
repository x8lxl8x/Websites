<h1>Inventory Accounting</h1>

<p>The body of accounting that deals with valuing and accounting for changes in inventoried assets. Changes in value can occur for a number of reasons including depreciation, deterioration, obsolescence, change in customer taste, increased demand, decreased market supply and so on.</p>

<p>It is a requirement of GAAP that inventory be properly accounted for according to a very particular set of standards, so as to limit the potential of overstating profit by understating inventory value, and to limit the potential to overstate a company's value by overstating the value of inventory which has in fact materially depreciated in value.</p>
