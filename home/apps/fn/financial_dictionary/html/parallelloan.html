<h1>Parallel Loan</h1>

<p>A type of foreign exchange loan agreement that was a precursor to currency swaps. A parallel loan involves two parent companies taking loans from their respective national financial institutions and then lending the resulting funds to the other company's subsidiary.</p>

<p>For example, ABC, a Canadian company, would borrow Canadian dollars from a Canadian bank and XYZ, a French company, would borrow euros from a French bank. Then ABC would lend the Canadian funds to XYZ's Canadian subsidiary and XYZ would lend the euros to ABC's French subsidiary.</p>

<p>The first parallel loans were implemented in the 1970s in the United Kingdom in order to bypass taxes that were imposed to make foreign investments more expensive.</p>
