<h1>Notice To Creditors</h1>

<p>A public notice to the creditors and debtors of an estate. The notice to creditors is usually posted in the public newspaper. The notice requests all interested parties to appear in court and either present their claim or make their payment.</p>

<p>A notice to creditors is also filed for bankruptcy proceedings, as well as for estate adjudication. In the event of bankruptcy, the notice is filed before the first meeting of creditors. This meeting is where creditors gather to make their claims against the defendant.</p>
