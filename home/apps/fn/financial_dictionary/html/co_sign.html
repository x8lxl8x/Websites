<h1>Cosign</h1>

<p>The act of signing for another person's debt which involves a legal obligation made by the cosigner to make payment on the other person's debt should that person default. Having a cosigner is way for individuals with a low income or poor/limited credit history to obtain financing.</p>

<p>This term is also commonly spelled "co-sign".</p>

<p>A cosigner's obligation to repay debt arises only after the borrower has defaulted on the loan; however, cosigning a loan is not without risk. A person cosigning a loan should be comfortable with the borrower's ability to repay the debt.</p>
