<h1>Paid-Up Capital</h1>

<p>The amount of a company's capital that has been funded by shareholders. Paid-up capital can be less than a company's total capital because a company may not issue all of the shares that it has been authorized to sell. Paid-up capital can also reflect how a company depends on equity financing.</p>

<p>Paid-up capital is money that a company has received from the sale of its shares, and represents money that is not borrowed. A company that is fully paid-up has sold all available shares, and thus cannot increase its capital unless it borrows money through debt or is authorized to sell more shares.</p>
