<h1>Personal Income</h1>

<p>Total compensation received by an individual. Personal income includes compensation from a number of sources - salaries, wages and bonuses received from employment or self-employment; dividends and distributions received from investments; rental receipts from real estate investments; profit-sharing from a business and so on. In most jurisdictions, personal income above a certain exemption threshold is subject to taxation. Personal income is generally computed on a pre-tax basis.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "gross income."</p>

<p>Personal income determines consumer consumption, and since consumer spending drives much of the economy, trends in personal income on a quarterly and annual basis are closely tracked by national statistical organizations, economists and analysts.</p>

<p>Personal income tends to display a rising trend during periods of economic expansion, and show a stagnant or slightly declining trend during recessionary times.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, rapid economic growth in economies such as China, India and Brazil has spurred substantial increases in personal incomes for millions of their citizens.</p>
