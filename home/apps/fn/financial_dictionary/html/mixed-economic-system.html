<h1>Mixed Economic System</h1>

<p>An economic system that includes a mixture of capitalism and socialism. This type of economic system includes a combination of private economic freedom and centralized economic planning and government regulation.</p>

<p>There are many countries around the world that are either capitalist or socialist, with countries ranging from the United States to Cuba being referred to as mixed economies. A capitalist system is based on private ownership, labor, personal profit and investments. In contrast, a socialist economy is controlled and regulated publicly, usually through mechanisms like government bodies and planning councils.</p>
