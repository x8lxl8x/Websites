<h1>Alfonso Cortina de Alcocer</h1>

<p>A former president, CEO and chairman of Spanish oil company Repsol YPF. Alcocer's presidency of Repsol was controversial because he did not have a background in the petroleum industry and some believed he partly gained the role through his business and political connections. He left the company in 2004, after which he became president of Inmobiliaria Colonial and then senior advisor at TPG Capital.</p>

<p>Born in 1944 in Madrid, Alcocer earned degrees in economics and industrial engineering and began his career with Banco de Vizcaya Group in 1968. He joined Portland Valderrivas in 1984, where he rose to president, and went to Repsol to become its president, CEO and chairman in 1996. He helped expand the company in Latin America and purchase YPF, an Argentine oil company.</p>
