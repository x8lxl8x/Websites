<h1>Arithmetic Mean</h1>

<p>A mathematical representation of the typical value of a series of numbers, computed as the sum of all the numbers in the series divided by the count of all numbers in the series.</p>

<p>Arithmetic mean is commonly referred to as "average" or simply as "mean".</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to know what the arithmetic mean of a stock's closing price was over the past week. If during the five-day week the stock closed at $14.50, $14.80, $15.20, $15.50, and then $14.00, its arithmetic mean closing price would be equal to the sum of the five numbers ($74.00) divided by five, or $14.80.</p>
