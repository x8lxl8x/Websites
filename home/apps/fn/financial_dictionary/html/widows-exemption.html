<h1>Widow's Exemption</h1>

<p>In general terms, a widow's exemption refers to the amount that can be deducted from taxable income by a widow, thereby reducing her tax burden. In the U.S., it usually refers to the amount exempt from state inheritance taxes on a widow's share of her husband's estate. Since it is claimed as a deduction by the widow, it has the effect of reducing her inheritance taxes.</p>

<p>Less frequently, the term may also apply to the amount of the property tax exemption offered to widows in certain states, such as Florida. A widow would not be eligible for this exemption if she remarries. A similar exemption is also offered to widowers in some other states.</p>
