<h1>Request For Application - RFA</h1>

<p>A type of solicitation notice in which an organization announces that grant funding is available, and allows researchers and other organizations to present bids on how the funding could be used. The Request For Application (RFA) will typically outline what type of programs are eligible, what the expectations are and how applications are submitted and reviewed.</p>

<p>A Request For Application is commonly associated with government agencies and non-profits, as these organizations are more likely than non-governmental agencies to release money in the form of grants. For example, a government agency has earmarked funding for research on green energy. It releases a RFA indicating the guidelines and limitations of the project, how much money is available and the scope of the project (in this case, green energy).</p>
