<h1>Reference Rate</h1>

<p>An interest rate benchmark upon which a floating-rate security or interest rate swap is based.  The reference rate will be a moving index such as LIBOR, the prime rate or the rate on benchmark U.S. Treasuries.</p>

<p>Depending on the security or financial contract being written, the reference rate can be more esoteric, in the form of an inflation benchmark (such as the Consumer Price Index) or a measure of economic health (such as unemployment rates or corporate default rates).</p>

<p>Reference rates are at the core of an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), where the borrower's interest rate will be the reference rate (usually LIBOR) plus a fixed amount, known as the spread. From the point of view of a lender, the reference rate is a guaranteed rate of borrowing, so at minimum the lender always earns the spread as profit.</p>

<p>If the reference rate makes a sudden move upward, borrowers who must pay floating interest rates will see their payments rise dramatically.</p>

<p>When used in an interest rate swap, the floating reference rate is exchanged by one party to the transaction for a fixed interest rate or set of payments.</p>
