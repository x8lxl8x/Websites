<h1>Refunding</h1>

<p>The process of retiring or redeeming an outstanding bond issue at maturity by using the proceeds from a new debt issue. The new issue is almost always issued at a lower rate of interest than the refunded issue, ensuring significant reduction in interest expense for the issuer.</p>

<p>In order to retain the attraction of its debt issues to bond buyers, the issuer will generally ensure that the new issue has at least the same - if not a higher - degree of credit protection as the refunded bonds. Refunding is likely to be more common in a low interest-rate environment, as issuers with significant debt loads have an incentive to replace their maturing higher-cost bonds with cheaper debt.</p>

<p>For example, an issuer that refunds a $100 million bond issue with a 10% coupon at maturity, and replaces it with a new $100 million issue with a 6% coupon, will have savings of $4 million in interest expense per annum.</p>
