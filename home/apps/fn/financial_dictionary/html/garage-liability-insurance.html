<h1>Garage Liability Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance typically purchased by automobile dealerships and repair shops that covers property damage and bodily injury resulting from the operations of an auto garage. It typically does not cover accidents and damage to cars that are brought into the shop, as there is a separate insurance contract for such cases, but it does cover vehicles that are owned by the shop.</p>

<p>Basically, garage liability insurance provides coverage for the day-to-day operations of a garage. Dealership and repair shop owners should consider incorporating their businesses in order to limit personal liability. Without incorporation, an accident that exceeds the garage liability insurance coverage might wind up costing the owner out-of-pocket money.</p>
