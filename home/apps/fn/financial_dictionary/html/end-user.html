<h1>End-User</h1>

<p>The true consumer of a product or service. The term "end-user" is used to distinguish the person who will actually work with the good or service from individuals who are involved in other stages of its development, production and distribution.</p>

<p>In order to create a successful product or service, the people who create, develop, test and market it must think not of their own needs, but of the end-user's. For example, a computer programmer designing forex trading software would need to think about the level of computer knowledge and forex knowledge the end user will have (among other considerations) in order to design software that will accommodate the end-user's existing knowledge, ability and needs.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has also used the term "end-user" to refer to consumers of investment products.</p>
