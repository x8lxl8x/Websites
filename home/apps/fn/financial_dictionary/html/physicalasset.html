<h1>Physical Asset</h1>

<p>An item of economic, commercial or exchange value that has a tangible or material existence. For most businesses, physical assets usually refer to cash, equipment, inventory and properties owned by the business. Physical assets are the opposite of intangible assets, which are non-physical assets such as leases, computer programs or agreements.</p>

<p>Usually, this term refers to things that may be liquidated from a business in the event of default in order to pay off debts. For example, physical assets found in a restaurant, for example, are chairs, tables, refrigerators and food. Although some physical assets can be inventoried or stored, they may go through depletion, depreciation, deterioration or shrinkage in the storage process.</p>
