<h1>SEC Form SB-1</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is required to be used by issuers with revenues (and public market float) of less than $25 million. SEC Form SB-1 registers offerings of up to $10 million of securities, as long as the company has not registered more than $10 million in offerings during the previous 12 months and current outstanding securities do not total more than $25 million. This form is a simplified version, which requires less detailed information (such as less detailed financial statements, and omission of summary data) about the issuer's business than SEC Form S-1.</p>

<p>Form SB-1 is also known as the Registration Statement for Securities to be Sold to the Public by Certain Small Business Issuers, and is filed under the Securities Act of 1933. This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
