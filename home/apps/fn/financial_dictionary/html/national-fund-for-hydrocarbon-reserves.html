<h1>National Fund For Hydrocarbon Reserves (Mauritania)</h1>

<p>A sovereign wealth fund administered by the Banque Centrale de Mauritanie, the central bank of Mauritania. The National Fund for Hydrocarbon Reserves is funded by revenues that the government receives from companies extracting oil, royalties and taxes that oil companies must pay in order to operate in Mauritania, and from the profits made through the fund's investment activities.</p>

<p>The National Fund for Hydrocarbon Reserves was established in 2006, and seeks to create macroeconomic stability by setting aside oil and gas revenue for developmental projects. The fund's management practices are considered less transparent than those of other sovereign wealth funds.</p>
