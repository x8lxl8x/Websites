<h1>Accident And Sickness Insurance Act</h1>

<p>This is a Canadian government statute that defines the acceptable terms and conditions of  health insurance coverage and sets out guidelines to which these policies must conform. It is now known as the Uniform Accident and Sickness Insurance Act, which is the model law adopted by the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR). The model legislation has been enacted, with minor variations, by all Canadian provinces.</p>

<p>In Canada's extremely competitive life and health insurance market, the enactment of national laws and the ability to establish uniform standards agreed-to by all the provincial governments was a feat of great magnitude. It serves as a model for other nations with decentralized standards and licensing requirements.</p>
