<h1>Growth Stock</h1>

<p>Shares in a company whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market.</p>

<p>Also known as a "glamor stock".</p>

<p>A growth stock usually does not pay a dividend, as the company would prefer to reinvest retained earnings in capital projects. Most technology companies are growth stocks.</p>

<p>Note that a growth company's stock is not always classified as growth stock. In fact, a growth company's stock is often overvalued.</p>
