<h1>Industrial Revolution</h1>

<p>A period of major industrialization that took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Industrial Revolution, beginning in Great Britain, quickly spread throughout the world. This time period saw the mechanization of agriculture and textile manufacturing and a revolution in power (i.e., steam ships and railroads) and had a massive effect on social, cultural and economic conditions.</p>

<p>It has been argued that the factory systems developed during the Industrial Revolution are responsible for the modern cities we know today. During the Industrial Revolution, workers came to cities in droves to look for employment in the new factories. Because the industrial system was new, there were no experienced workers, and thus everyone had an opportunity to find employment. Technological advancement followed, which increased overall production.</p>
