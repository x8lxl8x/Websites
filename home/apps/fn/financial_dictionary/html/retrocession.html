<h1>Retrocession</h1>

<p>1. The practice of one reinsurance company essentially insuring another reinsurance company by accepting business that the other company had agreed to underwrite.</p>

<p>2. The voluntary act of returning ceded property from one group to another. Retrocession can also be the result of a request to have property returned but, by definition, is not the result of a forced transaction.</p>

<p>3. The process of differentiating or diversifying assets by consolidating and then subdividing them amongst a number of stakeholders.</p>

<p>1. When one reinsurance company has other reinsurance companies partially underwrite some of its reinsurance risk, it essentially diversifies its risk portfolio and limits its potential losses as a result of a catastrophe. For example, if a hurricane causes widespread damage to businesses, homes, automobiles and lives, a single insurer could face bankruptcy without retrocession.</p>

<p>2. The best known international act of retrocession is when Hong Kong was given back to the Chinese from the British in 1997.</p>

<p>3. Hedge funds often buy very valuable single assets and divide them on a pro-rata basis amongst partnership unitholders. Just as risk and liabilities can be retroceded, so can assets.</p>
