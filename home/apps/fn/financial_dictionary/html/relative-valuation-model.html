<h1>Relative Valuation Model</h1>

<p>A business valuation method that compares a firm's value to that of its competitors to determine the firm's financial worth. Relative valuation models are an alternative to absolute value models, which try to determine a company's intrinsic worth based on its estimated future free cash flows discounted to their present value. Like absolute value models, investors may use relative valuation models when determining whether a company's stock is a good buy.</p>

<p>Relative valuation is not as straightforward as it might appear on the surface. Which companies are chosen as comparable companies and which multiples are used to determine value will have a significant outcome on a company's relative valuation. When performing a relative valuation, a company's sector should be used to determine the most logical multiple to use. For example, price to cash flow for real estate and price to sales for retail.</p>
