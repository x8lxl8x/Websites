<h1>Below The Line Advertising</h1>

<p>In general, an advertising strategy in which a product is promoted in mediums other than radio, television, billboards, print, film and the internet. Types of below the line advertising commonly include direct mail campaigns, trade shows and catalogs; this advertising type tends to be less expensive and more focused.</p>

<p>Below the line advertising seeks to reach a consumer (instead of a mass audience) directly rather than through an intermediary, such as would be the case with a commercial during a television show. This type of advertising is often centered on specific localities and is used to promote products that a consumer will want to see in person. It can be coupled with in-store sales help in order to explain the features of the product.</p>
