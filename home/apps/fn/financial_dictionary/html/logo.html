<h1>Logo</h1>

<p>A graphical mark used to identify a company, organization, product or brand. Logos can be displayed along side - or in lieu of -  a company's name in order to generate awareness of the company's association with a particular product or service. The particular graphic used may be a stylized version of the company lettering (such as a wordmark) or abstract (such as a shape unrelated to the company lettering).</p>

<p>Logos are an example of intangible assets because they hold value, but not in a physical form. Logos have become an integral part of a company's identity, and are used heavily in the marketing of products and services. A well-recognized logo can increase a company's goodwill, and is trademarked for intellectual property protection.</p>

<p>Historically, pictures were used to convey messages to individuals who were unable to read. A picture of a loaf of bread would be used on a sign to denote a baker. Even if the word "bread" was not displayed, consumers knew the type of product available at that store.</p>
