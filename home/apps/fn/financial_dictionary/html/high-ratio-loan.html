<h1>High Ratio Loan</h1>

<p>A loan of any type for which a relatively small down payment must be made. For mortgages, a high value loan usually covers more than 80% of the property's value. Most high ratio home loans require some form of insurance coverage in order to protect the lender.</p>

<p>High ratio home loans allow lower income and asset buyers to purchase homes with relatively little cash on hand. The wisdom of this business practice has been called into question during the mortgage crisis of 2008. High ratio loans generally charge higher rates than lower ratio loans.</p>
