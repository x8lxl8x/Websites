<h1>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h1>

<p>In an insurance sense, a number of disparate processes used by insurance companies to resolve claim and contractual disputes. Insured clients who are denied a claim are offered this course of action as a form of recourse. Alternative dispute resolution is employed to avoid expensive and time-consuming litigation and arbitration.</p>

<p>Alternative dispute resolution can take many forms. Examples of this type of resolution are non-binding arbitration and simple, direct negotiation between the insured and the carrier. In some cases, a neutral third party can be brought in to act as a mediator, if necessary.</p>
