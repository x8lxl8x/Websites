<h1>Average Outstanding Balance</h1>

<p>The unpaid, interest-bearing balance of a loan or loan portfolio averaged over a period of time, usually one month. The average outstanding balance refers to any term, instalment, revolving or credit card debt on which interest is charged.</p>

<p>The average outstanding balance on credit cards and loans is a critical factor in a consumer's credit rating. Average outstanding balances on credit cards are reported to credit agencies monthly on active accounts, along with any amounts that are past due.</p>
