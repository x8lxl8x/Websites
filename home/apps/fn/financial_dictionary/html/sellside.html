<h1>Sell Side</h1>

<p>The part of the financial industry involved with the creation, promotion, analysis and sale of securities. Sell-side individuals and firms work to create and service stock products that will be made available to the buy side of the financial industry. The sell side of Wall Street includes investment bankers who serve as intermediaries between issuers of securities and the investing public, analysts who perform stock research and make ratings, and the market makers who provide liquidity in the market.</p>

<p>The sell side and buy side of Wall Street are dependent upon each other - one could not operate without the other. The sell side tries to get the highest price possible for each security while providing service and support in the form of analysis and ratings. Any individual or firm that purchases stock with the objective of selling it later at a profit is from the buy side. The buy-side players include money managers at hedge funds, institutional firms, mutual funds and pension funds. Despite the fact the individual investors are technically on the buy side, the term is usually reserved for professional money managers.</p>
