<h1>Deferred Profit Sharing Plan - DPSP</h1>

<p>An employer-sponsored Canadian profit sharing plan that is registered with the Canadian Revenue Agency. On a periodic basis, the employer shares the profits made from the business with all employees or a designated group of employees. Employees receiving a share of the profits paid out by the employer do not have to pay federal taxes on the money received from the DPSP until it is withdrawn.</p>

<p>An employer that chooses to participate in a DPSP with some or all of its employees is referred to as the sponsor of the plan. Employees who are granted a share of the profits are the trustees of the plan. DPSPs are a type of pension.</p>
