<h1>Building Permits</h1>

<p>A type of authorization that must be granted by a government or other regulatory body before  the construction of a new or existing building can legally occur. The U.S. census bureau reports the finalized number of the total monthly building permits on the 18th work day of every month.</p>

<p>The monthly building permit report is closely watched by economists and investors alike. Since all related factors associated with the construction of a building are important economic activities (for example, financing and employment), the building permit report can give a major hint as to the state of the economy in the near future.</p>
