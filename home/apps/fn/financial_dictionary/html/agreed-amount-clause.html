<h1>Agreed Amount Clause</h1>

<p>A property insurance provision in which the insurer agrees to waive the co-insurance requirement. To obtain an agreed amount clause, insurers require a statement of property values signed by the insured as a condition of activating or including an agreed value provision in a commercial property policy, otherwise known as an agreed amount clause.</p>

<p>The coinsurance clause requires the insured to have a certain percent of the property value insured, and often provides the insured a substantial reduction in rate, provided he or she maintains insurance equal to the amount agreed upon at the inception of the policy.</p>
