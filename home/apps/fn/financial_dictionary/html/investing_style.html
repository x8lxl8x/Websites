<h1>Investment Style</h1>

<p>The overarching strategy or theory used by either a retail investor or an institutional money manager to set asset allocation and choose individual securities for investment. The investment style of a fund helps set expectations for long-term performance potential and aids in advertising the fund to investors looking for a specific type of market exposure.</p>

<p>Most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) employ a consistent investment style. An investment style can be broadly drawn, such as "international bonds", or finely tuned, such as "mid-cap value stocks that pay steady income".</p>

<p>With the majority of mutual funds and ETFs, managers are limited by their prospectus as to what kind of securities they may own. The portfolio managers of a healthcare fund, for example, must be invested in only healthcare-related companies, even if they don't feel the sector is a good place to be.</p>

<p>No one investment style is inherently better than another; the key is to find a style that suits an investor's appetite for risk while remaining a sufficient level of diversification.</p>
