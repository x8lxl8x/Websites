<h1>Guilder Share - New York Share</h1>

<p>An ownership stake in a Dutch company that can be traded in the United States because it represents shares that have been canceled in Dutch markets. Guilder Shares, also called New York Shares, represent a special international trading arrangement for shares of Dutch companies only, since the stocks of Dutch companies can't be traded through American depository receipts (ADR).</p>

<p>When buying shares of a company located in a foreign country, U.S. citizens will generally buy an ADR, a certificate that represents those foreign shares. Since the Netherlands do not allow Dutch company stock to be traded in other countries, a certain number of shares must be canceled in the Netherlands then grouped and sold as Guilder Shares that can then be issued in the U.S.</p>

<p>The guilder was also once the name of a Dutch currency.</p>
