<h1>Mosaic Theory</h1>

<p>A method of analysis used by security analysts to gather information about a corporation. Mosaic theory involves collecting public, non-public and non-material information about a company in order to determine the underlying value of the company's securities and to enable the analyst to make recommendations to clients based on that information.
Some see this style of analysis as a misuse of insider information, but the CFA Institute (formerly known as AIMR) has recognized mosaic theory as a valid method of analysis. However, analysts using this method should disclose the details of the information and methodology they used to arrive at their recommendation.           </p>
