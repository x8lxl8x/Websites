<h1>Fair Trade Investing</h1>

<p>Investing in companies or projects that promote fair trade with producers in developing nations. Basic fair trade philosophies call for equal pay for suppliers of raw goods and materials as well as respect for strong environmental practices and a focus on the trading relationships between advanced economies and developing nations.</p>

<p>Fair trade investing mainly deals with trade in agricultural products, such as coffee, sugar and textiles. Many of the growers of these products are low-income workers who are often marginalized in trade agreements and receive few subsidies from their home governments. Fair trade practices aim to help these workers gain a higher standard of living and financial independence, while the companies who actively promote fair trade can show transparency in their business dealings and gain valuable image points with shareholders.</p>
