<h1>Underbanked</h1>

<p>A situation where an underwriter of a new securities issue has been unsuccessful in getting other firms to become members of the underwriting group or syndicate. As a result, the security will not be sold to as many clients as had been desired.</p>

<p>Underbanked can also refer to an individual or business that heavily relies on checks and cash as a mean of funding rather than bank related methods such as credit cards or loans.</p>

<p>An investment banker is underbanked when he or she is facing challenges in acquiring additional members for the underwriting group or syndicate for a new securities issue. If the originating investment banker is unable to find enough firms, he or she may not be able to underwrite the issue - and therefore would be unable to offer the security for sale.</p>
