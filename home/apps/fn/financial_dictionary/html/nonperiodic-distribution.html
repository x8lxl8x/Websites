<h1>Nonperiodic Distribution</h1>

<p>A type of employee retirement-plan distribution that is not considered a periodic distribution. Periodic distributions would include monthly payments, while nonperiodic payments would be one-time lump-sum payments.</p>

<p>Nonperiodic distributions that are paid directly to the employee will be subject to a 10% withholding tax unless the beneficiary elects to have no taxes withheld.</p>

<p>Nonperiodic distributions do not include IRA transfers and/or rollovers, systematic withdrawals or required minimum distributions. Only taxable distributions that are taken in cash are subject to the withholding tax.</p>

<p>The withholding rule is intended to discourage employees from raiding their retirement assets before they are retired.</p>
