<h1>Soft Inquiry</h1>

<p>A credit report check that does not affect an individual's credit score. A soft inquiry, also called a soft pull, occurs when an individual checks his or her own credit report, which she might do to make sure it contains no errors or fraudulent activity or to check her score before applying for a major loan like a mortgage. Credit checks by employers are also treated as soft inquiries and do not affect an individual's credit score.</p>

<p>There are two types of credit report inquiries: hard and soft: Hard inquiries, also called hard pulls, occur when an individual applies for credit by filling out a credit card application, applying for a mortgage, applying for an auto loan or any number of other activities. Several of these types of inquiries can sometimes temporarily lower an individual's credit score because the credit bureaus see a consumer's recent applications for new credit as a potential risk factor.</p>
