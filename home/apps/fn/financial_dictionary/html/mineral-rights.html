<h1>Mineral Rights</h1>

<p>A landowner's right to receive a portion of the profits of any minerals that are extracted from the land. Mineral rights apply to all types of resources, such as oil and gas, ores and metals or other raw materials. The term mineral rights describes the numerous beneficial ways the owner can profit from the resources in the ground.</p>

<p>Mineral rights give the landowner the right to sell or profit from minerals extracted from the ground in several ways. They can be sold, developed or leased, depending upon the landowner's needs and desires. Many landowners allow oil or other mineral companies to extract the mineral from the ground in return for the royalty income from the revenue.</p>
