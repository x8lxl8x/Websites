<h1>Nonprofit Marketing</h1>

<p>Activities and strategies employed by a nonprofit organization that are designed to spread the message of the organization, as well as to solicit donations and call for volunteers. Nonprofit marketing involves the creation of logos, slogans and copy, as well as the development of a media campaign to expose the organization to an outside audience.</p>

<p>A nonprofit organization can approach marketing in the same way as a for-profit business. It should identify its target market (the one it wants to reach), develop marketing materials to send to that target market, and determine the objectives that a marketing campaign should meet. In this sense, the nonprofit organization follows the four P's of marketing: product, place, price and promotion.</p>
