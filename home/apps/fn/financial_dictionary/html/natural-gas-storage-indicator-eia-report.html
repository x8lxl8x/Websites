<h1>Natural Gas Storage Indicator - EIA Report</h1>

<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly estimate of working natural gas volumes held in underground storage facilities at the national and regional levels. Changes in these gas inventories on a weekly basis primarily reflect net withdrawals or injections. The report is generally reported every Thursday at 10:30am EST. Unexpected changes such as above-average withdrawals or injections can have an immediate impact on natural gas prices.</p>

<p>Working gas, the volume of gas in a reservoir that is above the level of base gas, is the amount of gas that is available to the marketplace.
The EIA report shows gas inventories for the reporting week and previous week, as well as the net change, on a national basis and for East, West and Producing regions. It also provides inventories for a year ago and the five-year average for historical comparison.</p>
