<h1>Michael Eisner</h1>

<p>A former CEO of Walt Disney from 1984 to 2005. Michael Eisner was initially extremely successful in this role: he oversaw the production of numerous blockbuster films, helped the company diversify, saw its stock price rise and helped increase annual revenues by $7 billion.</p>

<p>Starting in the mid-to-late 1990s, the company suffered financially and Eisner faced increasing criticism for his management style and decision making. Because of his falling popularity, he was not re-elected as chairman in 2004 and he stepped down as CEO and director in 2005.</p>

<p>Born in 1942 in New York State, Eisner earned his BA in 1964 from Denison University. He began his media career as a page for NBC in 1963, and also worked briefly at CBS before beginning a long career with ABC in 1966 as assistant to the national programming director.</p>

<p>He worked his way up to senior vice president for prime-time production and development over the next 10 years, then joined Paramount Pictures as its president and CEO before going to Walt Disney as its chairman and CEO in 1984, a position he would hold for 20 years. He also established the Los Angeles-based Eisner Foundation in 1996 to help disadvantaged children and the elderly.</p>
