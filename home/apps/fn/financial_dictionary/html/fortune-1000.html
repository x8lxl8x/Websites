<h1>Fortune 1000</h1>

<p>A list created by <i>Fortune</i> magazine detailing the 1,000 largest companies in the United States. The Fortune 1000 is based on revenues, rather than other metrics of size, such as market cap or enterprise value. Since revenues are the basis for inclusion on the list, only companies that make revenue figures publicly available are eligible for inclusion in the list.</p>

<p>Although less widely mentioned than its subset, the Fortune 500, the Fortune 1000 is still considered an important and prestigious list. Its annual publishing brings great interest in the business community because those who follow the business world are interested in which companies are included in the list along with their position relative to similar companies.</p>
