<h1>Belt And Suspenders</h1>

<p>A term used to mean conservatism and safety in lending practices. Belt and suspenders has been used to describe cautious bankers who demand loan policies be very strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>More generally - as the use of both a belt <i>and</i> suspenders to hold up one's pants implies - it can mean having redundant safety procedures in place to eliminate all risk. The term can be complimentary, but it also can convey ridicule of the overly conservative.</p>

<p>In his book <i>The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time </i>(2004), William Safire cited several examples of the use of belt and suspenders. He notes a sentence in the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> from 1987: "To qualify for the Scott Burns Belts and Suspender Bank List, a bank had to have primary equity capital amounting to at least 10% of its assets."</p>

<p>He also mentions a piece from the <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>in which Clinton policymaker Robert Rubin says "We'll be belts and suspenders with respect to those," regarding restrictions about lobbying the White House upon assuming his new banking job.</p>
