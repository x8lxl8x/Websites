<h1>Medicare Hold Harmless Provision</h1>

<p>A legal statement prohibiting an increase to Medicare B premiums for the vast majority of American citizens. The Medicare hold harmless provision ensures that Medicare B premiums can not rise more than the previous year's cost of living increase in Social Security benefits.</p>

<p>The beneficiaries who are not protected from rising premiums by the hold harmless provision will likely see their part B premiums rise, since they (A) Did not have part B premiums deducted for their Social Security distributions, (B) paid a higher part B premium surcharge based on their higher income or (C) were newly enrolled in Medicare part B.</p>
