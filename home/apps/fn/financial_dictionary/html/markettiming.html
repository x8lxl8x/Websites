<h1>Market Timing</h1>

<p>1. The act of attempting to predict the future direction of the market, typically through the use of technical indicators or economic data.</p>

<p>2. The practice of switching among mutual fund asset classes in an attempt to profit from the changes in their market outlook.</p>

<p>Some investors, especially academics, believe it is impossible to time the market. Other investors, notably active traders, believe strongly in market timing. Thus, whether market timing is possible is really a matter of opinion.</p>

<p>What we can say with certainty is that it's very difficult to be successful at market timing continuously over the long-run. For the average investor who doesn't have the time (or desire) to watch the market on a daily basis, there are good reasons to avoid market timing and focus on investing for the long-run.</p>
