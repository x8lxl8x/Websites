<h1>SEC Form S-3D</h1>

<p>A filing that publicly-traded companies must submit to the SEC's EDGAR system when they purchase securities on behalf of shareholders as a result of a dividend or interest reinvestment plan. A Company will often propose a dividend or interest reinvestment plan as a convenient and economical way for shareholders to purchase additional shares of its common stock by using the interest and/or dividends they have earned on their existing shares of common stock.</p>

<p>Shareholders typically do not have to pay brokerage fees, commissions or service charges when a company makes a dividend or interest reinvestment. Companies may also offer shareholders the opportunity to purchase an additional amount of common shares by cash payment in addition to their dividend or interest reinvestment.</p>

<p>Requirements for filing the S-3D forms are covered under rule 462 of the Securities Act of 1933.</p>
