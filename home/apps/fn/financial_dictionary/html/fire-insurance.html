<h1>Fire Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance that is used to cover damage to a property caused by fire. Fire insurance is a specialized form of insurance beyond property insurance, and is designed to cover the cost of replacement, reconstruction or repair beyond what is covered by the property insurance policy. Policies cover damage to the building itself, and may also cover damage to nearby structures, personal property and expenses associated with not being able to live in or use the property if it is damaged.</p>

<p>Homeowners and property owners may consider fire insurance in addition to a property insurance policy if the property contains valuable items. A best practice would be to document the property and its related contents, which makes identifying the value of items damaged or lost much easier after a fire has taken place. A fire insurance policy may contain exclusions based on the cause of the fire, such as not covering fires caused by wars.</p>
