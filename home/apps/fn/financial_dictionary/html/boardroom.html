<h1>Boardroom</h1>

<p>Besides the general definition as a meeting room in an office, in the investment community the boardroom can refer more specifically to a room used in a stockbrokerage office. The boardroom is where clients and members of the public can meet with registered representatives. They meet here to discuss investments, obtain stock quotes and place trades.</p>

<p>Board rooms usually have the latest techological equipment, such as Bloomberg terminals or other state-of-the-art quotation systems. The boardrooms at larger firms often also have large-screen TVs and other multimedia sources of business news. Some firms do not use these rooms at all, but allow clients to meet with brokers in their individual offices.</p>
