<h1>Revenue Regulation Fund</h1>

<p>The Revenue Regulation Fund is a sovereign wealth fund for the nation of Algeria. The sovereign wealth fund originates from surplus revenues gained from taxes on the development of Algeria's oil and gas reserves. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the Revenue Regulation Fund has approximately $54.8 billion in assets under management as of 2009.</p>

<p>The Revenue Regulation Fund was established in 2000 primarily to act as a stabilization fund to lessen the impact that volatility in oil and gas prices have on the Government of Algeria. The Revenue Regulation Fund is a secretive organization and little information can be found as to its governance, holdings or investment strategies.</p>
