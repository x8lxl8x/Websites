<h1>PDCA Cycle</h1>

<p>A four-step problem-solving iterative technique used to improve business processes. The four steps are plan-do-check-act. The PDCA Cycle can be used to effect both major performance breakthroughs as well as small incremental improvements in projects and processes. Also known as the Deming wheel or Shewhart cycle.</p>

<p>The concept was originally developed by statistician Walter Shewhart during the 1930s. It was subsequently popularized by quality control pioneer Dr. W. Edwards Deming in the 1950s.</p>
