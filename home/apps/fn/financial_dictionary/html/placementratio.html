The placement ratio is used by investors as an indicator of the overall situation of the municipal bond market. The higher the placement ratio, the better off the municipal bond market is. The data for bonds sold and issued during the week is compiled and published weekly by the market newspaper, "The Bond Buyer".           </p>
