<h1>Voting Trust</h1>

<p>A legal trust created to combine the voting power of shareholders. With the establishment of the voting trust, the shareholders' legal title (their stock) and voting rights are transferred to a designated trustee for a set duration.</p>

<p>There are many reasons stockholders may wish to form these trusts. For example, they may create one in the hopes of maintaining control within a corporation through a unified vote. Or they may want to use it as a form of protection from corporate creditors. The laws of different states usually have limitations on the duration of a trust, as it is a legally binding agreement.</p>
