<h1>Franchisee</h1>

<p>The party in a franchising agreement that is purchasing the right to use a business's trademarks, associated brands and other proprietary knowledge in order to open a branch. In addition to paying an annual franchising fee to the underlying company, the franchisee must also pay a portion of its profits to the franchisor.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of being a franchisee is that the franchisor provides all the information that is needed for running the business (such as, training and suppliers). Furthermore, a franchisee is also usually given an exclusive area, where no other franchises belong to the same underlying business can set up shop in order to prevent internal competition.</p>
