<h1>Brokerage Department</h1>

<p>A department within an insurance company whose agents specialized in obtaining insurance for difficult-to-insure customers through alternate insurance markets or by obtaining insurance at a more favorable rate than such a customer could find on his or her own. Examples include a smoker who wants to buy life insurance, someone who has had heart surgery and wants to purchase an individual health insurance policy and other high-risk or unusual situations.</p>

<p>Whereas customers who can easily meet insurers' underwriting criteria may obtain insurance directly from an insurance company without the assistance of an agent, for high-risk customers an agent in the brokerage department will analyze the client's needs, research and review the available insurance options, make recommendations and secure the policy for the client.</p>
