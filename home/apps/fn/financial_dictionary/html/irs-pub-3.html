<h1>IRS Publication 3 - Armed Forces' Tax Guide</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service that outlines special tax considerations for active members of the United States military. It is part of a series of publications explaining how the IRS conducts business. IRS Publication 3 covers both regular and reserve personnel directed by the Secretaries of Defenses, Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the Coast Guard. Neither the Red Cross nor Merchant Marines are included.</p>

<p>Members of the military receive several different types of allowances and pay, such as Combat Zone Exclusions, which are not treated as normal income. IRS Publication 3 outlines which items are subject to taxation. It does not cover benefits extended to veterans or military pensions. Those are covered in IRS Publication 525.</p>
