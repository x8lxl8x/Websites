<h1>Kicking The Tires</h1>

<p>A slang term for researching an investment before putting any money into it. The process of kicking the tires for a stock might include reading the company's annual report, examining the company's management, looking at its historical performance, considering the company's competitors and reading news articles about the company.</p>

<p>The steps involved in kicking the tires depend somewhat on the type of investment. Someone considering putting money in a hedge fund would want to research the hedge fund manager first, while someone considering putting money in a CD would want to research interest rates available at different banks and make sure their investment would be FDIC-insured.</p>
