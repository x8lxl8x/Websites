<h1>Term Fed Funds</h1>

<p>Funds that banks borrow from the Federal Reserve for longer than a day, but generally less than 90 days. As a general rule, banks borrow term Fed funds when they need a temporary influx of cash, but still wish to benefit from a low interest rate.</p>

<p>Because they are held for longer than the customary 24 hours, term Fed funds sometimes have higher interest rates than those held for shorter periods of time, though that rate is still much lower than an individual borrower could receive.</p>
