<h1>Stochastic Oscillator</h1>

<p>A technical momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. The oscillator's sensitivity to market movements can be reduced by adjusting the time period or by taking a moving average of the result. This indicator is calculated with the following formula:</p>

<p><b>%K = 100[(C - L14)/(H14 - L14)]</b></p>

<p>C = the most recent closing price
L14 = the low of the 14 previous trading sessions
H14 = the highest price traded during the same 14-day period.</p>

<p>%D = 3-period moving average of %K</p>

<p>The theory behind this indicator is that in an upward-trending market, prices tend to close near their high, and during a downward-trending market, prices tend to close near their low. Transaction signals occur when the %K crosses through a three-period moving average called the "%D".</p>
