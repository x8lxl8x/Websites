<h1>Profit Motive</h1>

<p>The intent to achieve monetary gain in a transaction or material endeavor. Profit motive can also be construed as the underlying reason why a taxpayer or company participates in business activities of any kind. Profit motive must be determined for some transactions to determine the deductibility of any expenses involved.</p>

<p>For taxpayers who participate in rental activities, profit motive must be determined in order to claim rental expenses. The IRS may try to prevent a taxpayer from claiming rental losses if a profit motive cannot be proved. Profit motive can be established by proving that a profit was realized in at least three out of the last five years. Profit motive is also what separates a hobby from a business in the eyes of the IRS; hobby losses are nondeductible because there was no intent to make a profit from any gains.</p>
