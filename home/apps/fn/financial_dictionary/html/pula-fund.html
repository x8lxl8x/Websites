<h1>Pula Fund</h1>

<p>The Pula Fund is a sovereign wealth fund established in 1994 by the Republic of Botswana, an African nation with a rapidly growing economy and large diamond and mineral reserves. It was established with the objective of preserving part of the income from diamond exports for Botswana's future generations.</p>

<p>The Pula Fund is managed as a long-term investment portfolio by the Bank of Botswana, and is funded by foreign exchange reserves that exceed the nation's medium-term requirements. It invests in public equity and fixed income instruments in industrialized economies. The Pula Fund had assets in excess of $6 billion as of February 2010.</p>
