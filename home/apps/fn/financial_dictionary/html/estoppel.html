<h1>Estoppel</h1>

<p>A legal defense tool used when someone reneges on or contradicts a previous agreement or claim. Estoppel prevents someone from arguing something contrary to a claim made or act performed by that person previously. Conceptually, estoppel is meant to prevent people from being unjustly wronged by the inconsistencies of another person's words or actions.</p>

<p>There are many different types of estoppel. Two common forms are equitable estoppel, which can prevent a person from going back on his word, and collateral estoppel, which can prevent a person from going back to court on the same grievance. Collateral estoppel is used to prevent legal harassment and abuse of legal resources.</p>

<p>For example, if a mother states that a child is not hers, estoppel could prevent her from later trying to claim child support payments from the child's father.</p>
