<h1>Windstorm Insurance</h1>

<p>A special type of property-casualty insurance that protects policyholders from property damage caused by windstorms. Windstorm insurance is usually offered in the form of a rider on a standard casualty insurance policy through the extended coverage endorsement. It is one of the subsets of storm insurance.</p>

<p>Most types of windstorms, such as hurricanes and cyclones, are not typically covered in standard homeowners' insurance policies. Those who live in areas susceptible to this type of peril must therefore purchase this additional coverage in order to protect themselves. Residents of coastal states and midwestern states where tornadoes are common fall into this category.</p>
