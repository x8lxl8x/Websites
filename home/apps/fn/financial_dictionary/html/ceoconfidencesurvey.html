<h1>CEO Confidence Survey</h1>

<p>A monthly survey of 100 CEOs from a variety of industries in the U.S. economy. The survey is conducted, analyzed and reported by the Conference Board, and it seeks to gauge the economic outlook of CEOs, determining their concerns for their businesses, and their view on where the economy is headed. A reading above 50 indicates that the CEOs surveyed are more bullish than bearish on their economic outlook.</p>

<p>The CEO Confidence Survey researches CEOs' views on obstacles to hiring new workers, reasons for layoffs, concerns about their industry and the economy, including their short-term and long-term economic outlooks. CEOs are regarded as people who have the power to make large investment decisions that can impact the economy as a whole. This is why the CEO Confidence Survey can provide investors and traders with valuable insight into economic conditions.</p>
