<h1>Grey Market</h1>

<p>1. A market where a product is bought and sold outside of the manufacturer's authorized trading channels.</p>

<p>2. The unofficial trading of a company's shares, usually before they are issued in an initial public offering (IPO).</p>

<p>1. For example, if a store owner is an unauthorized dealer of a certain high-end electronics brand, the product is considered to be sold in the grey market. If the product is illegal, it would be selling on the "black market".</p>

<p>2. The grey market is an over-the-counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued. This activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the IPO.</p>
