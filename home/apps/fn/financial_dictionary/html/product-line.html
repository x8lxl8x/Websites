<h1>Product Line</h1>

<p>A group of related products manufactured by a single company. For example, a cosmetic company's makeup product line might include foundation, concealer, powder, blush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick products that are all closely related. The same company might also offer more than one product line. The cosmetic company might have a special product line geared toward teenagers and another line geared toward women older than 60, in addition to its regular product line, that can be used by women of any age.</p>

<p>A good way for a company to try to expand its business is by adding to its existing product line. This is because people are more likely to purchase products from brands with which they are already familiar. For example, a frozen pizza company may wanted to increase its market share by adding frozen breadsticks and frozen pastas to its product line.</p>
