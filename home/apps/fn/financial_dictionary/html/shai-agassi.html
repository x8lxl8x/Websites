<h1>Shai Agassi</h1>

<p>Shai Agassi is an Israeli entrepreneur living in California. Agassi founded TopTier Software in 1992, and is the former president of the products and technology group of SAP AG, a business management software company. He resigned from SAP in 2007 to become the founder and CEO of Better Pace, an electric vehicle company aiming to reduce the world's dependence on oil.</p>

<p>Agassi's company has worked with Nissan to create the first emission-free electric vehicle. His vision is to remove the hassles associated with electric vehicles (such as recharging them) and make them less expensive to operate than gasoline-powered vehicles. He also wants to make Israel the first country in the world to use only electric cars. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of 2009.</p>
