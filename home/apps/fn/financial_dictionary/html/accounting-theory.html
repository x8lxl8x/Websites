<h1>Accounting Theory</h1>

<p>Assumptions, methodologies and frameworks used in the study and application of financial principles. The study of accounting theory involves a review of both the historical foundations of accounting practices, as well as the way in which accounting practices are verified and added to the regulatory framework that governs financial statements and financial reporting.</p>

<p>Accounting as a discipline has existed since the 15th Century. Since then both businesses and economies have greatly evolved. Accounting theory is a continuously-evolving subject, as it must adapt to new ways of doing business, new technological standards and gaps that are discovered in reporting mechanisms. Organizations such as the International Accounting Standards Board help create practical applications of accounting theory, and professionals such as CPAs help companies navigate accounting standards.</p>
