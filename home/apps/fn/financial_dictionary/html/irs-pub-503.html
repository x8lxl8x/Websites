<h1>IRS Publication 503: Child And Dependent Care Expenses</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service that outlines the criteria which must be met in order for a taxpayer to deduct expenses for the care of children and dependents.

<p>In order to claim tax credits for children or dependents, certain criteria must be met: the persons claimed must be qualified, the taxpayer must have worked at some point during the year, expenses must be incurred so that the taxpayer could work or look for work, and care payments must be made to a non-dependent.</p>
