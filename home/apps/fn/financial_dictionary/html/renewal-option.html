<h1>Renewal Option</h1>

<p>A clause in a lease that outlines the terms for renewing or extending an original lease agreement. The renewal option appears as a covenant in the original lease and provides specifications under which the leaseholder can renew or extend the original lease term for an additional, specified time and rate (rent).</p>

<p>A renewal option provides the leaseholder the option, but not the obligation, to renew or extend a lease agreement beyond its initial terms. A start-up business may, for example, rent an office space for five years. A renewal option would allow the business to renew or extend the lease to remain in the office space beyond the five-year lease term. This can be beneficial to the business: if it is doing well in the location, it can remain for an additional term; if it is doing poorly, it can close shop at the end of the initial term without defaulting on the lease and without pressure to renew or extend it.</p>
