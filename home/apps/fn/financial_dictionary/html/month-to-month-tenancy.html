<h1>Month-To-Month Tenancy</h1>

<p>A type of rental agreement. Month-to-month tenancy is based upon the idea that the lease is renewed at the end of each month. If the renter decides to leave at the end of the month, then he/she/they may do so without breaking the lease.</p>

<p>In a month-to-month tenancy, a renter can live in a dwelling as long as he or she wishes provided the rent is paid on time and the landlord does not give prior notice of vacancy. Of course, the renter can also cancel the lease at any time with notice. Basically, the renter can stay until either the renter or the landlord decides differently. These shorter term leases are much more flexible for renters, especially if they do not know how long they will stay in a particular place.</p>
