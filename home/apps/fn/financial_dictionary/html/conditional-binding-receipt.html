<h1>Conditional Binding Receipt</h1>

<p>A receipt involved in life, health and certain property insurance contracts; if the insured is deemed to be covered by the insurer, the coverage begins on the date the insured receives the conditional binding receipt. Typically, a premium payment must be received by the insurer along with a completed acceptable application in order for the insured to obtain the receipt.</p>

<p>This may also be called a "conditional receipt" or a "binding receipt" depending on the type of insurance.</p>

<p>As long as the insured is going to receive the policy anyway, the insurer is obliged to cover a claim should one occur between the time the application is received and the time the policy is officially in place.</p>

<p>If however, the insured is denied coverage as the typical underwriting process progresses, the insurer could nullify the conditional binding receipt, even if a premium was collected.</p>
