<h1>Sector Analysis</h1>

<p>A review and assessment of the current condition and future prospects of a given sector of the economy. Sector analysis serves to provide an investor with an idea of how well a given group of companies are expected to perform as a whole.</p>

<p>Sector analysis is typically employed by investors who are practicing a sector-rotation strategy, or by those who are using a top-down approach to selecting stock to invest in. In the top-down approach to investing, the most promising sectors are identified first, and then the investor reviews the companies within that sector to determine which individual stocks will ultimately be purchased.</p>
