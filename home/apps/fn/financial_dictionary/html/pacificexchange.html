<h1>Pacific Exchange - PCX</h1>

<p>An exchange network that coordinates the trading of stock options between both institutional and individual investors. The PCX was one of four U.S. exchanges to trade equity options and the first to develop and implement an electronic trading system. At one time, the PCX had operations in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, but both closed in early 2000 when the PCX partnered with the Archipelago Exchange. ArcaEx later merged with the New York Stock Exchange and PCX transactions are now conducted on the NYSE Arca platform.</p>

<p>PCX was originally formed in San Francisco in 1882 as the Stock and Bond Exchange. It officially got its name in 1957 when the San Francisco and Los Angeles stock exchanges merged. For years, the PCX was a mainstay in San Francisco's financial district, but its open outcry system of trading became archaic with the advent of computers and computer trading. It ceased operations in 2005.</p>
