<h1>Anticipated Balance</h1>

<p>The amount that a savings account will have at some future date, or that a time deposit will have at maturity, assuming no withdrawals or additional deposits occur. In broad terms, anticipated balance means the net balance in any account at a future point in time. Calculation of the anticipated balance assumes compound interest, rather than simple interest.</p>

<p>Anticipated balances are important in the context of financial planning. For example, consider a couple that wants to save $20,000 over the next four years as the down payment for a house.</p>

<p>They currently have $10,000 in savings, and to achieve their dream of becoming homeowners, would like to know approximately how much they should save per year in a time deposit, in order to reach their target of an anticipated balance of $20,000 in four years. Assuming a compound interest rate on deposits of 3% per annum, they would need to save $2,390 per year.</p>
