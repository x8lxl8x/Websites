<h1>Investment In The Contract</h1>

<p>As this term applies to annuities, the principal amount that the contract owner has invested in the contract. The investment in the contract can be made as a series of payments or in a single lump sum. This term generally applies to fixed, indexed and variable annuities alike.</p>

<p>Any amount of money withdrawn from an annuity that is in excess of the investment in the contract is considered a taxable distribution. Investors who annuitize their contracts will see a portion of each payment they receive classified as a return of principal or investment in the contract. This portion of each payment is considered a tax-free return of principal.</p>
