<h1>Free File Fillable Tax Forms</h1>

<p>Electronic versions of tax forms, first posted by the IRS in 2009, to allow taxpayers, regardless of their income, to file their taxes online at no cost. Free file fillable tax forms are meant to speed up the process of receiving refunds, and minimize errors in filing. Taxpayers file their tax returns by accessing the forms on the IRS' website, entering their tax data, and then signing and filing electronically.</p>

<p>Free file fillable tax forms, are digital versions of the hard-copy forms, and are designed for advanced users that know which forms are needed to be used. Unlike many commercial tax preparations software packages that also allow taxpayers to file online, these forms do not have a step-by-step interview to ensure that every deduction and credit is taken advantage of.</p>
