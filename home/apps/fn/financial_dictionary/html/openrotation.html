<h1>Open Rotation</h1>

<p>An order to buy or sell a security that is to remain active through the day's opening trading rotation. Open rotation orders that are not filled during the initial rotation automatically expire.</p>

<p>Investors may use an open rotation in order to buy or sell a security at the opening price. An open rotation does not necessarily mean that the order is to be executed at opening bell, as it can also apply to trades that are executed when the market has been closed for any reason, including technical issues.</p>
