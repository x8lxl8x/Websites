<h1>Call On A Call</h1>

<p>A type of compound option in which the investor has the right to exercise a call on the underlying asset, which is an option. An investor who owns a call on a call option has until the expiration date to exercise the compound option. If exercised, the investor will receive the underlying call option, which will have a set expiration date and a new exercise price. If the underlying option is exercised, the investor receives the underlying assets.</p>

<p>A compound option is an option in which the underlying asset is itself an option - so it is an option on an option. Before expiration, the value of the option depends on the value of the asset the underlying option represents. At expiration, the option can be priced at expiration using the Metron model. This means that the value of the call on a call option (with the underlying good being a stock) increases as the stock's price increases.</p>

<p>An investor will exercise the call on a call option if, at the expiration date, the price of the underlying call option is worth more than the exercise price of the option.</p>
