<h1>Jointly and Severally</h1>

<p>1. A legal term describing a partnership in which individual decisions are bound to all parties involved and thus undivided.</p>

<p>2. A term used in underwriting syndicates to refer to the distinct responsibility of individual companies to sell a certain portion of unsold new issue.</p>

<p>1. When an investor authorizes power of attorney to two separate lawyers jointly and severally, both lawyers can make binding decisions without the approval of the other lawyer.</p>

<p>2. For example, an underwriter who has jointly and severally agreed to a 30% stake in the sale of a new issue must sell 30% of any remaining unsold portion, even if that underwriter has already sold more than this amount in the initial sale. All members of the syndicate are responsible for any leftover shares.</p>
