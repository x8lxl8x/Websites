<h1>Nest Egg</h1>

<p>A substantial sum of money that has been saved or invested for a specific purpose. A nest egg is generally earmarked for longer-term objectives, the most common being retirement, buying a home and education. It can also refer to money kept aside as a reserve to deal with unexpected emergencies such as a medical problem or urgent housing repairs. "Nest egg" has been used to refer to savings since the late 17<sup>th</sup> century. The term is believed to have been derived from poultry farmers' tactic of placing eggs - both real and fake - in hens' nests to induce them to lay more eggs, which meant more income for these farmers.</p>

<p>The foremost investment objective of a nest egg is generally preserving capital, since it represents funds that have been accumulated over a considerable time. However, the portfolio should also have a growth component to offset the effects of inflation over time. A nest egg should typically be invested in relatively conservative instruments such as certificates of deposit, bonds and dividend-paying blue chips. The exact allocation of these securities within a nest egg should be based on asset allocation principles as well as the investor's risk tolerance and comfort level.</p>

<p>It would be folly to invest nest egg proceeds in certain volatile investments in hopes of achieving a high rate of return. These investments include commodities, small-cap stocks and currencies, since their inherent volatility makes them less suited for conservative investing.</p>
