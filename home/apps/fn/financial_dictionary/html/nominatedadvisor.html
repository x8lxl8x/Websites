<h1>Nominated Advisor - NOMAD</h1>

<p>A company that has been approved as a nominated advisor for the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), by the London Stock Exchange. Individuals are not permitted to becoming nominated advisors, and there are certain criteria that must be met by a company before it is approved for membership.</p>

<p>The basic criteria for a potential nominated advisor is that the company has to have practiced corporate finance for two years, been a financial advisor in three qualified transactions in two years and must employ at least four "qualified executives".</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of a NOMAD is to help a new company in its admission to the AIM, and to provide advice to avoid the delisting of the new company.</p>
