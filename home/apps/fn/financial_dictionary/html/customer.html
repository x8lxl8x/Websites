<h1>Customer</h1>

<p>An individual or business that purchases the goods or services produced by a business. The customer is the end goal of businesses, since it is the customer who pays for supply and creates demand. Businesses will often compete through advertisements or sales in order to attract a larger customer base.</p>

<p>Businesses often follow the adage that "the customer is always right" because happy customers will continue to buy goods and services. Companies closely-monitor the relationships that they have with their customers, eliciting feedback to see if new products should be created or adjustments be made to what is currently offered.</p>
