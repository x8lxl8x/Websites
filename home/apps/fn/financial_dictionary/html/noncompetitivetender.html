<h1>Non-Competitive Tender</h1>

<p>One of the two bid processes for buying debt issuances. Non-competitive tender is for small investors, while competitive tender is for large institutional investors. The price that a non-competitive bidder receives is the average bid price of all competitive bids.</p>

<p>Also known as a "non-competitive bid".</p>

<p>This is a method of distribution used primarily by the U.S. Treasury. The minimum non-competitive tender is $10,000, and these are usually made through a Federal Reserve Bank or a commercial bank.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee on the price or the amount received.</p>
