<h1>Second-To-Die Insurance</h1>

<p>A type of life insurance on two people (usually married) that provides benefits to the heirs only after the last surviving spouse dies. This differs from regular life insurance in that the surviving partner doesn't receive any benefits after their spouse dies. Thus, second-to-die insurance is used for estate planning.</p>

<p>Parents who take out this type of insurance are thinking of their children, not themselves. For example, it could be designed to pay estate taxes or support any surviving children. It is also called "Dual-Life Insurance" and "Survivorship Insurance".</p>
