<h1>Economic Growth Rate</h1>

<p>A measure of economic growth from one period to another in percentage terms. This measure does not adjust for inflation, it is expressed in nominal terms.</p>

<p>In practice, it is a measure of the rate of change that a nation's gross domestic product goes through from one year to another. Gross national product can also be used if a nation's economy is heavily dependent on foreign earnings.</p>

<p>The economic growth rate provides insight into the general direction and magnitude of growth for the overall economy. In the United States, for example, the long-term economic growth rate is around 2-5%, this lower rate is seen in most highly industrialized countries. Fast-growing economies, on the other hand, see rates as high as 10% although this rate of growth is not likely to be sustainable over the long term.</p>
