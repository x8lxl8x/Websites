<h1>Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate - STIBOR</h1>

<p>The official interbank offer rate for short term loans in Sweden. The Stockholm Interbank Offer Rate is determined by the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, and is often used for one or three month terms. STIBOR is the interest rate banks are charged when borrowing from other banks for maturities longer than overnight.</p>

<p>STIBOR is used in Sweden similar to how LIBOR is used in the United States and United Kingdom. It serves as a benchmark for many floating interest rate instruments. The rate is to be used for short term loans, which are less than one year in a maturity.</p>
