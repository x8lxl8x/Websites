<h1>Unqualified Opinion</h1>

<p>An independent auditor's judgment that a company's financial records and statements are fairly and appropriately presented, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). An unqualified opinion is the most common type of auditor's report.</p>

<p>An unqualified opinion is issued when the independent auditor believes that the company's financial statements are sound; that is, the statements are free from material misstatements. This is different from a qualified opinion which is issued when the independent auditor discovers something in the financial statements that is subject to major concern.</p>
