<h1>Market Value Of Equity</h1>

<p>The total dollar market value of all of a company's outstanding shares. Market value of equity is calculated by multiplying the company's current stock price by its number of outstanding shares. A company's market value of equity is therefore always changing as these two input variables change. A company's market value of equity differs from its book value of equity because the former does not take into account the company's growth potential.</p>

<p>Market value of equity is basically a synonym for market capitalization. It is used to measure a company's size and helps investors to diversity their investments across companies of different sizes and different levels of risk.</p>
