<h1>Aggregate Demand</h1>

<p>The total amount of goods and services demanded in the economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period. It is represented by the aggregate-demand curve, which describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Normally there is a negative relationship between aggregate demand and the price level. Also known as "total spending".</p>

<p>Aggregate demand is the demand for the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country, and is represented by this formula:</p>

<p>Aggregate Demand (AD) = C + I + G + (X-M)   C = Consumers' expenditures on goods and services. I = Investment spending by companies on capital goods. G = Government expenditures on publicly provided goods and services. X = Exports of goods and services. M = Imports of goods and services.</p>
