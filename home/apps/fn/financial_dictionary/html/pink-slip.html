<h1>Pink Slip </h1>

<p>An informal or slang term referring to a notice of dismissal given to an employee. A pink slip is an official notification that a worker's position has been eliminated or that the worker's services are no longer needed. In other words, a pink slip is a termination notice.</p>

<p>A pink slip notifies an employee that he or she has been laid off or fired. The term can also be used as a verb, as in "I was pink-slipped today and no longer have a job." Pink slips can be handed out individually or en masse, as with large lay-offs and company closures.</p>
