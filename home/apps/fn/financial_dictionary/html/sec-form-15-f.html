<h1>SEC Form 15F</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Certification of a Foreign Private Issuer's and Termination of Registration. It is used by private foreign companies to revoke the registration of their securities traded on U.S. exchanges. SEC Form 15F is also used by foreign companies to notify the SEC and investors of the intent to cease filing required forms because their securities no longer meet certain filing requirements.</p>

<p>When a foreign company files a SEC Form 15-F, it means one of two things. It may mean that a company's securities are ceasing to exist in a publicly-traded form in the U.S., although they still may be available on a foreign exchange. Alternatively, it may mean that a company is simply canceling a certain class of securities in order to replace them with another class.</p>
