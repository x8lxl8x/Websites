<h1>Committee On Payment And Settlement Systems - CPSS</h1>

<p>A committee made up of the central banks of G10 countries that monitors developments in payment, settlement and clearing systems in an attempt to contribute to efficient payment and settlement systems, and build strong market infrastructure. The CPSS was created in 1990, and its secretariat is hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems undertakes its work through specific studies by working groups as required, and publishes reports on its findings. The committee also extends its work outside of the G10 countries by creating relationships with the central banks in many emerging market economies.</p>
