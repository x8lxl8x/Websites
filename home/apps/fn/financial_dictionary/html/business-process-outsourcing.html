<h1>Business Process Outsourcing - BPO</h1>

<p>A method of subcontracting various business-related operations to a third party. When business process outsourcing  began, it applied chiefly to manufacturing entities, such as soft drink manufacturers. However, it is now applicable to the outsourcing of services.</p>

<p>Business process outsourcing is known as offshore outsourcing if the outsourcing is sent to another country. It is known as nearshore outsourcing if it is done with a neighboring country. Another form of BPO is known as information-technology-enabled service (ITES).</p>
