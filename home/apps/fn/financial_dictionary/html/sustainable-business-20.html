<h1>Sustainable Business 20 - SB20</h1>

<p>A group of stocks that are chosen according to the companies' ability to provide products and services while contributing to a sustainable economy. The SB20 are selected yearly by a panel of judges with experience in analyzing sustainable stocks. The list attempts to identify innovative and progressive companies with the potential to positively affect the goal of a more sustainable society.</p>

<p>The SB20 is not a list of top buys. Rather, it is a list of companies that are both financially strong and sustainable. The stock list comprises companies of various sizes, locations and industries, but it doesn't create a well diversified portfolio.</p>

<p>Two main criteria are used when picking SB20 stock:</p>

<p><b>Sustainable:</b> the company must be exciting and must excel in solving social or environmental problems.
<b>Financial:</b> The company must be profitable (or close to it) and have a stock trading over $1.00.</p>
