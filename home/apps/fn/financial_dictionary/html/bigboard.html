<h1>Big Board</h1>

<p>A nickname for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located at 11 Wall Street, New York City. The New York Stock Exchange, or Big Board, is the oldest stock exchange in the United States. It is the world's largest stock exchange, in terms of the market capitalization of its listed stocks. Two of the NYSE buildings are designated as National Historic Landmarks.</p>

<p>The NYSE originated in 1792 with the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement and acquired its current name in 1863. The Big Board is open for trading Monday through Friday, with regular trading session hours scheduled between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST. The NYSE is closed on weekends and for certain holidays, and rarely during catastrophic events, such as the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, which closed the NYSE for four sessions.</p>
