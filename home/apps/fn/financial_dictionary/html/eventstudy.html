<h1>Event Study</h1>

<p>An empirical study performed on a security that has experienced a significant catalyst occurrence, and has subsequently changed dramatically in value as a result of that catalyst. The event can have either a positive or negative effect on the value of the security.</p>

<p>Examples of events that influence the value of a security will be a result of the company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the announcement of a merger, or from the result of the company defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>

<p>Event studies can reveal important information about how a security is likely to react to a given event, and can help predict how other securities are likely to react to different events.</p>
