<h1>Booking the Basis</h1>

<p>An arrangement made between a buyer and seller giving either party the ability, at some future date, to determine the cash price of the forward sales agreement. Once the basis of a futures contract is booked, it is applied to the current futures price and is maintained for the duration of the contract. Also known as "deferred pricing."</p>

<p>Booking the basis is used to calculate what the price will be at some time in the future. First the parties agree upon the formula or basis. Then, at a later date, the price is found by applying the previously agreed upon basis to the current futures quotation.</p>
