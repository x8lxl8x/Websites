<h1>Tenancy At Sufferance</h1>

<p>An agreement in which a property renter is permitted to live in a property after a lease term has expired, but before the landlord demands the tenant vacate the property. If a tenancy at sufferance occurs, the original lease conditions must be met, including the payment of any rents. Otherwise, the tenant can be evicted at any time without notice.</p>

<p>A tenancy at sufferance, also termed "estate at sufferance" or "holdover tenancy", arises when a tenant who has a lawful possession of a property (for example, a lease) holds over without the owner's consent. The only difference between a tenant at sufferance and trespasser is that the tenant entered into possession in a legal manner but has now overstayed his or her welcome.</p>
