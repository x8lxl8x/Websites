<h1>Icahn Lift</h1>

<p>The name given to the rise in stock price that occurs when Carl Icahn begins to purchase shares in a company. The Icahn lift occurs because of Mr. Icahn's reputation for creating value for the shareholders of the companies in which he takes an interest.</p>

<p>Carl Icahn is most famous for his work as an activist shareholder, but has also been referred to as a corporate raider. He purchases shares in a company that he believes is undervalued and then creates a plan to fix the problems. This usually involves spinning off profitable segments, changing management, cutting costs and buying back stock.</p>
