<h1>Sweep Account</h1>

<p>A bank account that automatically transfers amounts that exceed (or fall short of) a certain level into a higher interest earning investment option at the close of each business day. Commonly, the excess cash is swept into money market funds.</p>

<p>In a sweep program, a bank's computers analyze customer use of checkable deposits and "sweeps" funds into money market deposit accounts.</p>

<p>This is done to provide the customer with the greatest amount of interest with the minimum amount of personal intervention. That said, sweep accounts were originally devised to get around a government regulation that limited banks from offering interest on commercial checking accounts. Now, some brokerage accounts have similar features that enable investors to gain some additional return for unused cash.</p>
