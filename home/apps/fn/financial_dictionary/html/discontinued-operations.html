<h1>Discontinued Operations</h1>

<p>A segment of a company's business that has been sold, disposed of or abandoned. Discontinued operations can range from a certain product line to an entire line of business. When operations are discontinued, this is reported on the company's income statement as separate from income from continued operations.</p>

<p>Because income from discontinued operations is listed separately on the income statement, investors are less likely to be misled as to the source of a company's profit. This is especially useful when companies merge, since parsing out which assets are being divested or folded up gives a clearer picture of how a company will make money in the future.</p>
