<h1>Nonmonetary Transaction</h1>

<p>Transactions that do not result in a transfer of funds between accounts. Nonmonetary transactions can be something as simple as a change of address or can refer to more complex transactions in the financial sector. For example, a $0 deposit to initiate an automated clearing house transaction (e.g., direct deposit or auto-withdrawal) would be considered a nonmonetary transaction.</p>

<p>The even exchange of assets (e.g., transferring property or inventory) is a nonmonetary transaction. In cases of property exchange, the fair values of the underlying assets need to be determined, if possible.</p>

<p>Nonmonetary transactions can be either reciprocal or nonreciprocal. Reciprocal (two-way) nonmonetary transactions involve two or more parties exchanging nonmonetary goods, services or assets. Nonreciprocal (one-way) nonmonetary transactions involve the transfer of goods, services or assets from one party to another, such as a business making an in-kind donation of employee volunteer time or physical items to another organization.</p>
