<h1>Twit Pitch</h1>

<p>A slang term used to describe an overview of a product or service that is short enough to fit in the character limitations of the social networking website Twitter. A twit pitch is a variation of an elevator pitch, but with the constraint being the 140 character limit imposed by Twitter instead of the time spent in an elevator.</p>

<p>The advent of new technology and the impact it has on modern business has made longer business proposals a thing of the past. Venture capitalists and executives who were forced to divvy up their limited time reading lengthy proposals may decide if a proposal warrants further reading by examining twit pitches for key words. This places more pressure on the person making the proposal, as he or she will have to explain a potentially complex topic in a small amount of space.</p>
