<h1>Debris Removal Insurance</h1>

<p>A section of a property insurance policy that provides reimbursement for clean-up costs associated with damage to a property. Policies with a debris removal provision typically only cover debris resulting from an insured peril, such as charred wood from a building fire.</p>

<p>Policies commonly have a cap on the amount of reimbursement that a policyholder can receive for debris removal costs. While policies typically have debris removal as a standard provision, the policyholder is often able to purchase additional coverage.</p>

<p>The policy provision may also extend to the removal of hazardous materials that may cover the property, but could exclude pollutants.</p>
