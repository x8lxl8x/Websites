<h1>Honorary International Investors Council (HIIC)</h1>

<p>An organization of prominent investors from around the world that advises the Nigerian government on matters pertaining to the country's economic development. The council's goals include reducing political corruption, helping Nigeria to become Nigeria more competitive in the global economy.</p>

<p>Established in 2004, HIIC holds two meetings per year. Nigeria is considered an emerging market economy. It has one of the higher GDPs in the world and is prosperous by African standards. However, the country faces many challenges to investment, including crime, violence, ethnic tensions, poverty, political instability, a history of colonial and military rule and fighting over the country's oil resources.</p>
