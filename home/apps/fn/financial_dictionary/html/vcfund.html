<h1>Venture Capital Funds</h1>

<p>An investment fund that manages money from investors seeking private equity stakes in startup and small- and medium-size enterprises with strong growth potential. These investments are generally characterized as high-risk/high-return opportunities.</p>

<p>Theoretically, venture capital funds give individual investors the ability to get in early at a company's startup stage or in special situations in which there is opportunity for explosive growth. In the past, venture capital investments were only accessible to professional venture capitalists. While a fund structure diversifies risk, these funds are inherently risky.</p>
