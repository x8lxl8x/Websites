<h1>Single Euro Payment Area - SEPA </h1>

<p>A system that is designed to create financial efficiency for countries using the euro by providing a unified system in which to perform financial transactions. The SEPA seeks to create a better system for credit transfers, an improved debit system and a cheaper way for individuals and firms to make transactions within member countries or regions.</p>

<p>The European Commission wants the European market to be self sufficient by the year 2010, but banks will begin to implement SEPA in 2008. Up to 29 countries are slated to become a part of SEPA; the goal is to make a unified system in which financial transactions can be performed with reduced transaction costs and greater efficiency.</p>
