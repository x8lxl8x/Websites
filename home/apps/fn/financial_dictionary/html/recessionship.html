<h1>Recessionship</h1>

<p>A slang term used to describe an intimate relationship that forms during a recession. People in a recessionship usually meet after losing their jobs or after incurring some sort of financial hardship. The term recessionship was originally coined during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.</p>

<p>The loss of jobs often leaves individuals feeling vulnerable and seeking companionship. During a recession, the number of people who lose their jobs is compounded, which means that more individuals are entering the dating market. Many people in recessionships point to extra free time, less disposable income and lack of work stress as contributing factors to their recessionships.</p>
