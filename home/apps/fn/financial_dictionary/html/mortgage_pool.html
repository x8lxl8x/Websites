<h1>Mortgage Pool</h1>

<p>A group of mortgages held in trust as collateral for the issuance of a mortgage-backed security. Some mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are known as "pools" themselves. These are the simplest form of mortgage-backed security. They are also known as "pass-throughs" and trade in the to-be-announced (TBA) forward market.</p>

<p>Pass-throughs or pools are comprised of mortgages with close to the same maturity and interest rate. A pool of mortgages that backs a more complex mortgage-backed security or CDO, however, might consist of mortgages of more varying interest rates and characteristics.</p>
