<h1>Small Business Investment Company - SBIC</h1>

<p>A privately-owned investment company that is licensed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) supply small businesses with financing in both the equity and debt arenas. They provide a viable alternative to venture capital firms for many small enterprises seeking startup capital.</p>

<p>Small Business Investment Companies are allowed to borrow from the federal government in order to augment the funds of private investors. SBICs usually focus on investments in the $100,000 to $250,000 range, and tend to be considerably more forgiving than venture capital firms in their underwriting requirements.</p>
