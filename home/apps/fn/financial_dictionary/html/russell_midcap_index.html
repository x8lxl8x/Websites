<h1>Russell Midcap Index</h1>

<p>A market capitalization weighted index representing the smallest 800 companies in the Russell 1000 Index. The average Russell Midcap Index member has a market cap of $8 billion to $10 billion, with a median value of $4 billion to $5 billion. The index is reconstituted annually so that stocks that have outgrown the index can be removed and new entries can be added.</p>

<p>The Russell Midcap Index is a complete subset of both the Russell 1000 and the Russell 3000.  Midcap fund managers have few good indexes against which to benchmark their returns, making the Russell Midcap Index a valuable one for institutional portfolio managers. The range of market caps covered in this 800-member index goes from about $1 billion on the low end to roughly $20 billion.</p>
