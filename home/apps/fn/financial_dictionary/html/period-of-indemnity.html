<h1>Period Of Indemnity</h1>

<p>The length of time for which benefits are payable under an insurance policy. Also used to denote the time period for which indemnity or compensation is payable under a business interruption policy. The period of indemnity is usually the most critical component of quantifying the business interruption loss.</p>

<p>For example, if a disability policy provides for six months of income in the event of an accident, the period of indemnity would be six months. An extended period of indemnity endorsement in a business interruption policy provides insurance coverage for loss of income for a specified period after the damaged property has been repaired and business has reopened.</p>
