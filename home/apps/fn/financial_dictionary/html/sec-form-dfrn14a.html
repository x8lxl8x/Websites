<h1>SEC Form DFRN14A</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) used by non-management to file definitive proxy soliciting materials requiring a shareholder vote. SEC Form DFRN14A should provide security holders with sufficient information about the issue at hand to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about: the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details.</p>

<p>Form DFRN14A, which is also known as revised definitive proxy statement filed by non-management, is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.</p>
