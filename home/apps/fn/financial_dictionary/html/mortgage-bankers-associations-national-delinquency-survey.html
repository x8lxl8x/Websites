<h1>Mortgage Bankers Association's National Delinquency Survey - NDS</h1>

<p>A voluntary survey of over 120 mortgage lenders, including mortgage banks, commercial banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations, subservicers, credit unions and life insurance companies, aimed at measuring the overall non-payment of mortgage loans. The Mortgage Bankers Association's National Delinquency Survey collects data from the Census Bureau and other industry data. The quarterly reports produced from this survey includes residential mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates at the national, regional and state levels.</p>

<p>According to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), the survey's delinquency and foreclosure measures are divided into loan type (prime, subprime, VA and FHA), and fixed and adjustable rate products. Categories include new foreclosures, foreclosure inventory, total delinquencies, delinquency by past due category (30-59 days past due, 60-89 days and 90 days and over), and seriously delinquent loans. The total number of loans serviced each quarter is also included in the data collected. The survey data is seasonally adjusted to account for trends.</p>
