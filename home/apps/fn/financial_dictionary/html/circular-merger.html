<h1>Circular Merger</h1>

<p>A transaction to combine companies that operate within the same general market but offer a different product mix. A circular merger is one of the three types of mergers, the other two types being vertical and horizontal mergers. A company engages in a circular merger to offer a greater range of products or services within their market.</p>

<p>A circular merger can be risky if the acquiring company does not have specific expertise within the targeted market segment. Sometimes, expanding offerings too far from the company's expertise can lead to greater inefficiency, rather than the economies of scale that are often hoped for. However, the acquiring company can benefit from economies of scale and the sharing of distribution channels.</p>
