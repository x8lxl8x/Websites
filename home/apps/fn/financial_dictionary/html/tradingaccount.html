<h1>Trading Account</h1>

<p>1. An account similar to a traditional bank account, holding cash and securities, and is administered by an investment dealer.</p>

<p>2. An account held at a financial institution and administered by an investment dealer that the account holder uses to employ a trading strategy rather than a buy-and-hold investment strategy.</p>

<p>1. Though trading accounts are traditionally thought to hold only stocks, a trading account can hold cash, foreign cash, securities and a number of other types of investments.</p>

<p>2. Investors who use a number of trading strategies or have a number of brokerage accounts may separate their accounts in order to avoid confusion. One account may be a registered account for their retirement savings; another account may be a buy-and-hold account for their long-term stocks; another may be a margin account; and another may be a trading account used for conducting day-trading activities.</p>
