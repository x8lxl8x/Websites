<h1>Nasdaq SmallCap Market</h1>

<p>The Nasdaq equity market for companies that have relatively small levels of market capitalization. Listing requirements for such "small cap" companies on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market are less stringent than for other Nasdaq markets that list larger companies with significantly higher market capitalization. In 2005, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market was renamed the Nasdaq Capital Market in order to reflect its core function of raising capital.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq Capital Market makes it relatively easier for early-stage companies to get listed compared to other senior exchanges with more onerous requirements. In order to list initially on the Nasdaq Capital Market, companies must meet all of the criteria under at least one of three listing standards - the equity standard, the market value of listed securities standard, or the total assets/total revenue standard.</p>
