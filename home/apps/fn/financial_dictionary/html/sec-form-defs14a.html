<h1>SEC Form DEFS14A</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be filed when definitive proxy materials were provided to shareholders with regard to a special meeting. SEC Form DEFS14A was intended to provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It included information about the date, time and place of the meeting; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details.</p>

<p>Form DEFS14A was required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form was filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement was given to shareholders to help the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights would be upheld.</p>
