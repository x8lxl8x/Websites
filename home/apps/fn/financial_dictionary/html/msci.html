<p>MSCI is perhaps best known for its indices, which it began offering in the late 1960s. Its Capital International indices, which became available in 1969, were the first global stock market indices for markets outside the U.S. One of its most well-known products is the MSCI EAFE index, which tracks the performance of about two dozen developed countries in Europe, Australasia and the Far East. This index is widely used as a benchmark for the total international stock market.</p>
