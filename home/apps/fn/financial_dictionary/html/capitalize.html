<h1>Capitalize</h1>

<p>An accounting method used to delay the recognition of expenses by recording the expense as long-term assets.</p>

<p>In general, capitalizing expenses is beneficial as companies acquiring new assets with a long-term lifespan can spread out the cost over a specified period of time. Companies take expenses that they incur today and deduct them over the long term without an immediate negative affect against revenues.</p>

<p>If a company capitalizes regular operating expenses, it is doing so inappropriately, most likely to artificially boost its operating cash flow and look like a more profitable company. Because a company can't hide its expenses forever, such a practice will fail in the long run.</p>

<p>It is important not to confuse capitalize with capitalization.</p>
