<h1>Above Par</h1>

<p>A term used to describe the price of a security when it is trading above its face value. A security usually trades at above par when its income distributions are higher than those of other instruments currently available in the market.</p>

<p>If an investor purchases a security above face value, he or she will incur a capital loss at maturity when it is redeemed for face value.</p>

<p>For example, a 5-year bond with $1,000 face value that pays a coupon of 10% annually may trade closer to $1,168 if similar bond rates decline to 6%. This is because investors are willing to pay more for a higher coupon; thus, it is said to be trading above par.</p>

<p>In order to make its yield equal current market rates, the bond should trade at its present value.</p>

<p>In the above example, the following calculation was used to determine the theoretical price the bond would trade at</p>

<p>N = 5 years
I/Y = 6 (market rate, 6%)
FV = $1,000 (face value)
PMT = $100 (10% coupon)
Payments/Year = 1 (annual coupon payment)</p>
