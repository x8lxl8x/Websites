<h1>Regression</h1>

<p>A statistical measure that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables).</p>

<p>The two basic types of regression are linear regression and multiple regression. Linear regression uses one independent variable to explain and/or predict the outcome of Y, while multiple regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. The general form of each type of regression is:</p>

<p>Linear Regression: Y = a + bX + u
Multiple Regression: Y = a + b<SUB>1</SUB>X<SUB>1 <SUP>+</SUP> </SUB> b<SUB>2</SUB>X<SUB>2</SUB> + B<SUB>3</SUB>X<SUB>3</SUB> + ... + B<SUB>t</SUB>X<SUB>t</SUB> + u</p>

<p>Where:
Y= the variable that we are trying to predict
X= the variable that we are using to predict Y
a= the intercept
b= the slope
u= the regression residual.</p>

<p>In multiple regression the separate variables are differentiated by using subscripted numbers.</p>

<p>Regression takes a group of random variables, thought to be predicting Y, and tries to find a mathematical relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) that best approximates all the individual data points. Regression is often used to determine how much specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest rates, particular industries or sectors influence the price movement of an asset.</p>
