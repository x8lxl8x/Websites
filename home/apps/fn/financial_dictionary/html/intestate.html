<h1>Intestate</h1>

<p>The act of dying without a legal will. Determining the distribution of the deceased's assets then becomes the responsibility of a probate court.</p>

<p>To have died "in intestacy" means a court-appointed executor will compile any assets of the deceased, pay any liabilities and distribute the assets to those parties deemed as beneficiaries.</p>

<p>To ensure that your friends and loved ones receive the contents of your estate upon your passing on, it is extremely important to make a will, or have a will made on your behalf by a lawyer qualified to do so.</p>
