<h1>James J. Heckman</h1>

<p>An American economist who won the 2000 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, along with Daniel McFadden, for his Heckman correction, a statistical method of correcting for self-selection bias in research. In addition to selection bias and self-selection, Heckman's research has focused on labor economics and human development, and skill formation (especially early childhood development).</p>

<p>Heckman was born in 1944 in Chicago. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton and won the John Bates Clark medal in 1983. He has worked as a professor of economics at University College in Dublin; he also taught at the University of Chicago, Columbia and Yale.</p>
