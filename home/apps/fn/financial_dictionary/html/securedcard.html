<h1>Secured Card</h1>

<p>A type of credit card that is backed by a savings account used as collateral on the credit available with the card. Money is deposited and held in the account backing the card. The limit will be based on both your previous credit history and the amount deposited in the account. The limit as a percent of the deposit tends to range between 50% and 100%.</p>

<p>This type of credit card is used by people with little to no credit or a past history of bad credit. The major benefit that these cards provide is the ability to rebuild or establish a credit history which at some point may allow users to gain unsecured credit cards or other forms of credit finance. Another benefit of secured cards is that holders can purchase products that can only be paid for with credit cards such as with some online retailers.           </p>
