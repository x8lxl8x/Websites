<h1>Effective Debt</h1>

<p>The net sum of all of a company's outstanding debt. In addition to standard debt issues, this figure will also aggregate and capitalize any payments that the company is regularly making, such as mortgage or lease payments.</p>

<p>The effective debt metric gives investors a more accurate measure of a company's overall debt load. Companies operating in certain sectors, such as real estate and retail, can have a good portion of their liabilities tied up in real estate leases and payments, and a thorough cash flow analysis should take these payments into account.</p>
