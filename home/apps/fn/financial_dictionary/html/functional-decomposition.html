<h1>Functional Decomposition</h1>

<p>A method of business analysis that dissects a complex business process to show its individual elements. Functional decomposition is used to facilitate the understanding and management of large and/or complex processes and can be used to help solve problems. Functional decomposition is also used in computer engineering to help with software design.</p>

<p>Basically, functional decomposition takes something complicated and simplifies it. The individual elements of the process and their hierarchical relationship to each other are commonly displayed in a diagram called a functional decomposition diagram. Other common business methods for simplifying complex problems and processes include decision trees, which allow users to consider multiple possible solutions to a problem, and flow charts, which show the sequence of a process.</p>
