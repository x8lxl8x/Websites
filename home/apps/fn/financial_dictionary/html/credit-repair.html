<h1>Credit Repair</h1>

<p>Credit repair is the process of fixing a bad credit report, for whatever reason it deteriorated in the first place. It may be as simple as fixing mistakes with the credit agencies. Identity theft may require extensive credit repair work. The second form of credit repair is to deal with fundamental financial issues, such as budgeting, and begin to address legitimate concerns on the part of lenders.</p>

<p>A number of businesses claiming to do credit repair have sprung up in recent years, and while some are legitimate, others are not. In some cases, credit repair may require legal as well as financial expertise. Depending on the extent of the problem, it may require simply cleaning up misunderstandings, while in other cases professional intervention is needed.</p>
