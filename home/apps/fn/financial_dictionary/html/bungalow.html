<h1>Bungalow</h1>

<p>A one-story house, cottage or cabin. Bungalows are generally small in terms of square footage, but it is not uncommon to see very large bungalows. Bungalows were originally designed to provide affordable, modern housing for the working class.</p>

<p>There are various types of bungalows, including raised bungalows that have basements with partially above ground to let in additional light. There are also bungalows that branch away from the original definition by adding additional levels such as lofts and half levels.</p>
