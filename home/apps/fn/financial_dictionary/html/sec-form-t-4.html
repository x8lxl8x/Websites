<h1>SEC Form T-4</h1>

<p>An application for exemption from certain sections of the Trust Indenture Act that must be filed with the SEC. The application contains a list of the securities that are being exempted, as well as the specific sections of the act that the securities are to be exempt from. Further information pertaining to the trustee and the characteristics of the proposed exempt securities is required, as well.</p>

<p>This application is required by section 304(c) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This act was created to insure that domestic bond issuers were financially able to guarantee the principal and interest due the bondholders. This form is therefore to ensure that any securities that are exempt from any part of the act will not pose a risk to investors. Forms related to this filing include Form T-6 and Form T-3.</p>
