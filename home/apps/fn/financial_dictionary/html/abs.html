<h1>Automated Bond System - ABS</h1>

<p>The electronic system on the NYSE that records bids and offers for inactively traded bonds until they are canceled or executed.
Because the bid and ask prices of inactively traded bonds aren't constantly changing due to demand and supply conditions, investors looking for a quote may have difficulties. By having all inactive bonds electronically monitored, the NYSE is able to keep a good inventory of bond prices, just in case an investor is interested in purchasing them.           </p>
