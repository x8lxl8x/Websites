<h1>Vandalism And Malicious Mischief Insurance</h1>

<p>A type of insurance coverage that protects against losses sustained as a result of vandals. Vandalism and malicious mischief insurance is included in most basic commercial and homeowner policies. It is important for properties that are not occupied during well-known periods of the day, such as with churches and schools. While these structures are unoccupied, they become targets by vandals because the vandals know there is reduced risk of being caught.</p>

<p>This coverage typically carries a higher deductible for properties that are known to be unoccupied for certain hours of the day due to the risk and frequency of loss (such as churches and schools). Vandalism and mischief is described as the intentional injury or destruction of property. Vandalism and malicious mischief can be written as an endorsement to standard policies, such as the standard fire policy, in the event that the policy requires a separate endorsement for this type of coverage.</p>
