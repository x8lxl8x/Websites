<h1>Customer Relationship Management - CRM</h1>

<p>The principles, practices, and guidelines that an organization follows when interacting with its customers. From the organization's point of view, this entire relationship not only encompasses the direct interaction aspect, such as sales and/or service related processes, but also in the forecasting and analysis of customer trends and behaviors, which ultimately serve to enhance the customer's overall experience.</p>

<p>With the growth of the internet and related technologies, customers are concerned over the privacy and safety of their personal information. Therefore, businesses need to ensure that the storage and analysis of the customer data must have the highest levels of protection against cyber criminals, identity theft and other breaches of securities.</p>
