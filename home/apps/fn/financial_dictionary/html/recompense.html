<h1>Recompense</h1>

<p>The act of awarding a target person, group or entity some form of monetary benefit as a result of the target performing some action or as a result of some action happening to the target. This is one of the main tenets of capitalism, as people perform a task as a result of being paid some sort of relevant incentive.</p>

<p>For example, companies may pay its workers with a special cash bonus as a result of the workers' efforts in contributing to the company's profits. However, a company may have to pay a compensation as a result of an injury that happened to the worker as a result of  the company's negligence.</p>
