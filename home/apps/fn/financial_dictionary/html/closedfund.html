<h1>Closed Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that has been closed - either temporarily or permanently - to new investors because the investment advisor has determined that the fund's asset base is getting too large to effectively execute its investing style.</p>

<p>Generally, current shareholders in a closed mutual fund are permitted to continue investing in the fund, but sometimes they are also be precluded from making additional investments.</p>

<p>A closed mutual fund should not be confused with a closed-end fund. This type of fund has a  fixed number of shares, generally invests in specialized sectors, and is structured and listed as a stock on a stock exchange.</p>
