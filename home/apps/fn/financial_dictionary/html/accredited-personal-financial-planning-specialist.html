<h1>Accredited Personal Financial Planning Specialist </h1>

<p>A professional designation for Certified Public Accountants who have completed the required coursework and passed an examination administered by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. The Accredited Personal Financial Planning Specialist designation enables the accountant to offer personal financial-planning services separate from similar services that may be offered as an adjunct to accounting services.</p>

<p>This designation is particularly useful for accountants who wish to focus their practice on individual and family planning. Usually, such practitioners will not actually engage in the execution of investment strategies recommended in the planning process.</p>
