<h1>SEC Form 40-F</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Registration and Annual Report for Canadian Securities Form. It is used by Canadian companies wishing to offer their securities to U.S. investors. In addition to the standard information included on this form describing the security and the company, it also provides domestic and Canadian contact information for the issuer.</p>

<p>Due to its proximity to the U.S. and the number of companies operating on both sides of the border, many Canadian companies want to make their securities available to U.S. investors. SEC Form 40-F is used to register Canadian securities in the U.S. and can provide valuable insight into Canadian companies. After the initial filing, SEC Form 40-F is also used by Canadian companies to provide their annual report.</p>
