<h1>Payback Period</h1>

<p>The length of time required to recover the cost of an investment. The payback period of a given investment or project is an important determinant of whether to undertake the position or project, as longer payback periods are typically not desirable for investment positions.</p>

<p>Calculated as:</p>

<p><b>Payback Period = Cost of Project / Annual Cash Inflows</b></p>

<p>All other things being equal, the better investment is the one with the shorter payback period. For example, if a project costs $100,000 and is expected to return $20,000 annually, the payback period will be $100,000/$20,000, or five years. There are two main problems with the payback period method:
1. It ignores any benefits that occur after the payback period and, therefore, does not measure profitability.</p>

<p>2. It ignores the time value of money.</p>

<p>Because of these reasons, other methods of capital budgeting, like net present value, internal rate of return or discounted cash flow, are generally preferred.</p>
