<h1>Physical Option</h1>

<p>An option that is based on a physical asset. Physical options give the owner the right to buy or sell physical assets at a predetermined price and date. They are called "physical" because they are based on assets such as currencies, Treasury debts and commodities, rather than stocks, futures and indexes.</p>

<p>As with any other type of option, you can purchase a call or put. You have the right to "call in," or buy, a physical asset by owning a physical call option; you have the right to "put out," or sell, a physical asset by owning a physical put option.</p>

<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) trades physical options that represent underlying assets such as gold or electricity.</p>
