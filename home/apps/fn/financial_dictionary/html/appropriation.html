<h1>Appropriation</h1>

<p>1. The act of setting aside money for a specific purpose. A company or a government appropriates funds in order to delegate cash for the necessities of its business operations. This may occur for any of the functions of a business, including setting aside funds for employee salaries, research and development, dividends and all other uses of cash. Federal funds must be appropriated each year for government programs.</p>

<p>In business use, may also be known as "capital allocation."</p>

<p>2. The claiming of land or intellectual property by a company or organization, or otherwise marking ownership of previously unclaimed or contested property.</p>

<p>By getting a clear picture of how a company appropriates its funds, an investor may have a better idea of how it manages cash. This is important in figuring out whether a company uses cash in order to build shareholder value, or whether its frivolous use of cash may lead to destruction of shareholder value.</p>
