<h1>SEC Form F-N</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required by foreign issuers to appoint an agent for making a public offering in the United States. SEC Form F-N must be filed by foreign banks, insurance companies and their subsidiaries. If the foreign issuer has already filed an SEC Form F-X, it is exempt from having to file this form under the Securities Act of 1933. Issuers are also exempt from having to file Form F-N if they are issuing debt securities or non-voting preferred shares.</p>

<p>Form F-N is also known as the Appointment of Agent for Service of Process by Foreign Banks and Foreign Insurance Companies under the Securities Act of 1933. This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
