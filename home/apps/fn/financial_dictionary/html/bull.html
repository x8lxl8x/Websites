<h1>Bull</h1>

<p>An investor who thinks the market, a specific security or an industry will rise. Investors who takes a bull approach will purchase securities under the assumption that they can be sold later at a higher price.</p>

<p>A "bear" is considered to be the opposite of a bull. Bear investors believe that the value of a specific security or an industry is likely to decline in the future.</p>

<p>Bulls are optimistic investors who are presently predicting good things for the market, and are attempting to profit from this upward movement.</p>

<p>For example, if you are bullish on the S&P 500, you will attempt to profit from a rise in the index by "going long" on it. Bears, in comparison, are pessimistic and believe that a particular security, commodity or entity will suffer a decline in price.</p>

<p>Bullishness does not necessarily apply only to the stock market; you could, for example, be bullish on just about anything, including real estate or commodities, like soy beans, crude oil or even peanuts.</p>
