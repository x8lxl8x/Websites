<h1>Soft Sell</h1>

<p>Advertising and sales practices denoted by subtle language and a non-aggressive technique. A soft sell is designed to avoid angering potential customers and pushing them away. Because soft selling is a low-pressure sales technique, it may not result in a sale the first time a product is presented.</p>

<p>Using a soft sell technique does not mean that a salesperson is passive; rather, this technique is designed to push a product without coming off as pushy. A salesperson may use a more conversational approach in order to allow the potential customer to relax. Just as with the hard sell, the soft sell requires a certain amount of energy on the part of the salesperson, since he or she has to maintain the customer's attention.</p>
