<h1>Print</h1>

<p>The execution of a trade. The term print originates from the ticker tape where trades would be listed, or printed,<i> </i>as they were executed.</p>

<p>The term print can also refer to a technical analysis chart that shows the price activity of a certain trading instrument. These charts can be time-based, as with a five-minute chart, or activity based, such as a 144-tick chart. Regardless of the data interval, each bar prints as it forms and becomes printed at the end of the selected date interval.</p>

<p>The term print can refer to the execution of a trade or the "drawing" of a price bar, such as a candlestick or OHLC, also known as an "Open, High, Low, Close" bar. Traders and investors can choose if they want to establish a position as soon as price reaches a specified level, or after the price bar prints, once the price level is reached. Some strategies also involve entering a trade at the beginning of the next bar, once a bar is printed where the trigger occurred, for example, where price was met.</p>
