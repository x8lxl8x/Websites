<h1>Amount Financed</h1>

<p>The actual amount of credit made available to a borrower in a loan, as defined by Regulation Z disclosure requirements of the Truth In Lending Act. Specifically, it is the amount of the loan principal, less prepaid finance charges (loan origination fees, so-called points, adjusted interest, etc.) and any required deposit balance. The amount financed is used to calculate the annual percentage rate.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Truth In Lending Act, passed in 1968, is to standardize the disclosures made to borrowers concerning the terms of a loan, most notably in the way costs are calculated. The Act prescribes that a Truth In Lending Disclosure Statement - which includes the amount financed - be provided to the consumer within three days of applying for a loan. The Statement enables borrowers to compare the costs of loans among different lenders.</p>
