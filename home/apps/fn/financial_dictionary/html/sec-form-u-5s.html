<h1>SEC Form U-5S</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be filed annually by every registered holding company. The form had to contain information on the parent holding company and all statutory subsidiaries, number of common shares owned, percentage of voting power and book value of shares, as well as summaries of acquisitions, sales, officers and directors, contributions, contracts, and financial statements. The SEC used this information to monitor the holdings, financings and operations of the registered public utility system.</p>

<p>Form U-5S, which is also known as an "annual report," was required under section five, rule one of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which was repealed on August 8, 2005, with the passing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The act regulated the holding companies of electric and natural gas utilities. Since the act was repealed, this form is now obsolete.</p>
