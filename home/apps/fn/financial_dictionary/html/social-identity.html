<h1>Social Identity</h1>

<p>A company's image as derived from its relationships. An organization's social identity comes from the groups that organization belongs to or is affiliated with, the way it is structured, the industry it belongs to and other social factors. A company's social identity will impact how it is perceived by consumers, so social identity affects a company's bottom line and should be closely managed.</p>

<p>For example, whether a public company trades on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange could be considered part of that company's social identity. Social identity can also refer specifically to a company's image as portrayed through social networking websites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. When someone falsely impersonates an individual or company online, it is considered social identity theft.</p>
