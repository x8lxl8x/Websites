<h1>International Association Of Financial Engineers - IAFE</h1>

<p>A not-for-profit, professional society dedicated to promoting the field of quantitative finance by providing platforms to discuss current and fundamental issues in the profession. The International Association of Financial Engineers was founded in 1992 and is comprised of academics and professionals from banks, broker dealers, hedge funds, pension funds, asset managers, technology firms, regulators, accounting, consulting and law firms, and universities worldwide.</p>

<p>Members of the IAFE have access to members-only content on the organization's web site; access to IAFE Committees (area-specific initiatives to discuss policy issues in depth, including investor risk, operational risk, technology and education); attendance to IAFE evening forums; and discounts to certain industry journals and IAFE endorsed conferences.</p>

<p>Financial engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that utilizes computational intelligence, mathematical finance and statistical modeling, to analyze and predict market activity in order to make more informed investing, trading and hedging decisions. Risk management is a key aspect of financial engineering and practitioners attempt to calculate the financial risk posed by specific investments. Financial engineers are often referred to as "quants" because of the quantitative skills required of the profession. Financial engineers are typically well-versed in the C++ programming language and math subfields, including stochastic calculus, multivariate calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability theory and statistical inference.</p>

<p>Also called computational finance.</p>
