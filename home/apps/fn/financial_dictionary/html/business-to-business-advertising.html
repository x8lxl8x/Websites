<h1>Business-To-Business Advertising</h1>

<p>Marketing efforts directed toward other businesses rather to individual consumers. Business-to-business advertising may involve the promotion of products such as copier machines, or services such as human resources consulting or logistics, that are primarily designed for businesses.</p>

<p>While business-to-consumer advertising focuses on reaching a household's decision-maker, business-to-business advertising focuses on reaching the employees of a business responsible for making capital decisions or who are in charge of purchasing. While consumers may be able to make rapid decisions on whether a product is of interest, businesses are often slower and have to go through a more complex process because the cost of products for a business can be high and may require approval from several levels of management.</p>
