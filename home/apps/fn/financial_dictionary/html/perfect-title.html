<h1>Perfect Title</h1>

<p>A title deed for real estate that does not have any liens attached to it. A perfect title becomes so after all liens or other defects have been removed. Perfect titles stand in contrast to quiet titles or cloud on titles.</p>

<p>Perfect titles can also sometimes be referred to as "good titles."</p>

<p>Most properties are bought and sold with perfect or good titles. It is often necessary to perform a title search to find out the past owners of a property to make sure no other interests in the property exist. Perfecting a title is the process of clearing all prior claims on a title to allow for its sale or assignment.</p>
