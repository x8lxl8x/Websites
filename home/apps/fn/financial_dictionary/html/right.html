<h1>Rights</h1>

<p>A security giving stockholders entitlement to purchase new shares issued by the corporation at a predetermined price (normally at a discount to the current market price) in proportion to the number of shares already owned. Rights are issued only for a short period of time, after which they expire.</p>

<p>Also known as "subscription rights" or "share purchase rights."</p>

<p>Rights can and do trade independently of the underlying stock on an exchange. Similar to options, the price of a right is determined by a number of factors, such as its subscription price, the underlying stock price, its volatility, interest rates and time to expiration. The intrinsic or theoretical value of a right during the cum rights period - when the stock trades with the rights attached - is different from the value of a right during the ex-rights period, when it trades independently.</p>
