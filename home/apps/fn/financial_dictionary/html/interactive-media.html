<h1>Interactive Media</h1>

<p>A method of communication in which the program's outputs depend on the user's inputs, and the user's inputs in turn affect the program's outputs. Interactive media engage the user and interact with him or her in a way that non-interactive media do not. Websites and video games are two common types of interactive media. Movies and most TV shows are generally not considered interactive media; however, shows that require audience participation could be considered interactive media.</p>

<p>Social networking websites are an example of interactive media. The sites use graphics and text to allow users to share photos and information about themselves, chat and play games. Video games are another type of interactive media. Players use controllers to respond to visual and sound cues on the screen that are generated by a computer program.</p>
