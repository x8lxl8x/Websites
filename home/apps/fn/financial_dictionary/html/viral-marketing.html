<h1>Viral Marketing</h1>

<p>Internet advertising or marketing that spreads exponentially whenever a new user is added. Viral marketing assumes that as each new user starts using the service or product, the advertising will go to everyone with whom that user interacts.</p>

<p>An example of viral marketing is Hotmail, which offers free web-based email. Each time a user emails someone, there is an embedded advertisement to the recipient to sign up for a Hotmail account. While the practice was much more widely used in the early to mid-2000s as new internet businesses were being created in extreme numbers, it is still common among internet based business-to-consumer (B to C) companies.</p>
