<h1>Graduated Payment Mortgage</h1>

<p>A type of fixed-rate mortgage in which the payment increases gradually from an initial low base level to a desired, final level. Typically, the payments will grow 7-12% annually from their initial base payment amount until the full payment is reached.</p>

<p>In a graduated payment mortgage, only the low initial rate is used to qualify the buyer, which allows many people who might not otherwise qualify for a mortgage to own a home. This type of mortgage payment system may be optimal for young homeowners as their income levels gradually rise to meet higher mortgage payments.</p>
