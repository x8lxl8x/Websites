<h1>Bleeding Edge Technology</h1>

<p>Technology that is acquired almost immediately after its release, regardless of the increased cost or risk involved. Bleeding edge technology is most popular among innovators and early adopters, and is often seen as related to terms "leading edge" and "cutting edge." However, bleeding edge technology suggests that a greater degree of risk is involved for the consumer who adopts it. This risk could be from limited support, uncaught problems, compatability issues and so on.</p>

<p>An example of bleeding edge technology would be the new smartphones that people take the day off from work to stand in line-ups for. After purchase, there may be fewer applications, major problems and limited support. Apple's iPhone 4 was bleeding edge technology for many users, and it came with some risks that included an antenna issue and some operating system glitches. These issues are usually addressed within months of the release of bleeding edge technology.</p>
