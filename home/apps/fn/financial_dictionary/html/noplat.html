<h1>Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes - NOPLAT</h1>

<p>A financial metric that calculates a firm's operating profits after adjusting for taxes. By using operating income, or income before taking interest payments into account, NOPLAT is a better indicator of operating efficiency than net income, for example. NOPLAT is used extensively in mergers and acquisitions because it enables the calculation of an investment's free cash flow.</p>

<p>NOPLAT for a firm is calculated as Operating Income x (1 - Tax Rate). For example, a firm with $250,000 in operating income and a tax rate of 30% would have NOPLAT of $175,000.  NOPLAT is also used to calculate Economic Value Added or EVA: a measure of management performance to compare economic profit to the total cost of capital.</p>
