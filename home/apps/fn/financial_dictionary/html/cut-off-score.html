<h1>Cut-Off Score</h1>

<p>The lowest possible credit score one can have and still qualify for a loan. Anyone with a score below the cut-off score is usually rejected. Of course, the lender can still approve the loan if it so desires with an override approval. Anyone with a credit score above this level is usually approved.</p>

<p>The cut-off score will differ from one type of loan to another, as well as between lenders. Some home loans require a minimum FICO score of 620, while others may accept scores less than 620 (subprime territory). Cut-off scores are generally lower for credit card applications and other high-interest loans.</p>
