<h1>Corporate Governance Quotient - CGQ</h1>

<p>A metric developed by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that rates publicly traded companies in terms of the quality of their corporate governance. Each public company covered by the metric is assigned a rating based on a number of factors that are considered by the ISS model. Factors used in the CGQ formula include board structure and composition, the executive and director compensation charter, and bylaw provisions.</p>

<p>The CGQ serves as a reasonable approximation of the quality of a public firm's corporate governance. Investors seeking to hold shares in a company for the long term will typically be concerned about the quality of their company's corporate governance, as research has shown that a high quality of corporate governance typically leads to enhanced shareholder returns.</p>
