<h1>Debtonation</h1>

<p>A financial blog that documents the financial crisis that began in the late 2000s as a result of the subprime mortgage meltdown. The blog, at <a href='www.debtonation.org.html'>www.debtonation.org</a>, is run by Ann Pettifor, an economist who claims to have predicted the crisis back in 2003.</p>

<p>Among other accomplishments, Pettifor is a fellow of the New Economics Foundation, a U.K.-based think tank focused on social justice, environmental sustainability and collective well-being. She is also the co-author of "The Green New Deal", a book about the relationship between the financial crisis, climate change and oil depletion.</p>
