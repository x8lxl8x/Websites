<h1>Dedicated Portfolio</h1>

<p>A passive form of portfolio management that involves the matching of future cash inflows with future liabilities. The process of dedicating a portfolio may be used as an alternative to multiperiod immunization, which reduces the level of interest rate risk to which a portfolio is exposed.</p>

<p>Because the portfolio is usually made up of investment-grade instruments, there is generally no need to rebalance it. Additionally, the payments are virtually guaranteed, as there is a low level of default risk associated with investment-grade instruments.</p>

<p>An example of a dedicated portfolio strategy could involve a pension fund that will begin making payment distributions to plan members in five years' time. To immunize this cash outflow, which is a liability to the pension fund, the fund could purchase five-year government bonds.</p>
