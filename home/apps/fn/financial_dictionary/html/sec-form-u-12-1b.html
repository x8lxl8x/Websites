<h1>SEC Form U-12-1B</h1>

<p>A statement that was required to be filed annually with the SEC regarding the actions of employees of registered holding companies. The SEC Form U-12-1B follows form U-12-1A, which listed all employees of holding companies. Both forms were required by Section 12 (1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935. As a result of the repeal of PUHCA in 2006, Forms U-12-1B and U-12-1A are now obsolete.</p>

<p>Following the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s, a number of antitrust measures and securities laws were introduced to forestall a repeat of these events. One of these antitrust measures was PUHCA, which was enacted in 1935 to regulate the electric utilities industry and curb its power, as the eight largest utility holding companies controlled almost 75% of the industry. PUHCA remained in effect in most of its original form for more than 55 years, until it was reformed by the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992. After the introduction of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, PUHCA was repealed in February 2006.</p>
