<h1>Bullet Bond</h1>

<p>A debt instrument whose entire face value is paid at once on the maturity date. Bullet bonds are non-callable. Bullet bonds cannot be redeemed early by an issuer, so they pay a relatively low rate of interest because of the issuer's exposure to interest-rate risk. Both corporations and governments issue bullet bonds, and bullet bonds come in a variety of maturities, from short- to long-term. A portfolio made up of bullet bonds is called a bullet portfolio.</p>

<p>A bullet bond is considered riskier than an amortizing bond because it gives the issuer a large repayment obligation on a single date rather than a series of smaller repayment obligations spread over several dates. As a result, issuers who are relatively new to the market or who have less than excellent credit ratings may attract more investors with an amortizing bond than with a bullet bond.</p>
