<h1>Hyperdeflation</h1>

<p>An extremely large and relatively quick level of deflation in an economy. Hyperdeflation occurs when the general price level of goods or services in an economy falls drastically in a short period of time, causing the real value of a currency to actually increase in that time. This increase results in debts being more pronounced as the real value increases and the value of the currency falls.</p>

<p>While there are no official definitions of what price levels must fall to and how quickly for deflation to be defined as hyperdeflation, generally hyperdeflation can lead to a deflationary spiral in which a deflationary environment leads to lower production, lower wages and demand, and thus lower price levels, continuing until an outside force (government for example) steps in.</p>
