<h1>Tax Fairness</h1>

<p>A tax platform based on an ideal that aims to create a system of taxation that is fair, clear and equivalent for all taxpayers. Overall, tax fairness looks to limit the amount of tax legislation and rules that benefit one segment of the tax-paying population over another.</p>

<p>Many groups, politicians and individuals that push for tax fairness are looking to remove loopholes, incentives and cheating within the tax system. Tax fairness supporters believe these practices place an undue tax burden on certain segments of the tax-paying population, while making it easy for other segments to significantly lower their tax burdens.</p>
