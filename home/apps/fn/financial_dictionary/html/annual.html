<h1>Annual</h1>

<p>An event that occurs once a year. Annual events or reports may include taxes, shareholder meetings and corporate filings, such as a 10-K. These types of announcements are in contrast to those reported quarterly, such as a 10-Q. Other significant events that occur on an annual basis, include annual fees and annual compounding events.</p>

<p>Filings and strategy sessions that occur once a year typically involve a level of forecasting, with a company identifying what it expects to earn or what it expects to do over the course of the next twelve months. The company may keep investors up to date with progress through quarterly reports.</p>
