<h1>Mine And Yours</h1>

<p>Terms used by floor traders to signify buying and selling. If a trader wanted to buy something, they would type or say "Mine," as in "It's mine." If the trader wanted to sell, they would type or say "Yours," as in "It's yours." These terms are mainly used in forex transactions.</p>

<p>The forex or foreign exchange market is a highly liquid market where investors such as individuals, financial institutions, corporations, central banks and hedge funds trade currencies, usually through the Internet. This market relies heavily on leverage because currency pairs usually experience very small changes in value on a day-to-day basis. When a forex investor opens a trade, they are buying one currency and selling another. To close the trade, they do the opposite transaction.</p>
