<h1>Hazard Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance that protects a property owner against damage caused by fires, severe storms, earthquakes or other natural events. As long as the specific event is covered within the policy, the property owner will receive compensation to cover the cost of any damage incurred. Typically, the property owner will be required to pay for a year's worth of premiums at the time of closing, but this will depend on the exact details of the policy.</p>

<p>A typical property or homeowners' insurance policy usually won't cover all events that could do damage to your property. Some events will definitely be excluded from homeowners' insurance in high-risk areas. For example, Florida is prone to hurricanes and is, therefore, considered high risk. If the homeowner lives in a high-risk area, he or she may need a separate policy - such as a flood insurance policy.</p>
