<h1>Power Broker</h1>

<p>An individual who, through his or her connections, is able to influence the decisions of other parties. A power broker is typically an industry insider, and is familiar with other individuals and groups able to exert influence or make decisions. Power brokers may be elected officials, business leaders or individuals who are "connected".</p>

<p>Because of the influence power brokers have on an organization's decision makers, they are able to command high fees and the attention of individuals, organizations and companies looking to make headway with a particular project or goal. For example, industry lobbyists and media personnel familiar with the ins and outs of a particular issue are able to reach and influence decision makers faster than those who are unfamiliar with key players.</p>
