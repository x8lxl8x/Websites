<h1>Automated Underwriting</h1>

<p>A computer-generated loan underwriting decision. Using completed loan application information, an automated underwriting systems retrieves relevant data, such as a borrower's credit history, and arrives at a logic-based loan decision. Some applications may be referred to manual underwriting, and some inputs - such as income and assets - must be verified at a later date.</p>

<p>Automated underwriting engines can provide near-instantaneous loan approval or denial decisions; therefore, implementing automated underwriting systems can save a considerable amount of time, as manual underwriting can take as long as 60 days to complete.</p>

<p>In addition to the time savings, automated underwriting is preferred because it is based on algorithms, eliminating human bias. Freddie Mac maintains and markets a large automated underwriting engine known as Loan Prospector, and Fannie Mae has an automated underwriting engine known as Desktop Underwriter.</p>
