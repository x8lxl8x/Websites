<h1>Conspicuous Consumption</h1>

<p>The purchase of goods or services for the specific purpose of displaying one's wealth. Conspicuous consumption is a means to show ones social status, especially when the goods and services publicly displayed are too expensive for other members of a person's class. This type of consumption is typically associated with the wealthy but can also apply to any economic class. The concept of consumerism stems from conspicuous consumption.</p>

<p>The term was coined by American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen in his 1889 book, "The Theory of the Leisure Class." This type of consumption was considered to be a product of the developing middle class during the 19th and 20th centuries. This group had a greater percentage of disposable income to spend on goods and services that were generally not considered to be necessary.</p>
