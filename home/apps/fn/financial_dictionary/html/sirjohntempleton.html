<h1>Sir John Templeton</h1>

<p>An investor considered by many to be one of the greatest investors and mutual fund managers of all time. Sir John Templeton (1912-2008) founded the Templeton Growth Fund in 1954, which was one of the first U.S. mutual funds to embrace global investing. He is best known for his focus on the fundamental analysis of stocks and contrarian investing style, as well as his amazing sense of philanthropy.</p>

<p>The life of Sir John Templeton was one of stark contrasts that is a must read for any serious scholar of investing. Similar to Warren Buffet, Templeton lived a life of relative frugality despite his accumulation of a vast fortune. Though born in the U.S., he renounced his U.S. citizenship in the late 1960s to avoid paying income taxes on his growing fortune. This controversial decision set the stage for him later being knighted as a naturalized British citizen.</p>
