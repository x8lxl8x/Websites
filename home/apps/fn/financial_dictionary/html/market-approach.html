<h1>Market Approach</h1>

<p>A method of determining the appraisal value of an asset based on the selling price of similar items. The market approach is a business valuation method that can be used to calculate the value of property or as part of the valuation process for a closely held business. Additionally, the market approach can be used to determine the value of a business ownership interest, security or intangible asset. Regardless of what asset is being valued, the market approach studies recent sales of similar assets, making adjustments for differences in size, quantity or quality.</p>

<p>In the real estate industry, a property's value can be estimated by looking at the comparables: recently sold properties that are similar in size and features that are located within a close geographic proximity to the property being valued. Outlier transactions, indicative of particularly motivated buyers or sellers, may need to be compensated for since the price may not adequately reflect the fair market value.</p>
