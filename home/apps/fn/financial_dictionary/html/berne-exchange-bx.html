<h1>Berne Exchange - BX</h1>

<p>One of two stock exchanges in Berne. The Berne Exchange is much smaller than the Swiss Exchange, which dominates share trading in Switzerland. The exchange was formally set up in 1884 and is managed by the Berne Stock Exchange Association. It is also known by its abbreviation BX.</p>

<p>The Berne Exchange aims to attract listings of Swiss small and medium-sized enterprises, which typically are unable to meet the more stringent listing criteria of the Swiss Exchange. It introduced a fully electronic trading platform in 2002.</p>
