<h1>Seed Stock</h1>

<p>An investment security that is based on shares of a publicly traded, agriculture-based company that is involved in plant research and development. A seed stock is any stock that represents a company that researches and produces seeds for planting crops and develops new seed products to increase farmers' yields or otherwise improve seed performance.</p>

<p>Some seed companies are more involved with traditional agriculture, while others seek to develop new seed technology and are therefore in the crop-biotechnology industry. Examples of seed stocks include Monsanto Company, Origin Agritch Limited and Syngenta AG.</p>
