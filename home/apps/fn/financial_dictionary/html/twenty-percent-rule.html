<h1>Twenty Percent Rule</h1>

<p>A deposit requirement instituted by commercial banks for corporate lenders. The twenty percent rule stipulates that borrowers must keep deposits at the bank that are at least equal to 20% of their regular borrowings from their line of credit. However, the exact ratio of this rule is often contingent upon current interest rates and other factors.</p>

<p>The twenty percent rule is also known as a compensating balance. These balances are not usually fixed at a set percentage, such as 20%, the way they used to be. They now tend to range anywhere from 10-25%, and are sometimes even waived with the payment of bank service charges.</p>
