<h1>Acquittance</h1>

<p>A document that shows that a debtor has been released from a debt obligation. An acquittance are often given as an indication from the lender to a debtor that the owed amount has been completely repaid and that the lender cannot request further repayment on that specific debt.</p>

<p>Banks and other mortgage lenders often issue some form of an acquittance once a mortgagor makes a final payment toward his or her mortgage. This provides the borrower with an official statement that the loan has been repaid in full.</p>
