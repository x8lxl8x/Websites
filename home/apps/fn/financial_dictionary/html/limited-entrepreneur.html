<h1>Limited Entrepreneur</h1>

<p>A person who is involved in a limited liability company but does not actively manage it. One benefit of being a limited entrepreneur is not having to pay self-employment tax. LLC owners must be careful to not allocate more than 35% of the LLC's losses to limited entrepreneurs, otherwise the LLC would be classified as a syndicate and face different tax treatment.</p>

<p>Limited partners are similar to limited entrepreneurs in that they also do not play an active role in a company's management and cannot be held responsible for any debts the company incurs. This means that any income or losses they receive from the business are usually considered passive for tax purposes.</p>
