<h1>Currency ETF</h1>

<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in a single currency or basket of currencies. Currency ETFs aim to replicate movements in currency in the foreign exchange market by holding currencies either directly or through currency-denominated short-term debt instruments.</p>

<p>Currency ETFs are widely used by investors who wish to gain exposure to the foreign exchange market and would prefer not to enter the futures or forex markets. With the growing popularity of ETFs, investors have found it very easy and relatively inexpensive to trade currency ETFs in order to take advantage of fluctuations between currencies. Currency ETFs can be purchased to track most international currencies including the U.S. and Canadian dollars, the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen.</p>
