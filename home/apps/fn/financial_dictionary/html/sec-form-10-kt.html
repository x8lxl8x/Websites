<h1>SEC Form 10-KT</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is submitted in lieu of or in addition to a standard 10-K annual report when a company changes its fiscal year-end. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's business activities. Companies return to filing a standard 10-K report once the transition to the new fiscal year is complete.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons that a company may choose to change its fiscal year-end including: to be consistent with the reporting periods of their industry peers, to coincide with the tax year of their investors and to align its business cycle more closely with its customers. The requirement to file a transitional 10-K report is covered by Rules 13a-10 and 15d-10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
