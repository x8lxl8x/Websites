Where:
M = money supply
V = velocity of money
P = average price level of goods
T = index of expenditures (such as the total number of economic transactions)</p>

<p>The equation of exchange has two primary uses. It represents a founding principle used by the quantity theory of money, which relates increases in the money supply to increases in the overall level of prices. Additionally, solving the equation for 'M' can serve as an indicator of the demand for money.</p>
