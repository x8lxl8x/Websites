<p>2. Brother or sister (includes stepbrothers/stepsisters and half-brothers/half-sisters)</p>

<p>3. Lineal ancestor (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent; step-lineal ancestors are included)</p>

<p>4. Niece, nephew, aunt or uncle (not including relations by marriage)</p>

<p>5. In-law (father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law)</p>
