<h1>Legacy Asset</h1>

<p>An asset that has been on the company's books for a long period of time. This type of asset has generally decreased in value to the point of a loss for the company. The term comes from the literal meaning of outdate or obsolete.</p>

<p>While these assets are generally considered a hinderance, it may be a good time to take another look at them in times of economic downturn. It is possible that they may have new value in a different time or economy. Conversely, it may also be a good time to sell the assets at a reduced price, simply to earn enough money to remain afloat during a recession.</p>
