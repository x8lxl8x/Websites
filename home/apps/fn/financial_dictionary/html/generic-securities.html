<h1>Generic Securities</h1>

<p>A security backed by recently issued loans or mortgages. Its value is less than that of a security whose backing is over one year old. Securities over a year old are called seasoned securities.</p>

<p>A generic security does not yet have a history that potential investors can look to for past performance rating as a seasoned security does. However, as they are valued less by investors, generic securities are less expensive to purchase.</p>
