<h1>Requisition</h1>

<p>A formal request. Shareholders can issue a requisition notice to a company requiring it to put resolutions to a vote. In business, one department of a company might submit a requisition to the purchasing department for supplies it wants to order. In healthcare, a doctor might issue a requisition for a laboratory test to be performed on a patient to ensure that the patient or his insurance will be responsible for paying for the test.</p>

<p>In a purchase requisition, an employee would submit a requisition form containing information such as the date of the request, the department submitting the request, the person submitting the request, the items requested and the location where the order, if approved, should be delivered. If approved, the purchase order, packing slip and invoice may be attached to the purchase requisition for recordkeeping purposes.</p>
