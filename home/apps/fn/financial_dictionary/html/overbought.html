<h1>Overbought</h1>

<p>1. A situation in which the demand for a certain asset unjustifiably pushes the price of an underlying asset to levels that do not support the fundamentals.</p>

<p>2. In technical analysis, this term describes a situation in which the price of a security has risen to such a degree - usually on high volume - that an oscillator has reached its upper bound. This is generally interpreted as a sign that the price of the asset is becoming overvalued and may experience a pullback.</p>

<p>1. An asset that has experienced sharp upward movements over a very short period of time is often deemed to be overbought. Determining the degree in which an asset is overbought is very subjective and can differ between investors.</p>

<p>2. Technicians use indicators such as the relative strength index, the stochastic oscillator or the money flow index to identify securities that are becoming overbought.</p>

<p>An overbought security is the opposite of one that is oversold.</p>
