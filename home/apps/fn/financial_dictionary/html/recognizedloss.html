<h1>Recognized Loss</h1>

<p>When an investment or asset is sold for less than its purchase price. Recognized losses may be reported for income tax purposes and then carried over into future periods.</p>

<p>Recognized capital losses can be used for effective tax planning strategies. For example, if an investor has taxable capital gains for a given year of $10,500 and is able to recognize a loss on another investment for $2,500, this loss can be applied against the taxable capital gains. Therefore, this investor's net taxable capital gains for the year are $8,000 rather then $10,500.</p>
