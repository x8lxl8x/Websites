<h1>SEC Form 424B1</h1>

<p>The prospectus form that a company must file to provide additional information that was not included in its initial prospectus filing upon registration. Companies are required to file prospectus form 424B1 in accordance with SEC Rule 424(b)(1) per the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.</p>

<p>The Securities Exchange Act of 1933 was created to help investors make informed decisions by requiring securities issuers to complete and file registration statements (including financial and material information) with the SEC before making an issue available for purchase by the public.  Often registration statement filings required under the 1933 Act are also registered statements under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</p>
