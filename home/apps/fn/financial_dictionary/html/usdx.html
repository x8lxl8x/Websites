<h1>U.S. Dollar Index - USDX</h1>

<p>A measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to majority of its most significant trading partners. This index is similar to other trade-weighted indexes, which also use the exchange rates from the same major currencies.</p>

<p>Currently, this index is calculated by factoring in the exchange rates of six major world currencies: the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. This index started in 1973 with a base of 100 and is relative to this base. This means that a value of 120 would suggest that the U.S. dollar experienced a 20% increase in value over the time period.</p>

<p>It is possible to incorporate futures or options strategies on the USDX. These financial products currently trade on the New York Board Of Trade.</p>
