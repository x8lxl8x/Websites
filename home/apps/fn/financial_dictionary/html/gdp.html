<h1>Gross Domestic Product - GDP</h1>

<p>The monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis. It includes all of private and public consumption, government outlays, investments and exports less imports that occur within a defined territory.</p>

<p><b>GDP = C + G + I + NX</b></p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>"<b>C</b>" is equal to all private consumption, or consumer spending, in a nation's economy
"<b>G</b>" is the sum of government spending
"<b>I</b>" is the sum of all the country's businesses spending on capital
"<b>NX</b>" is the nation's total net exports, calculated as total exports minus total imports. (NX = Exports - Imports)
GDP is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country, as well as to gauge a country's standard of living. Critics of using GDP as an economic measure say the statistic does not take into account the underground economy - transactions that, for whatever reason, are not reported to the government. Others say that GDP is not intended to gauge material well-being, but serves as a measure of a nation's productivity, which is unrelated.</p>
