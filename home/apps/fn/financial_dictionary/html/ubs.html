<h1>UBS</h1>

<p>A multinational diversified financial services company headquartered in Switzerland. UBS is involved in virtually all major financial activities, including retail and commercial banking, investment banking, investment management and wealth management. UBS has a major presence in the United States and has its American headquarters in New York City.</p>

<p>The name UBS is derived from one of its predecessor corporations, the Union Bank of Switzerland. The current UBS was formed when the Union Bank of Switzerland merged with the Swiss Bank Corporation. Thus, UBS is now used as the company name, not as an acronym. The UBS logo consists of three keys, a symbol taken from the Swiss Bank Corporation. The keys symbolize confidence, security and discretion.</p>
