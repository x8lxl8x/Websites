<h1>Revenue Ruling</h1>

<p>A decree issued by the IRS that essentially has the force of law. A revenue ruling outlines the IRS's interpretation of the tax laws and is binding on all IRS employees. Revenue rulings are published in the Cumulative Bulletin and are issued only from the National Office of the IRS.</p>

<p>Taxpayers and tax professionals can use revenue rulings as reliable guidelines for their own returns or the returns of their clients. Those who ignore the stipulations outlined in a revenue ruling can be subject to additional taxation, penalty or other disciplinary action.</p>
