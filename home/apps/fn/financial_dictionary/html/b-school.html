<h1>B-School</h1>

<p>Abbreviation of business school, an educational institution that focuses on teaching business-related courses. While business schools may offer courses ranging from undergraduate degrees to postdoctoral programs, their prime offering is the Master of Business Administration (MBA)  program. Top-tier business schools are usually renowned for the high quality of their graduates, many of whom climb the corporate ladder steadily to eventually become among the highest ranking executives in their organizations.</p>

<p>A business school's curriculum will include subjects such as finance, marketing, statistics and operations management. Despite the spiraling costs of obtaining a business degree, demand for B-school degrees remains high. Some of the top business schools such as Harvard, Wharton and London Business School attract thousands of qualified candidates every year, resulting in very high competition.</p>
