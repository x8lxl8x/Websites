<h1>Excess Kurtosis</h1>

<p>A statistical term describing that a probability, or return distribution, has a kurtosis coefficient that is larger then the coefficient associated with a normal distribution, which is around 3. This will signal that the probability of obtaining an extreme value in the future is higher than a lower level of kurtosis.</p>

<p>Kurtosis is a measure of the likelihood that an event occurring is extreme in relation to a given distribution.</p>

<p>Excess kurtosis is an important consideration to take when examining historical returns from a stock or portfolio, for example. The higher the kurtosis coefficient is above the "normal level", the more likely that future returns will be either extremely large or extremely small.</p>

<p>Kurtosis is often referred to the "volatility of volatility".</p>
