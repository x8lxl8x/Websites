<h1>Housing Expense Ratio</h1>

<p>A ratio comparing housing expenses to before-tax income that is used by lenders to qualify borrowers for a mortgage. The housing expense measure includes mortgage principal, interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance and association fees. The limit is generally 28%.</p>

<p>It is sometimes referred to as the "front ratio".</p>

<p>A housing expense ratio higher than the standard 28% may be acceptable to lenders based on compensating factors such as a low loan-to-value ratio and/or an excellent credit history. In addition, applying jointly with a co-borrower can lower a housing expense ratio, as can choosing certain mortgage products with initial low payments. However, some of these perks can add up to big debt later, so buyers should be wary.</p>
