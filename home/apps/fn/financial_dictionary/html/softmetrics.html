<h1>Soft Metrics</h1>

<p>A slang term for intangible indicators used to value a startup company (can be used for larger firms but hard metrics are preferred). Soft metrics are often related to aspects of a firm that cannot be easily measured but still provide important information in relation to the present and future prospects of a firm. Since soft metrics are not easily measured or identified, quantifying them can be quite difficult.</p>

<p>Soft metrics evaluate the things that aren't apparent but may help predict a company's future: are there heavy hitters on the board of directors? Has the management team succeeded before? In comparison to hard metrics, soft metrics can often provide an answer as to why hard metrics may be trending in a certain direction or to unexpected results. Examples of hard metrics would be contributing factors such as net profit margin and free cash flow.</p>
