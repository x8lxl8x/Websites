<h1>Admitted Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance purchased from a company that is admitted (or licensed) in the state in which the policy was sold. Admitted insurance must also be sold by an agent who is licensed in that state.</p>

<p>By contrast, many states will allow non-admitted carriers to transact business in their state where there is a special need that cannot or will not be met by admitted carriers. Non-admitted carriers are usually referred to as "surplus" or "excess lines insurers". Non-admitted carriers are not regulated in that state and do not contribute to the State Guaranty Fund, which protects policyholders from the bankruptcy of its insurance carrier.</p>

<p>Insurance purchased from these carriers is therefore riskier than doing business with admitted carriers and brokers must inform consumers if their insurance has been placed with a non-admitted insurer. Also, the purchaser and/or the insurance broker must provide a statement that it made a good faith effort to obtain the insurance from admitted carriers before seeking out a non-admitted carrier.</p>
