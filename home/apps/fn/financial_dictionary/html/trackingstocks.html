<h1>Tracking Stock</h1>

<p>1. Common stock issued by a parent company that tracks the performance of a particular division without having claim on the assets of the division or the parent company. Also known as "designer stock".</p>

<p>2. A type of security specifically designed to mirror the performance of a larger index.</p>

<p>1. When a parent company issues a tracking stock, all revenues and expenses of the applicable division are separated from the parent company's financial statements and bound to the tracking stock. Oftentimes, this is done to separate a subsidiary's high-growth division from a larger parent company that is presenting losses. The parent company and its shareholders, however, still control the operations of the subsidiary.</p>

<p>2. The most popular tracking stock is the QQQQ, which is an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the returns of the Nasdaq 100 index. Another type of tracking stock is Standard & Poor's depository receipts (SPDRs), which mirror the returns of the S&P 500 index.</p>
