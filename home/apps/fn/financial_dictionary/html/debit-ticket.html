<h1>Debit Ticket</h1>

<p>An accounting entry recorded as a debit that acknowledges money owed. When payment is received a corresponding credit is entered to cancel the debit.</p>

<p>An example is when a bank processes a check to be deposited into a customer's account.  The bank treats the check as a cash item and credits the funds to the customer's account and writes a debit ticket, charged to the general ledger, while waiting to receive payment from the bank account against which the check was written.</p>
