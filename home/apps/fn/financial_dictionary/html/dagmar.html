<h1>DAGMAR</h1>

<p>A marketing approach used to measure the results of an advertising campaign. DAGMAR is an acronym: <b>D</b>efining <b>A</b>dvertising <b>G</b>oals for <b>M</b>easured <b>A</b>dvertising <b>R</b>esults. The approach involves setting specific, measurable objectives for a campaign to determine if specific objectives were met. Specifically, DAGMAR seeks to communicate a specific message through four steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Awareness - making the consumer aware that the product or company exists</li>
<li>Comprehension - letting the consumer know what the product is used for</li>
<li>Conviction - convincing the consumer to purchase the product</li>
<li>Action - getting the consumer to actually make the purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>DAGMAR as an approach was first proposed by Russell Colley in a 1961 report to the Association of National Advertisers. Collay proposed that the real goal of advertising was to communicate, not to sell specifically. By determining if the consumer had sufficient knowledge of a product and its benefits by creating clear, specific objectives that are discussed within an advertisement, advertisers would be able to tell if their selling points made a difference in the consumer's decision-making process.</p>
