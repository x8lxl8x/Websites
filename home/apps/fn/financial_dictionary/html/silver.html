<h1>Silver</h1>

<p>An element commonly used in jewelry, coins, electronics and photography. Silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any metal and, thus, is seen as a highly valuable substance. In many global cultures and religions silver is used in traditional ceremonies and worn as jewelery during important occasions.</p>

<p>Silver, along with gold and other metals, is considered to be a precious metal. While the majority of press is given to price movements of gold in the global marketplace, silver is also viewed by many to hold key importance in understanding the potential movements of not only the commodities markets, but the overall marketplace as well. This is due to the fact that many traders trade silver based on global-macro trends.</p>
