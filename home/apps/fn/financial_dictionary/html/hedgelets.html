<h1>Hedgelet</h1>

<p>A simplified derivative instrument that allows investors to hedge or speculate on economic events such as housing prices, commodity prices, interest rates, currencies and economic indicators.</p>

<p>The price for a hedgelet contract is based on the prevailing market price determined by participants in the market. Every contract has the same defined payout scheme: $10 for a correct contract and $0 for an incorrect one. Each hedgelet contract is set so that investors must make a decision on whether an economic event will occur or not occur.</p>

<p>For example, on a "Crude Oil > $64" contract an investor can either choose Yes (oil will be more than $64 at expiration) or No (oil will be less than $64 at expiration). If the investor purchases one Yes "Crude Oil > $64" contract for $2, and crude oil ends at $80 when the contract expires, the investor will receive $10 - an $8 profit. However, if the price of crude oil ends at less than $64, the contract will be worthless and the investor will lose the initial $2 investment.</p>
