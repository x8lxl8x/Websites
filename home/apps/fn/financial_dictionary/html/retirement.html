<h1>Retirement</h1>

<p>When a person chooses to leave the workforce. The concept of full retirement - being able to permanently leave the workforce in old age - is relatively new, and for the most part only culturally-widespread in first-world countries. Many developed countries have some type of national pension or benefits system (i.e. the United States' Social Security system) to help supplement retirees' incomes.</p>

<p>Dramatic advances in healthcare have extended the lives of people in, predominantly, first-world and developed countries. That means that without adequate personal savings and/or pensions, people could easily outlive their retirement funds.  In times of economic downturn retirees may choose to "come out of retirement" and re-enter the workforce on a seasonal, part-time or full-time basis to earn income and obtain benefits, especially costly health insurance coverage.</p>
