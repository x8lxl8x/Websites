<h1>Incremental Marketing</h1>

<p>A gradual increase in advertising expenditures and product exposure over time. Incremental marketing requires a company to break up a long-term marketing plan into smaller components and assign milestones to each component that have to be met before further marketing funds are committed. The success of each of the components determines if the marketing campaign continues or is halted.</p>

<p>Incremental marketing as an overall strategy is helpful for companies that are not ready to jump into a large scale marketing campaign. It allows smaller companies to deploy funds as they become available and only if the company sees results from each step. It also is a useful strategy when promoting a product or service that is unfamliar to the consumer because of the greater risk of consumers rejecting the good.</p>
