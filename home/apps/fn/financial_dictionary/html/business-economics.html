<h1>Business Economics</h1>

<p>The study of the financial issues and challenges faced by corporations. Business economics is a field in economics that deals with issues such as business organization, management, expansion and strategy. Studies might include how and why corporations expand, the impact of entrepreneurs, the interactions between corporations and the role of governments in regulation.</p>

<p>Corporations make strategic decisions that can result in a profit or loss. Business economics studies how and why corporations make these decisions and how other economic factors can influence their choices. In the United States, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) is the professional association for business economists. The organization's mission is "to provide leadership in the use and understanding of economics." In the United Kingdom, the professional organization is the Society of Business Economists.</p>
