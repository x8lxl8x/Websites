<h1>The Government Pension Investment Fund (Japan)</h1>

<p>The pension fund for Japanese public sector employees. The GPIF pension fund is the largest in the world, with approximately $1.3 trillion (122 trillion yen) in assets under management as of 2009. The GPIF contributes to the stability of the Employee's Pension Insurance and National Pension programs.</p>

<p>The GPIF invests in a mix of domestic and international stocks and bonds, as well as FILP bonds. A large amount of the GPIF's assets are invested with external money managers, who are selected and monitored by GPIF managers. Only a small portion of the assets in the domestic bond category are invested by in-house investment managers. The majority of the GPIF's assets are allocated to passive investment funds that seek to mirror the returns of a market index within each asset class.</p>
