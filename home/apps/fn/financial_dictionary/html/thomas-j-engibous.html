<h1>Thomas J. Engibous</h1>

<p>A former chairman, CEO and president at electronics company Texas Instruments, Inc. Engibous helped the company increase its market share and helped his group earn record profits. He also narrowed the company's focus to semiconductors by divesting several of its other divisions.</p>

<p>Born in 1953 in St. Louis and raised outside of Chicago, Engibous earned his master's degree from Purdue University in 1976. He joined Texas Instruments that same year as a design engineer and worked his way to the top within the company's semiconductor group as department manager, vice president, senior vice president and executive vice president.</p>

<p>Engibous became president and CEO in 1996, shortly after leader James R. Junkins passed away. He added chairman to his job description in 1998. In 2004, he stepped down as president and CEO. Business Week named him to its list of Top 25 Managers in 2000 and Purdue awarded him an honorary Ph.D. in 1997.</p>
