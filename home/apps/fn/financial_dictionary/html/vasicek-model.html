<h1>Vasicek Interest Rate Model</h1>

<p>A method of modeling interest rate movement that describes the movement of an interest rate as a factor of market risk, time and equilibrium value that the rate tends to revert towards. This stochastic model is often used in the valuation of interest rate futures.</p>

<p>The Vasicek interest rate model values the instantaneous interest rate using the following equation:</p>

<p>dr<sub>t </sub>= a(b-r<sub>t</sub>)dt +sdW<sub>t</sub></p>

<p>Where  <i>Wt</i> is the random market risk (represented by the Wiener process)
<i>t</i> represents time
<i>a(b-r<sub>t</sub>)</i> represents the expected change in the interest rate at <i>t</i> (drift factor)
<i>a</i> is the speed of reversion
<i>b</i> is the long-term level of the mean
<i>s</i> is the volatility at the time</p>

<p>The Vasicek interest rate model states that the movement of interest rates is affected only by random market movements. In the absence of market shocks (i.e., when  dW<SUB>t </SUB>= 0) the interest rate remains constant (r<SUB>t</SUB> = b). When r<SUB>t</SUB> < b, the drift factor becomes positive, indicating that the interest rate will increase towards equilibrium.</p>
