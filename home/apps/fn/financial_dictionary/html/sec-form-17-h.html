<h1>SEC Form 17-H</h1>

<p>A report that is filed by a securities broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing its business activities related to risk assessment. Required reporting includes a copy of the current organizational chart, copies of all risk management and related policies, information related to any legal proceedings and financial statements.</p>

<p>Reporting and filing requirements of SEC form 17-H are covered under section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC tracks the filing status of all firms, but only reviews the 17-H form filings of six major dealers in detail under the program, because they have the highest number of customer accounts and therefore have been deemed "material firms."</p>
