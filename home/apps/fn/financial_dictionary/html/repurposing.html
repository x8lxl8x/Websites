<h1>Repurposing</h1>

<p>The use of something for a purpose other than its original intended used. Repurposing an item can be done by modifying it to fit a new use, or by using the item as is in a new way. The practice is not limited to physical items, and is a common practice for marketing material and content.</p>

<p>For example, a business may use images from an older, successful advertising campaign in a new campaign rather than come up with brand new images. In the pharmaceutical industry, medications are frequently used to treat illnesses and symptoms for which they weren't originally tested.</p>

<p>Repurposing is essentially a form of recycling. Instead of throwing an item away, an individual or business finds a new use for it. This can be a cost-effective strategy, since items that can be used instead of discarded prevent a business from having to purchase new, possibly expensive items.</p>
