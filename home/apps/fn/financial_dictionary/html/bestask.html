<h1>Best Ask</h1>

<p>The lowest quoted offer price among all those offered by competing market makers for a particular trading instrument. The ask price is effectively the lowest price that a seller is willing to offer for an asset, and the best ask is the most favorable ask price offered at a given time for a particular security. Ask is also known as the offer price.</p>

<p>The National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) are the bid and ask prices that traders and investors typically see. Active traders, short-term traders and day traders often study Level 2 quotes that include all the current bids and asks for a particular trading instrument. The NBBO is continually updated throughout the trading session, so that customers have access to these prices.</p>
