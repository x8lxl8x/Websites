<h1>Intellectual Capital</h1>

<p>The value of a company or organization's employee knowledge, business training and any proprietary information that may provide the company with a competitive advantage. Intellectual capital is considered an asset, and can broadly be defined as the collection of all informational resources a company has at its disposal that can be used to drive profits, gain new customers, create new products, or otherwise improve the business.</p>

<p>Some of the subsets of intellectual capital include human capital, information capital, brand awareness and instructional capital.</p>

<p>Intellectual capital is a real business asset, although measuring it is a very subjective task. Companies spend millions annually training their employees in business-specific topics and otherwise paying for increased competence in their staff. This capital employed provides a return to the company, one that can contribute toward many years' worth of business value.</p>

<p>As technology and process improvements become more of a differentiating factor within modern companies, intellectual capital is likely to become an even stronger force in the marketplace.</p>
