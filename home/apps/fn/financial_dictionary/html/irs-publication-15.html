<h1>IRS Publication 15 - Employer's Tax Guide</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service detailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information. The document covers withholding, depositing, reporting, paying and correcting of taxes for employees, not for the corporation itself. IRS Publication 15 provides the most up-to-date tax withholding tables for the current year.</p>

<p>IRS Publication 15 is used to determine federal income tax, not state or local taxes. Employers should refer to their state's tax rules to ensure that proper state income tax amounts are withheld from employees' paychecks. Extra tax information is also available in IRS Publication 15-A.</p>
