<h1>New Paradigm</h1>

<p>In the investing world, a new paradigm is a totally new way of doing things that has a huge effect on business. New paradigm draws its roots from the idea of a paradigm shift in science, in which technology or new findings completely change the way people think about or interact with something. In business the idea is the same; a whole new way of looking at things.</p>

<p>New paradigm became a widely used phrase in the 1990s, as marketing firms and businesses began to use the term for almost any new product or campaign. It was notably overused during the dotcom boom years. Anything and everything involved with the Internet was described as a "new paradigm" or a "paradigm shift."</p>
