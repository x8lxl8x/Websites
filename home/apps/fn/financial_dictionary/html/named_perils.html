<h1>Named Perils Insurance Policy</h1>

<p>A home insurance policy that only provides coverage on losses incurred to your property from hazards or events named on the policy. Named peril policies may be purchased as a less expensive alternative to a comprehensive coverage or broad policies, which are policies that tend to offer coverage to most perils.</p>

<p>Suppose a homeowner doesn't live in an earthquake and flooding prone area, but is still concerned about fire, theft and hail damage. The homeowner may elect to get a named perils policy and only declare coverage against fire, theft and hail, while leaving the earthquake and flooding coverage off the policy.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a broad coverage policy does not necessarily guarantee your property will be covered against all forms of perils. These policies contain conditions that cover what the insurer thinks are the most likely perils. Therefore it's a good idea for homeowners to check their broad coverage policies to make sure they do cover all the perils that they are concerned about. If the broad policy isn't sufficient, homeowners should buy a named peril policy to fill that hole in their coverage.</p>
