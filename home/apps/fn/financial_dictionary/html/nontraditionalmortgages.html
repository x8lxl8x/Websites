<h1>Nontraditional Mortgages</h1>

<p>A broad term describing mortgages that do not take the traditional form. A traditional mortgage would require a relatively high initial down payment of about 25% and 25-year payment schedule with an interest rate that is compounded on a monthly basis. Nontraditional mortgages include interest-only mortgages, payment option adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and subprime mortgages.</p>

<p>A subprime mortgage is extended to individuals who are of higher risk due to a history of bankruptcy, a higher debt to equity ratio, a history of non-payment of debt despite sufficient cash flow and/or a low credit score.</p>

<p>Interest-only mortgages are balloon loans in which the borrower must service the interest during the life of the loan and then make a balloon payment at maturity to pay off the principal.</p>

<p>ARMs are loans that have interest rates that will be reset in periodic intervals. These intervals can vary from months to years, and will cause payments to fluctuate more than a traditional mortgage.</p>
