<h1>Non-Client Order</h1>

<p>An order on an exchange made by a participant firm or on behalf of a partner, officer, director or employee of the participant firm. Where a participant firm is a firm that is entitled to trade on the exchange, it also known as a member firm. While these orders are allowed, priority must be given to client orders for the same securities.
Order tickets will be marked "N-C", "N", or "Emp" depending on the exchange indicating that the orders are non-client orders.</p>

<p>Also known as a "professional order".          </p>
