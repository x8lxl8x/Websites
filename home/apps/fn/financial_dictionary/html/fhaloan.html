<h1>FHA Loan</h1>

<p>A mortgage issued by federally qualified lenders and insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA loans are designed for low to moderate income borrowers who are unable to make a large down payment. FHA loans allow the borrower to borrow up to 97% of the value of the home. The 3% down payment requirement can come from a gift or a grant, which makes FHA loans popular with first-time buyers.</p>

<p>In addition to traditional first mortgages, the Federal Housing Administration offers a reverse mortgage program known as a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), which helps seniors convert the equity in their homes to cash while retaining the titles to their homes.</p>
