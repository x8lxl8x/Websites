<h1>Commoditize</h1>

<p>The act of making a process, good or service easy to obtain by making it as uniform, plentiful and affordable as possible. Something becomes commoditized when one offering is nearly indistinguishable from another. As a result of technological innovation, broad-based education and frequent iteration, goods and services become commoditized and, therefore, widely accessible.</p>

<p>In the past few decades, previously "modern" things such as microchips, personal computers - even the internet itself - have become essentially commoditized.  Combinations of commoditized products such as computers and business software have in effect commoditized many processes, such as business accounting and supply chain management.  In a truly capitalist society, the ability to commoditize anything is seen as a benefit to all, and opens up resources that can be put to better use on innovative enterprises.</p>
