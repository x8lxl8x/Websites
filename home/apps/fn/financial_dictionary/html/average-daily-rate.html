<h1>Average Daily Rate - ADR</h1>

<p>A metric widely used in the hospitality industry to indicate the average realized room rental per day. Average daily rate is one of the core indicators - along with other metrics such as occupancy rate and revenue per available room - used to measure the operating performance of a lodging unit such as a hotel or motel. Generally abbreviated as ADR.</p>

<p>For example, if a hotel has average daily revenue over a calendar quarter of $50,000 and has 500 rooms available per day, the ADR would be $100. This ADR would be used to compute the trend over time, particularly in relation to the ADR in the previous calendar quarter and the ADR in the year-ago quarter. It would also be used as a basis for comparing operating performance against other hotels that have similar characteristics such as size, clientele and location.</p>
