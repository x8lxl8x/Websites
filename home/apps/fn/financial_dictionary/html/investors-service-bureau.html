<h1>Investors Service Bureau</h1>

<p>A public service run by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that handles investor inquiries about listed investments. The Investors Service Bureau was established to help smaller investors become market participants, find brokers willing to work with them, and to answer questions that they may have about securities investments.</p>

<p>The Investors Service Bureau helps bring in small time investors into the securities market. While many brokers prefer established investors or institutional clients, opening up the market to more participants can increase demand for securities and make them more liquid assets.</p>
