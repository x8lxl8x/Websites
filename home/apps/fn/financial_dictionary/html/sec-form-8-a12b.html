<h1>SEC Form 8-A12B</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is required when a corporation wishes to issue certain classes of securities, including rights to buy such securities at a future date. This filing is also known as the Registration for Listing of a Security on a National Exchange Form. Included in SEC Form 8-A12B are details of the issuer and the security.</p>

<p>SEC Form 8-A12B can be extremely useful to investors who are considering the purchase of preferred stock rights and other types of hybrid fixed-income securities. Since many of these securities are not regularly followed in the financial media, the best source for definitive information is often on the initial SEC registration statement.</p>
