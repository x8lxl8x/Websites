<h1>Organic Sales</h1>

<p>The term "organic sales" refers to revenue generated from within a company. Organic sales encompasses those streams of revenue that are a direct result of the firm's existing operations. To generate external sales, the company would look for potential acquisition targets which would help increase top line growth.</p>

<p>Organic sales are the product of internal processes of a firm and are generated solely within the firm. Revenue streams resulting from mergers, takeovers, acquisitions and borrowing do not count towards organic sales since they are tied to activity outside the firm's internal finances.</p>
