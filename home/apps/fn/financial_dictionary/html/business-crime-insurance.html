<h1>Business Crime Insurance</h1>

<p>An insurance policy that companies purchase to ensure protection from losses resulting from business-related crime.  Protection can cover merchandise, money or other property loss when a company is victimized by someone perpetrating embezzlement, forgery, robbery, securities theft or another form of business-related crime.</p>

<p>Business owners should keep in mind that most commercial property policies do not cover crime-related losses.  Companies can invest in business crime insurance either as part of a larger insurance package (typically known as special multiperil insurance or a commercial package policy), or they can purchase separate, standalone policies to address and provide coverage for specific types of crime.</p>
