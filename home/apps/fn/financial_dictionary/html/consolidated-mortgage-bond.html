<h1>Consolidated Mortgage Bond</h1>

<p>A bond that consolidates the issues of multiple properties. If the properties covered by the consolidated mortgage bond are already mortgaged, the bond acts as a new mortgage. If the properties do not have outstanding mortgages then the bond is considered the first lien. It can be used as a way to refinance the mortgages on the individual properties. The bond is backed by real estate or physical capital.</p>

<p>Consolidated mortgage bonds are used by large companies with many properties, such as railroads, looking to refinance them into one bond to market to investors. It allows companies to set a single coupon rate instead of dealing with several, and makes investors happy because they can purchase a singular bond that covers physical assets of a similar type.</p>
