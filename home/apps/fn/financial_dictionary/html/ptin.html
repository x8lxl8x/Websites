<h1>Preparer Tax Identification Number - PTIN </h1>

<p>An Internal Revenue Service requirement implemented in 2011 that requires all paid federal tax return preparers to register with the federal government, and pay a fee to obtain a unique numerical identifier. Preparer tax identification number (PTIN) applicants must provide satisfactory answers to a number of suitability questions, to receive a PTIN. Tax preparers must renew their PTINs each calendar year, and the renewal fee is similar to the registration fee.</p>

<p>In addition to obtaining a PTIN, the IRS requires enrolled agents and registered tax return preparers to pass a test and complete continuing education requirements. These additional requirements do not apply to attorneys and certified public accountants in good standing, or to supervised preparers and non-1040 preparers, whose work is overseen by an enrolled agent, attorney or CPA.</p>
