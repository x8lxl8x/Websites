<h1>Taxpayer</h1>

<p>An individual or entity that is obligated to make payments to  municipal or government taxation agencies. The term taxpayer generally describes one who pays taxes. Taxes can exist in the form of income taxes as required by Federal and state governments and property taxes imposed on owners of real property (such as homes and vehicles) by municipal governments, along with many other forms.</p>

<p>Nearly all adults in the United States are subject to some form of taxation and, therefore, most adults are taxpayers. The term taxpayer often refers to the workforce of a country who pays for government projects through taxation. Nearly all government-funded projects are funded by the taxpayers, which can cause some controversy depending on the project.</p>
