<h1>Form 1310: Statement Of Person Claiming Refund Due A Deceased Taxpayer</h1>

<p>A tax form distributed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and used by taxpayers looking to claim a refund on behalf of a deceased person. Form 1310 should be used unless the filer is a surviving spouse submitting a joint return, or if the filer is a personal representative filing an original Form 1040 for the deceased  - in which case a court certificate must be attached indicating the appointment of the personal representative.</p>

<p>Form 1310 is used to match the taxpayer claiming the refund with the deceased. It also provides information on whether a will was left. States have different rules regarding the pay out of the refund. By submitting the form, the taxpayer agrees to abide by the applicable state law.</p>
