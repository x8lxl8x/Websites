<h1>Road Show</h1>

<p>A presentation by an issuer of securities to potential buyers. Road shows refer to when the management of a company that is issuing securities or doing an initial public offering (IPO) travels around the country to give presentations to analysts, fund managers and potential investors. The road show is intended to generate excitement and interest in the issue or IPO, and is often critical to the success of the offering. A non-deal road show occurs where executives hold discussions with current and potential investors, but nothing is offered for sale.</p>

<p>A road show is also known as a "dog and pony show."</p>

<p>Road show events may attract hundreds of prospective buyers interested in learning more about the offering. The events may include multimedia presentations and question-and-answer sessions with several of the company's officers present. Many of today's companies take advantage of the Internet and post versions of road show presentations online. In addition to the larger road show events, companies may also holder smaller, private meetings in the months and weeks preceding the offering.</p>
