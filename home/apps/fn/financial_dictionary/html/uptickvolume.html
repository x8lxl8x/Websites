<h1>Uptick Volume</h1>

<p>The volume of shares of a security that are traded when the price is increasing. Uptick volume is used in trading strategies based on trends, with the difference between uptick volume and downtick volume referred to as the money flow. Stocks with positive momentum will trade at an increasing uptick volume as current trading prices are above the average price.</p>

<p>Uptick volume can be used in momentum trading or to be analyzed as resistance bands. In a scenario in which ticks are increasing, investors may look at a security as having more buyer demand than the number of shares being sold. This is a bullish strategy that depends on the continuous rise in prices.</p>
