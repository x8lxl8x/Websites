<h1>Broker-Reseller</h1>

<p>A type of broker that acts as an intermediary between large brokerages and their clients. Broker-resellers typically take stock orders from clients and then use major brokerages to execute the trades.
While all major brokerages belong to reputable governing organizations, such as the National Association of Securities Dealers and similar bodies, not all broker-resellers have taken all the examinations and various other steps to be considered qualified as standard brokers. Therefore, an investor should be sure to perform the necessary due diligence on a reseller before any money changes hands.               </p>
