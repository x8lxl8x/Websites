<h1>Mirror Trading</h1>

<p>A forex strategy developed in the late 2000s that allows investors to copy the forex trading behavior of experienced and successful forex investors from around the world. Mirror trading was initially only available to institutional clients but was later made available to retail investors. Its automated nature can help prevent investors from making emotion-based trading decisions.</p>

<p>Mirror traders use a forex brokerage's trading platform to examine the histories and details of various trading strategies. The trader then chooses a trading strategy from the available options based on his or her investment goals, risk tolerance, investment capital and desired currencies. When strategy developers execute their trades, these trades are duplicated in mirror traders' accounts using automated software that operates 24/7.</p>
