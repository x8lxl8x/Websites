<h1>Attest Function</h1>

<p>The process of independent review of the validity of data audited by an accountant. The attest function encompasses all research done in an audit, including all of the testing and examination of a company's data and numbers. It also includes the finished audit report. An attest function often refers to the independent review (audit) of a company's financial statements.</p>

<p>The attest function is one of the most important duties of any Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In order for an attest function to be affective, an adequate amount of data must be sampled. The goal of an attest function is to express an opinion on a company's financial statements and provide some assurance as to their accuracy.</p>
