<h1>Trade Reporting And Compliance Engine - TRACE</h1>

<p>A program developed by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) which allows for the reporting of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions pertaining to eligible fixed-income securities. Brokers, who are NASD members and deal with specific fixed-income securities, are required to report their transactions by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.</p>

<p>From 1998-2001, the SEC approved rules adopted by the NASD regarding the transactions in all U.S. corporate bonds and secondary OTC fixed-income transactions. These rules were developed to bring greater price transparency to bond markets. Subsequently, TRACE was brought into play in 2002 to comply with the newly approved rules. The program replaced the previous Fixed Income Pricing System (FIPS) used since 1994.</p>
