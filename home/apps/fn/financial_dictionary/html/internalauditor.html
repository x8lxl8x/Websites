<h1>Internal Auditor</h1>

<p>An employee of a company charged with providing independent and objective evaluations of the company's financial and operational business activities, including its corporate governance.  Internal auditors also provide evaluations of operational efficiencies and will usually report to the highest levels of management on how to improve the overall structure and practices of the company.</p>

<p>Most publicly-traded companies have internal auditing teams to ensure not only compliance to internal structures, but also outside regulatory agencies such as the SEC and auditing guidelines as laid out by the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p>
