<h1>Cash On Delivery - COD</h1>

<p>A type of transaction in which payment for a good is made at the time of delivery. If the purchaser does not make payment when the good is delivered, then the good will be returned to the seller.</p>

<p>Payment can be made by cash, certified check or money order, depending on what is stipulated in the shipping contract.</p>

<p>This type of transaction is usually done through a shipping company and allows both the seller and the buyer of the product to minimize the risk of fraud or default. COD allows the purchaser to pay at the time of delivery instead of having to pay upfront. Payment is made to the shipping company, and the shipping company then relays the payment back to the seller.</p>
