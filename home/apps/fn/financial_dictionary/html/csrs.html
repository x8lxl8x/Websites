<h1>Civil Service Retirement System - CSRS</h1>

<p>A system that provided the retirement, disability and survivor benefits for most U.S. civilian service employees working for the federal government. It was replaced in 1987 by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), but employees who were originally set up through the CSRS still receive their benefits through that program, unless they were hired after 1983.</p>

<p>CSRS was created in 1920, and at that time possessed most of the  features of traditional pension plans. Today, FERS also incorporates social security benefits, government contributions and employee contributions.</p>
