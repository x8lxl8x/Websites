<h1>Open Ended Investment Company - OEIC</h1>

<p>A type of company or fund in the UK that is structured to invest in other companies with the ability to adjust constantly its investment criteria and fund size. The company's shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and the price of the shares are based largely on the underlying assets of the fund. There are no bid and ask quotes on the OEIC shares; buyers and sellers receive the same price.
These are open ended, which means that they can adjust the amount of shares in the fund by either issuing or eliminating shares. When shares are issued, the fund receives money and invests it. When eliminating shares, the fund pays out money from the fund. These funds can mix different types of investment strategies such as income and growth, and small cap and large cap.          </p>
