<h1>10-Year Treasury Note</h1>

<p>A debt obligation issued by the United States government that matures in 10 years. A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate once every six months and pays the face value to the holder at maturity. An advantage of investing in 10-year Treasury notes, and other federal government securities, is that the interest payments are exempt from state and local income tax. However, they are still taxable at the federal level.</p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury also sells notes with two, three, five and seven-year terms. All of these notes, along with Treasury bills and bonds, can be purchased directly from the U.S. government through the TreasuryDirect website via competitive or noncompetitive bidding with a minimum purchase of $100 and in $100 increments. They can also be purchased indirectly through a bank or broker. Investors can choose to hold Treasury notes until maturity or sell early. There is no minimum ownership term.</p>
