<h1>Extraordinary General Meeting - EGM</h1>

<p>A meeting other than the annual general meeting between a company's shareholders, executives and any other members. An EGM is usually called on short notice and deals with an urgent matter.</p>

<p>In most cases the only time shareholders and executives meet is during the annual general meeting, which is usually at a set time. However, certain events may require shareholders to come together to solve a certain problem, such as the removal of an executive.          </p>
