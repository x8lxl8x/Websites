<h1>Mogul</h1>

<p>An individual who has been very successful in business and has become very wealthy as a result. Mark Zuckerberg became a mogul when his social-media creation, Facebook, became tremendously popular; Jack Welch is considered a mogul for his success as former chairman and CEO of General Electric; Mogul Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry with his assembly-line production method and the Model-T car.</p>

<p>Many business moguls are household names, but this kind of fame isn't necessary to be considered a mogul. Such individuals possess innovative ideas, a willingness to take risks and the keen business sense that it takes to make their ideas possible and their risks profitable. Moguls might also be called magnates, tycoons or captains of industry.</p>
