<h1>Fund-Drainer</h1>

<p>An unsuccessful fundraising event which actually loses money for the sponsoring organization. Since fundraising events often entail considerable work, a fund-drainer can be extremely demoralizing for the organizers. Fundraising events should be carefully planned and managed in or to ensure they raise sufficient funds to be worthwhile endeavors.</p>

<p>A fundraiser should be treated with the same seriousness as any business venture. Often not all of the assets required for larger fundraising events can be acquired for free. For example, securing the venue and equipment, and providing catering may all be substantial expenses paid by the fundraising organization. If in the end, the event does not garner sufficient donations then the fundraiser may lose significant funds for the organization.</p>
