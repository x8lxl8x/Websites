<h1>Associate Bank</h1>

<p>A bank that is affiliated, usually through membership, in a regional or national organization, such as a clearing house, an electronic payments network or a bank card network, such as Visa or MasterCard. There are usually different classes of membership in regional and national associations, which correlate with shares owned or fees paid.</p>

<p>The term "associate bank" is also used to describe banks that accommodate each other's customers across geographic or national lines when each bank's geographic reach is limited. For example, a small state bank in the United States may have an associate relationship with a bank in London, in order to accommodate a customer traveling there.</p>
