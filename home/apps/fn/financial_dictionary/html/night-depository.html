<h1>Night Depository</h1>

<p>A bank drop box where merchants can deposit their daily cash, checks and credit card slips outside of banking hours. The bank collects the deposits and credits them to the merchant's account on the following business day.</p>

<p>Night depositories provide additional security for merchants, since they don't have to keep this money at their business location overnight, where it could be vulnerable to theft.</p>

<p>Instead of the envelopes that individual customers use to make bank deposits at ATMs, merchants often use lockable zippered bags, which are more secure and hold a larger volume of paper.</p>
