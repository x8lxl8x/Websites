<h1>SEC Form U-57</h1>

<p>A notification to the Securities and Exchange Commission of status as a foreign utility company. The SEC Form U-57 contains the name and address of the company and a basic description of the facilities, as well as the names and interests of any party that holds more than 5% of any class of voting securities in the company. The name of any domestic company associated with the foreign entity must be listed as well.</p>
