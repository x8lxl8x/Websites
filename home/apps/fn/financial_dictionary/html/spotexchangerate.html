<h1>Spot Exchange Rate</h1>

<p>The rate of a foreign-exchange contract for immediate delivery. Also known as "benchmark rates", "straightforward rates" or "outright rates", spot rates represent the price that a buyer expects to pay for a foreign currency in another currency.</p>

<p>Though the spot exchange rate is said to be settled immediately, the globally accepted settlement cycle for foreign-exchange contracts is two days. Foreign-exchange contracts are therefore settled on the second day after the day the deal is made.</p>
