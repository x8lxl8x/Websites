<h1>Waiver Of Premium Rider</h1>

<p>A clause in an insurance policy that waives the policyholder's obligation to pay any further premiums should he or she become seriously ill or disabled. A waiver of premium allows people to benefit from an insurance policy, even when they cannot work.</p>

<p>For an upfront charge, most insurance companies will incorporate a waiver of premium into a policy. The waiver is usually associated with life insurance policies, and requires the policyholder to be disabled for a specified amount of time, such as being incapacitated for six months. To have a waiver of premium, some companies may also place other requirements on the policyholder, such as being healthy and below a certain age.</p>
