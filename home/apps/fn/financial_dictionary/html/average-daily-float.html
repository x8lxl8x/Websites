<h1>Average Daily Float</h1>

<p>1. The dollar amount of checks or other negotiable instruments that are in the process of collection over a certain period, divided by the number of days in the period; or</p>

<p>2. The number of company shares that are actually outstanding and available for trading on the public market on an average daily basis.</p>

<p>The banking term for float is most commonly applied to banks, although it can also refer to large corporations who have both checks deposited and paid checks outstanding.</p>

<p>As a trading term, the average daily float is a measure of the liquid market for a company's stock. If a company is closely held and only a small portion of the stock is trading in the public markets, it will affect the bid/ask spread and a number of other aspects of how the stock is valued.</p>
