<h1>Guaranteed Loan</h1>

<p>A loan guaranteed by a third party in the event that the borrower defaults. The loan is quite often guaranteed by a government agency which will purchase the debt from the lending financial institution and take on responsibility for the loan.</p>

<p>This type of agreement is often made if the borrower is an unattractive candidate for a loan. It is a way for people in dire need of financial assistance to acquire funds, without putting excessive risk on the lending financial institution.</p>
