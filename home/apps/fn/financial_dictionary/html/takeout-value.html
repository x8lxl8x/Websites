<h1>Takeout Value</h1>

<p>The estimated value of a company if it were to be taken private or acquired. A firm's takeout value considers various metrics, such as cash flows, assets, earnings and multiples used in similar takeovers. The current mergers and acquisitions environment can also affect the takeout value of a company.</p>

<p>There is not an exact formula for takeout valuation, since a variety of metrics, such as EBIDTA multiple, P/E ratio and even firm-specific information can be taken into account.</p>

<p>The takeout value is used by both financial analysts and shareholders. The analysts will use the valuation to determine a range of possible price levels for takeover bids, while shareholders can estimate how much return they might receive if their shares are acquired.</p>

<p>Takeout valuation uses the metrics of the target company and compares them to multiples used in similar takeover transactions. For example, a past takeover saw a firm with earnings of $5 million get acquired for $22.5 million. This implies an earnings multiple of 4.5 ($22.5 million / $5 million). A similar company with earnings of $3 million is now being considered a takeover target. The takeout value of the new company would be $13.5 million ($3 million Ã— 4.5).</p>
