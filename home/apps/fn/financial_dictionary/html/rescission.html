<h1>Rescission</h1>

<p>The right of an individual involved in a contract to return to a state identical to that before they entered into the agreement, due to courts not recognizing the contract as legally binding. In many cases, rescission may be an option if there is a material error in the contract, among other reasons.</p>

<p>This is an important concept in the business world, as contracts are commonplace. Should a contract not be legally binding, most often courts will try to return the non-liable parties affected to the state they were in before the contract was entered into.</p>
