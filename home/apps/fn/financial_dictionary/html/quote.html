<h1>Quote</h1>

<p>1. The last price at which a security or commodity traded, meaning the most recent price on which a buyer and seller agreed and at which some amount of the asset was transacted.</p>

<p>2. The bid or ask quotes are the most current prices and quantities at which the shares can be bought or sold. The bid quote shows the price and quantity at which a current buyer is willing to purchase the shares, while the ask shows what a current participant is willing to sell the shares for.</p>

<p>This is also known as an asset's "quoted price".</p>

<p>1. Quotes for stock and bond prices change throughout the trading day as new transactions occur one after another in a continual stream of trades. When you look up a stock quote for a given company, you are looking at the most recent price at which a trade was successfully executed for that particular security.</p>

<p>2. Potential investors or sellers in a company are more concerned about the bid and ask quotes as they reflect at what prices the stock can be bought or sold, while the price quote as defined in the first definition shows the price at which the stock traded most recently.</p>
