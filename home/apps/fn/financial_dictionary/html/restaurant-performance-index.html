<h1>Restaurant Performance Index - RPI</h1>

<p>A monthly index tracking the performance of the restaurant industry. The Restaurant Performance Index (RPI) is calculated based on answers given in response to a survey sent out to restaurateurs nationwide each month. The survey gauges answers in key areas such as same-store sales, traffic, labor, CAPEX, and others.</p>

<p>The index is divided into two main components: a "current situation index" and an "expectations index". The current situation index data is based on current or recent indicators during the reference month, while the expectations index is based on forward-looking indicators such as how much capital the restaurant plans to use in the next six months. The RPI is published at the end of each month.</p>
