<h1>Group Universal Life Policy - GULP</h1>

<p>Universal life insurance that is offered to on a group basis, allowing for a less expensive policy than what is typically offered to an individual. A group universal life policy is most commonly purchased by businesses looking to provide life insurance coverage for their employees.</p>

<p>Buying a group universal life policy is similar to buying food in bulk. The cost to cover each individual is cheaper because the policy is designed to cover a large group, just as purchasing a large amount of a particular grocery item is cheaper on a per item basis than buying each item separately.</p>
