<h1>412(i) Plan</h1>

<p>A defined-benefit pension plan designed for small business owners in the United States. This is a tax-qualified benefit plan, so any amount that the owner contributes to the plan becomes available immediately as a tax deduction to the company. The plan must be funded solely by guaranteed annuities, or a combination of annuities and life insurance.</p>

<p>These plans have been developed for small business owners who find it difficult to invest in their company, while also trying to save for retirement. This plan is unique in that it provides fully guaranteed retirement benefits, it must be funded by an insurance company and it provides the largest tax-deduction possible.</p>

<p>Due to the large premiums that must be paid each year, this plan may not be ideal for all small business owners. This plan would tend to benefit small businesses that are established and quite profitable.</p>
