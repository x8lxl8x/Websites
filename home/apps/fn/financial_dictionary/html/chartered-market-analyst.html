<h1>Chartered Market Analyst - CMA</h1>

<p>A professional designation awarded by the American Academy of Financial Management (AAFM) to professionals who have at least seven years of experience in financial research and market analysis or a related industry. Chartered Market Analysts must first complete AAFM's educational requirements and pass an exam.

<p>The study program to become a CMA covers topics such as profitability analysis, valuation techniques, pricing options and fixed-income derivatives, using software to solve finance problems and more. Successful applicants earn the right to use the CMA designation with their names, which can improve job opportunities, professional reputation and pay.
