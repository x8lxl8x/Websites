<h1>Right Of First Refusal</h1>

<p>A contractual right of an entity to be given the opportunity to enter into a business transaction with a person or company before anyone else can. Since an entity with the right of first refusal has the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a transaction that generally involves an asset, it is akin to a having a call option on the asset. If the entity with the right of first refusal declines to enter into a transaction, the owner of the asset is free to open the bidding up to other interested parties.</p>

<p>A right of first refusal is usually negotiated by a party when it wants to see how a business will turn out. The party may therefore prefer to hold the option to get involved at a later point, rather than make the outlay and commitment upfront.</p>

<p>In the business world, rights of first refusal are commonly seen in joint venture situations. The partners in a joint venture generally possess the right of first refusal on buying out the stakes held by other partners, should the latter wish to leave the joint venture.</p>

<p>Rights of first refusal are a common feature in many other areas, from real estate to sports and entertainment. For example, a publishing house may ask for the right of first refusal on future books by a relatively new author.</p>
