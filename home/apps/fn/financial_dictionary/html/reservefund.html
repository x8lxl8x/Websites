<h1>Reserve Fund</h1>

<p>An account set aside by an individual or business to meet any unexpected costs that may arise in the future as well as the future costs of upkeep. In most cases, the fund is simply a savings account or another highly liquid asset, as it is impossible to predict when an unexpected cost may arise. However, if the fund is set up to meet the costs of scheduled upgrades, less liquid assets may be used.</p>

<p>An individual, for example, may put money into a reserve account to save money in case of unexpected unemployment. A business, such as one dealing with rental properties, will put some rental income into a fund used to pay for any unexpected repairs to the properties. Condominiums often will set up reserve funds in which condo owners pay a set monthly amount to maintain the quality of the condominium.</p>
