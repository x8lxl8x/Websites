<h1>Micro Risk</h1>

<p>A type of political risk that refers to political actions in a host country that can adversely affect selected foreign operations. Micro risk can come about from events that may or may not be in the reigning government's control.</p>

<p>For example, diplomatic tension with Country A has caused the citizens of Country B  to vandalize all Country A based companies situated in Country B. In this example, only operations from Country A were faced with adverse situations. Operations from other countries were not affected.           </p>
