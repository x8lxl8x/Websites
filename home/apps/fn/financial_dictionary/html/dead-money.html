<h1>Dead Money</h1>

<p>A slang term for money invested in a security with minor hopes of appreciation or earning a return. The stock may also be referred as dead money by analysts, as a warning to investors who might purchase the shares.</p>

<p>Funds that are not earning interest or income are known as dead money. Some investors will hold a stock despite recent price drops, hoping that it will turn around and earn back some of the lost value. However, if the investment is dead money, the likelihood of a turnaround is low, and investors should consider selling the shares before incurring additional losses.</p>
