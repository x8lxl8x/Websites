<h1>China Concepts Stock</h1>

<p>The stock of a company whose assets or earnings have significant activities in China. China concepts stocks will trade on different stock exchanges such as the Hong Kong exchange, under the name of H-Shares or "red chip" stocks.  The People's Republic of China is undergoing major financial transformation, so many leading mainland-based companies chose to list themselves elsewhere to gain access to investor capital as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The China concepts stocks are considered one of the purest investment plays on China's long-term economic growth outside of direct mainland investment.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1980, the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) started opening up to joint ventures with foreign companies. China is developing capital markets of its own to attract foreign funds; they have even taken part in the some of the biggest initial public offerings in history as they transition large state-run businesses into publicly-traded companies.</p>
