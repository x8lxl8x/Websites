<h1>Finite-Life REIT - FREIT</h1>

<p>A real estate investment trust (REIT) that aims to sell its real estate holdings within a specified time frame so as to realize capital gains on its properties. Because of the definite date of their liquidation, finite-life REITs may be more liquid and trade closer to their net asset values than conventional REITs.</p>

<p>Finite-life REITs were introduced in the U.S. in the 1980s as an extension of REITS. FREITs are criticized for their inability to exploit a proper buy and hold strategy in terms of their underlying assets, which can result in poor performance compared to their generic counterparts.</p>
