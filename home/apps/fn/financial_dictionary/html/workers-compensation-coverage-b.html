<h1>Workers' Compensation Coverage B</h1>

<p>An insurance policy that covers medical care, lost income and rehabilitation costs for employees who are injured on the job. Workers Compensation Coverage B provides coverage to employees when the employer is liable.
This type of workers' compensation is also called Employers' Liability Coverage. It covers:</p>

<p>Bodily Injury By Accident - $100,000 each accident
Bodily Injury By Disease - $500,000 policy limit
Bodily Injury By Disease - $100,000 for each employee</p>

<p>The coverage consists of parts A and B. Employers are required by law under the Workers' Compensation Act to provide coverage for their employees.</p>

<p>Under this type of coverage, workers who are injured on the job can be provided with 100% coverage of all medical expenses, 66.66% of lost wages, a lump sum for disability, and a disfigurement and death benefit. This coverage is required in most states if a company has three or more employees including the owners or uninsured subcontractors including their employees during one year.</p>
