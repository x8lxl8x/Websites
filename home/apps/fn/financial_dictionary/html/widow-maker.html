<h1>Widow Maker</h1>

<p>In everyday usage, a widow maker is the name of an artery with blockage that often causes death by severe heart attack, but in finance, a widow maker is an extremely risky investment that subjects the investor to very large potential losses. Futures in heating oil and gasoline are an example of a type of investment that can be subject to the moniker "widow maker."</p>

<p>The wise investor will look at a highly speculative investment as a gambling venture and mitigate risk accordingly. Risk mitigation strategies might include investing only a small percentage of total assets in the speculative "investment" or implementing trading strategies that limit losses.</p>
