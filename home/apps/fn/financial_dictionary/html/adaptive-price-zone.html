<h1>Adaptive Price Zone - APZ</h1>

<p>A technical indicator that helps investors identify possible market turning points. The adaptive price zone (APZ) can be especially useful in a sideways-moving market. This indicator attempts to signal significant price movements by using a a set of bands based on short-term, double-smoothed exponential moving averages. It can help day traders profit in volatile markets by signaling price reversal points, which can indicate potentially lucrative times to buy or sell. The APZ can be implemented as part of an automated trading system.</p>

<p>Technical analysis is one of two major methods for making stock-trading decisions. Whereas fundamental analysis looks at the value of the company behind the stock, technical analysis ignores this completely and focuses solely on price movements. Technical traders use charts and other tools to analyze a stock's price and trade volume and predict how a stock will move.</p>
