<h1>Qualified Institutional Buyer - QIB</h1>

<p>A corporate entity that falls within the "accredited investor" category, defined in SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D. A Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB) is one that owns and invests, on a discretionary basis, at least $100 million in securities; for a broker-dealer the threshold is $10 million. QIBs encompass a wide range of entities, including banks, savings and loans associations, insurance companies, investment companies, employee benefit plans or entities owned entirely by accredited investors. Banks and S&L associations must also have a net worth of at least $25 million to satisfy the QIB criteria.</p>

<p>QIBs must be either domestic or foreign institutions. Individuals are not permitted to be QIBs, regardless of their level of wealth or financial sophistication.</p>

<p>QIBs are permitted to participate in the market for securities under Rule 144A, which is a safe harbor exemption from the SEC's registration requirements for securities. Transactions generally conducted under Rule 144A include: private placements of debt or preferred securities by public issuers, offerings by foreign issuers who wish to avoid U.S. reporting requirements, and common stock offerings by non-reporting issuers.</p>
