<h1>Fibonacci Clusters</h1>

<p>A tool used in technical analysis that combines various numbers of Fibonacci retracements, all of which are drawn from different highs and lows. Fibonacci clusters are indicators which are usually found on the side of a price chart and look like a series of horizontal bars with various degrees of shading. Each retracement level that overlaps with another makes the horizontal bar on the side darker at that price level. The most significant levels of support and resistance are found where the Fibonacci cluster is the darkest.
This is a useful tool to gauge the relative strength of the support or resistance of various price levels in one quick glance. Traders often pay close attention to the volume around the identified levels to confirm the strength of the support/resistance.</p>
