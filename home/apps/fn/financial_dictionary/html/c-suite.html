<h1>C-Suite</h1>

<p>A widely-used slang term used to collectively refer to a corporation's most important senior executives. C-Suite gets its name because top senior executives' titles tend to start with the letter <i>C</i>, for chief, as in chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief information officer.</p>

<p>Also called "C-level executives."</p>

<p>The C-suite is considered the most important and influential group of individuals at a company. Being a member of this group comes with high-stakes decision making, a more demanding workload and high compensation. As "chief" titles proliferate, however, job-title inflation may decrease the prestige associated with being a member of the C-suite.</p>
