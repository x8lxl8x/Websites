<h1>IRS Publication 594</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that outlines the steps that the agency may take in order to collect a taxpayer's outstanding balance. IRS Publication 594 is typically sent along with the final tax bill if the taxpayer is overdue or owes interest or a penalty. Actions undertaken by the IRS on an overdue account may include contacting the taxpayer by phone, assigning a revenue officer to resolve an outstanding balance or enforcing collection through liens, levies, seizures or liquidation.</p>

<p>Receiving a copy of IRS Publication 594 in the mail does not mean that a taxpayer cannot dispute the IRS' findings. Taxpayers should gather records and past tax returns and contact the IRS.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the possibility of overdue taxes, taxpayers should check the number of allowances selected on form W-4 or increase estimated tax payments.</p>
