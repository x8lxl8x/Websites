<h1>Automatic Reinvestment Plan</h1>

<p>An investment program in which capital gains or other income received from investments are automatically used for reinvestment purposes. In the case of a mutual fund, for example, capital gains produced by the fund would be used to automatically purchase more shares, instead of being distributed to the investor as cash.</p>

<p>By using an automatic reinvestment plan, an investor is able to easily make use of his or her investment gains to produce further gains, taking advantage of compounding. Over a period of years, the added value produced by automatic reinvestment can turn out to be worth a substantial sum.</p>
