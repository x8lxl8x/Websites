<h1>Yearly Probability Of Dying</h1>

<p>A numerical figure that depicts the likelihood of someone dying per year. The yearly probability of dying is determined by looking at a mortality table which shows the rate of death at each age in terms of the number of deaths per thousand. The data in the chart is determined by dividing the number of people dying during a given year by the number of people alive at the beginning of that same year.</p>

<p>The yearly probability of dying is often associated with calculations involving insurance probability estimates. In calculating these death probabilities, some associated terms include instantaneous death, force of mortality and quinquennial (recurring every five years) death probabilities.  </p>
