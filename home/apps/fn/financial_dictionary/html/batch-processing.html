<h1>Batch Processing</h1>

<p>Processing transactions in a group or batch. No user interaction is required once batch processing is underway. This differentiates batch processing from transaction processing, which involves processing transactions one at a time and requires user interaction. While batch processing can be carried out at any time, it is particularly suited to end-of-cycle processing, such as for processing a bank's reports at the end of a day, or generating monthly or bi-weekly payrolls.</p>

<p>For example, monthly bills for utilities and other services received by consumers are typically generated by batch processing. Batch processing has a number of benefits, such as enabling the sharing of computer resources and facilitating better use of these resources.</p>
