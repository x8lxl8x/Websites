<h1>Yale School of Management - Yale SOM</h1>

<p>Yale University's graduate business school. The school offers both MBA and Ph.D. level programs and is known for, among other things, its focus on finance and ethics. The school recently introduced a new kind of integrated curriculum that combines a brief period of foreign study with organizational and employee analysis.</p>

<p>Yale SOM was established in 1976 and is located in New Haven, Connecticut. It is one of the smaller business schools in America, with nearly 100 faculty and over 400 students in its MBA program. Admission is highly competitive; less than 15% of all applicants were admitted in 2010.</p>
