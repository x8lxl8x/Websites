<h1>Limited Trading Authorization</h1>

<p>A level of trading authorization that gives an agent or broker the power to place orders or make inquiries concerning a client's account. Limited trading authorization allows the agent to act on behalf of an investor, but does not allow for the dispersement of account funds.</p>

<p>A step down from full authorization, limited trading authorization allows a broker or agent to purchase and sell securities at his or her discretion. This is often used when a client does not know much about investing, and trusts the broker to properly manage his or her account. In circumstances where the client is a knowledgeable investor, limited authorization can allow the client to capitalize on broker recommendations.</p>
