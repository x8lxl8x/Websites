<h1>Callable Certificate Of Deposit</h1>

<p>An FDIC insured certificate of deposit (CD) that contains a call feature similar to other types of callable fixed-income securities. Callable CDs can be redeemed (called away) by the issuing bank prior to their stated maturity, usually within a given time frame, and at a preset call price.</p>

<p>A bank adds a call feature to a CD so it does not have to continue paying a higher rate to the CD holder if interest rates drop. Callable CDs are often redeemed at a premium to their purchase price as an incentive for investors to take the call risk.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank issues a traditional CD that pays 4.5% to the investor, and interest rates fall to a point where the bank could issue the same CD to someone else for only 3.5%, the bank would be paying 1% higher rate for the duration of the CD. By using a callable CD, the bank can pay a premium to stop paying the higher rate.</p>
