<h1>Revenue Per Occupied Room - RevPOR</h1>

<p>An industry metric used to evaluate companies in the hotel and lodging industries. RevPOR is used in conjunction with, or in place of, the more standard revenue per available room (RevPAR) statistic. RevPAR is calculated by taking the RevPOR value and multiplying it by the occupancy rate.</p>

<p>RevPOR may also be expressed as "total RevPOR", which includes not only the room rate itself, but also any extra services such as room service, laundry services and in-room movie viewing, among others.</p>

<p>For many hotel operators, the total revenue received per room can be much more than the per-day "boilerplate" rate, and is a more full expression of how much the company is receiving per customer. RevPOR is used by analysts to determine the total revenue and profit potential of a company; occupancy rates will rise and fall with the general and local economy, but RevPOR is a metric that stands independent of how full the hotel is at any point in time.</p>
