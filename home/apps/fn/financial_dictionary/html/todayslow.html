<h1>Today's Low</h1>

<p>A security's intraday low trading price. Today's low is the lowest price at which a stock trades over the course of a trading day. Today's low is typically lower than the opening or closing price.</p>

<p>When you look at a stock quote, you can find today's low by looking at the first number listed next to "Range." Today's low and today's high are important to day traders and technical analysts, who seek to earn profits from a security's short-term price movements and identify and track trends. One way that day traders use today's low along with today's high is to identify gaps, or sudden jumps up or down in a stock's price with no trading in between. Gaps are used in technical analysis to identify directional movement, average true range/price volatility, candlestick patterns and more. Traders then analyze these patterns to determine profitable entry and exit points.</p>
