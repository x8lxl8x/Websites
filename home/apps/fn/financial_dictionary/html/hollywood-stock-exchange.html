<h1>Hollywood Stock Exchange - HSX</h1>

<p>An online prediction market where "investors" bet on the performance of various components of the entertainment industry through Moviestocks, Starbonds, TVStocks, Movie Funds, Idol Warrants and derivatives. Trades are made in "Hollywood dollars," which players receive when they open an account, make successful trades and participate in the website's quizzes. Each "investment" has a ticker-like symbol: for example, the symbol for "Ironman 3" is IRNM3.</p>

<p>HSX has been around since 1996 and is owned by Cantor Fitzgerald, which launched a real-world exchange similar to HSX, called the Cantor Exchange, in 2010. Prediction markets, which tend to be quite accurate, exist for a wide range of subjects. Some, like the Iowa Electronic Markets, trade in real money.</p>
