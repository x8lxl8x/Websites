<h1>Attornment</h1>

<p>The act of granting authority or jurisdiction to a party even though no legal rights exist. Attornment most commonly relates to laws regulating real property and is designed to acknowledge the relationship between the parties in a transaction.</p>

<p>For example, attornment may occur when a tenant leases an apartment only to have the owner change during the course of the lease. The attornment agreement does not create a new set of rights for the owner unless it is signed by the tenant. If the tenant refuses to sign, the landlord may be able to use this as grounds for eviction.</p>
