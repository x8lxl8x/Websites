<h1>Zaraba method</h1>

<p>A method of matching orders that involves using an auction-like process to trade securities. The orders are organized by both their prices and the time that they were taken. As soon as an order for a security is delivered, it is compared and matched with orders already in the order book. When a bid comes in that matches the price requested by another order, the two orders are executed and taken out of the order book.</p>

<p>The zaraba method is most often associated with the Japanese stock exchanges. Typically, the zaraba method is used during normal trading sessions, whereas a different order matching method, which is called the itayose method, is used to determine the opening and closing prices for each morning and afternoon trading session.</p>
