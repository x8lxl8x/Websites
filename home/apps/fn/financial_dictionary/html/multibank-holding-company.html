<h1>Multibank Holding Company</h1>

<p>A company that owns and/or controls two or more banks. Bank holding companies are governed by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and its amendments. Because of their corporate status, they are subject to more regulations than banks, but also have more options for raising capital.</p>

<p>State banking laws influence whether multibank holding companies are likely to set up in a particular state. Unit banking states have more multibank holding companies, while branch and limited-branch banking states have more one-bank holding companies.</p>

<p>Examples of multibank holding companies include BOK Financial Corporation, Camco Financial Corporation, Old National Bancorp, Rurban Financial Corp. and QCR Holdings, Inc.</p>
