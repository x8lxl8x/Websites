<h1>Federal Home Loan Bank System - FHLB</h1>

<p>An organization created by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 to increase the amount of funds available for lending institutions who provide mortgages and similar loan agreements to individuals. This system was created in response to the depressive economic conditions of the era, which had impaired the U.S. banking system.</p>

<p>Also referred to as the "FHL Bank System".</p>

<p>Having served its original objectives well, the FHLB system now primarily focuses on increasing the amount of loanable funds available for affordable housing and community development projects. It continues to have a material impact on housing and development financing, offering funds to member institutions at rates that are usually lower than commercially competitive prices.</p>
