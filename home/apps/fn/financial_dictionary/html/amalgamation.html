<h1>Amalgamation</h1>

<p>The combination of one or more companies into a new entity. An amalgamation is distinct from a merger because neither of the combining companies survives as a legal entity. Rather, a completely new entity is formed to house the combined assets and liabilities of both companies.</p>

<p>This sense of the term amalgamation has generally fallen out of popular use and the terms "merger" or "consolidation" are often used instead. Although companies may be merged or acquired using a variety of different techniques, the net effect is substantially the same from a lay perspective.</p>
