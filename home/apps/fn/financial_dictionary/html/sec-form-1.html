<h1>SEC Form 1</h1>

<p>An application for and amendments to an application for registration as a national securities exchange or exemption from registration pursuant to section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 6 of the Exchange Act requires that stock exchanges register with the SEC Form 1 in order to be considered national securities exchanges.</p>

<p>Major stock exchanges such as Nasdaq and the NYSE have registered with the SEC and are considered to be national securities exchanges. However, if an "exchange" has a very limited number of transactions, they may file for an exemption from registration with the SEC under section 5 of the 1934 Exchange Act.</p>
