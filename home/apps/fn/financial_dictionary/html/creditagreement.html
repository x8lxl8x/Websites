<h1>Credit Agreement</h1>

<p>A legal contract in which a bank arranges to loan a customer a certain amount of money for a specified amount of time. The credit agreement outlines all the rules and regulations associated with the contract. This includes the interest that must be paid on the loan.</p>

<p>A credit agreement can be a lengthy and detailed document that explains all the terms of the contract. For the most part, all types of loans (ranging from credit cards to mortgages) have some sort of credit agreement, which must be signed and agreed upon by both the bank or lender and the customer - the contract does not come into effect until the document has been signed by both parties.</p>
