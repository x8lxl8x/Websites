<h1>Unconditional Vesting</h1>

<p>Pension benefits that are entitled to the employee without any restrictions. The employee is fully entitled to the vested benefits, even if he or she chooses to withdraw plan contributions.</p>

<p>This is opposite to conditional vesting, in which entitlement to vested benefits is contingent upon the plan participant's contributions being retained in the plan and not withdrawn.</p>

<p>Since a company uses pensions as a tool for long-term retention of employees, its entitlement to present or future pension benefits is contingent upon continued employment with the company for a specified period. Once this condition is satisfied, the pension benefits vest unconditionally with the employee.</p>
