<h1>Word-Of-Mouth Marketing - WOM Marketing </h1>

<p>When a consumer's interest for a company's product or service is reflected in their daily dialogs. Word-of-mouth marketing can be encouraged through different publicity activities set up by companies, or by having opportunities to encourage consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-marketer communications. It includes buzz, viral, blog, emotional and social media marketing.</p>

<p>Consumers are more emotionally bonded to a company when they feel they are listened to by the company. That is why many companies will have sale representatives discuss their products and services with consumers personally or through a feedback phone line. This kind of interaction, as well as promotional events can stimulate conversations about a company's product.</p>
