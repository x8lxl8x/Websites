<h1>Firm Commitment</h1>

<p>1. A lending institution's promise to enter into a loan agreement with a specific entity within a certain period of time.</p>

<p>2. An underwriter's agreement to assume all inventory risk and purchase all securities directly from the issuer for sale to the public at the price specified.</p>

<p>1. The lender specifies the terms that that must be met in order for the loan to be processed. Also known as a "standby loan commitment".</p>

<p>2. In a firm commitment, underwriters act dealers and are responsible for any unsold inventory. The dealer profits from the spread between the purchase price and the public offering price. Also known as a "firm commitment underwriting".</p>
