<h1>Savings Rate</h1>

<p>The amount of money, expressed as a percentage or ratio, that one deducts from his/her disposable personal income to set aside as a nest egg or for retirement. The cash accumulated is typically put into very low-risk investments (depending on various factors such as expected time until retirement), like a money market fund or a personal IRA comprised of non-aggressive mutual funds, stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>For years, the savings rate in the United States has declined. In the 1970s and 1980s, personal savings rates were in the 5% to 7% range but then decreased to 1% to 3% range in the 21st Century. These averages figure tend to fall even lower as the American population, as a whole, continues to age. The national average savings rate is often determined by how a particular culture views debt and values possessions.</p>
