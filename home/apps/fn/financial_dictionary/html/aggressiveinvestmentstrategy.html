<h1>Aggressive Investment Strategy</h1>

<p>A method of portfolio management and asset allocation that attempts to achieve maximum return. An aggressive investment strategy attempts to grow an investment at an above-average rate compared to its industry or the overall market, but usually take on additional risk.</p>

<p>Because their aim is capital growth, aggressive investors place a higher percentage of their assets in equities rather than in safer debt securities. As such, aggressive investors build portfolios that bear a fairly high amount of risk. But before assuming this strategy, an investor should evaluate his or risk tolerance - making sure it's high - and be sure that he or she has quite a few years before needing the invested funds.</p>
