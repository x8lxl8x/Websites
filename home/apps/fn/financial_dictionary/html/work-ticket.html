<h1>Work Ticket</h1>

<p>A form that shows the time spent by an employee working on a particular job. It is used as a basis for billing the costs of direct labor to customers, and may also be used for calculating wages of employees who are paid by the hour.</p>

<p>Also known as time card.</p>

<p>For example, a person who has given his car to an automobile shop for several repairs will receive a bill that shows the amount of time spent by different mechanics on various parts of the car, as well as their billing rates. The time spent by each mechanic on the car is derived from the work ticket.</p>
