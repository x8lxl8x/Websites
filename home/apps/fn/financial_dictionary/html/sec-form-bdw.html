<h1>SEC Form BDW</h1>

<p>A form that must be completed by all securities broker-dealers and submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in order to terminate status as a registered broker. Form BDW can be used by the broker-dealer to file either a full withdrawal or partial withdrawal. A partial withdrawal terminates a broker's registration within specific jurisdictions and self-regulatory organizations (SRO). However, a partial withdrawal does not terminate its registration with the SEC and at least one SRO and jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The provisions that govern all securities brokers registered with the SEC are covered under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The purpose of the form is to help the SEC determine if it's in the public's best interest for a broker-dealer to withdraw its registration. The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) keep all information provided through file BDW Forms on file and make that information available to the public.</p>
