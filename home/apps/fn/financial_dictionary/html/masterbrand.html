<h1>Masterbrand</h1>

<p>A specific overarching brand name that serves as the main anchoring point on which all underlying products are based. Masterbranding attempts to create a strong association between a company's products and what the brand represents. While individual products will always have their own names/brands, it is the masterbrand that contributes to the consumer's belief that the product is different compared to all others in its class.</p>

<p>For example, Intel is one masterbrand with several subsequent product offerings such as Pentium, Centrino and Core Duo. While each one of these products offers a different level of performance, it is the Intel brand that allows a consumer to believe that the chip he or she purchases will have the same high level of quality as all other Intel products.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of a positive masterbrand is one way for a business to create an economic moat.</p>
