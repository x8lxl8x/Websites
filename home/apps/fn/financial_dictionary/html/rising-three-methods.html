<h1>Rising Three Methods</h1>

<p>A bullish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the continuation of the current uptrend. This pattern is formed when the candlesticks meet the following characteristics:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> The first candle in the pattern is a long white candlestick within a defined uptrend.
<b>2.</b> A series of descending small-bodied candlesticks that trade within the range of the first candlestick.
<b>3.</b> A long white candlestick creates a new high, which suggests that bullish are back in control of the direction.</p>

<p>The series of small-bodied candlesticks are regarded as a period of consolidation before the uptrend is able to continue. This pattern is important because it shows traders that sellers still do not have enough conviction to reverse the trend and it is used by some active traders as a signal to add to their positions.</p>
