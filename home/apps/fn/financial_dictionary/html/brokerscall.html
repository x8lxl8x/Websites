<h1>Broker's Call</h1>

<p>The interest rate charged by banks on loans made to broker-dealers, who use these loan proceeds to make margin loans to their clients. These broker's call loans are payable by the broker-dealer on call (i.e., immediately) upon request from the lending institution. The broker's call rate forms the basis on which margin loans are priced.</p>

<p>The broker's call rate may fluctuate on a daily basis, since it depends on a number of factors such as market interest rates, funds' supply and demand and economic conditions. It is published daily in publications such as <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Investor's Business Daily</i>.</p>
