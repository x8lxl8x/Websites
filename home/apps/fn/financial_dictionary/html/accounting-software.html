<h1>Accounting Software</h1>

<p>Computer programs that assist bookkeepers and accountants in recording and reporting on a firm's financial transactions. The functionality of accounting software differs from product to product. Larger firms may choose to implement a customized solution which integrates a vast amount of data from many different departments. Smaller firms often choose an off the shelf product.</p>

<p>Accounting software is an invaluable resource for modern business. Software allows detailed tracking of financial transactions and near instantaneous reporting and analysis. Before accounting software, these tasks had to be performed by hand, using large transaction journals. Ad hoc reporting was generally impractical due to the labor involved to consolidate the manual entries. Accounting software automates these tasks, reducing the costs of accounting and allowing better financial decision making through timely reporting.</p>
