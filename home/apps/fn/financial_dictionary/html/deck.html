<h1>Deck</h1>

<p>The number of open orders that a broker is working with at any one time. A broker with a large deck must efficiently find buyers and sellers for securities or risk the orders not being filled and canceled. More experienced brokers can operate with larger open positions if they are certain in their ability to find counterparties.</p>

<p>Brokers with a large deck may find holding too many orders to be inefficient because, as a floor trader, the broker must fill both buy and sell orders, meaning that the broker must deal with a number of parties at any one time.</p>
