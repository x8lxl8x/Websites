<h1>Pocket Listing</h1>

<p>Any listing that is retained by a listing broker or salesperson who does not make the listing available to other brokers in the office or to other multiple listing system (MLS) members.</p>

<p>Also referred to as an "exclusive listing."</p>

<p>When a real estate professional is hired to list and sell a property, a listing agreement is in writing. Often real estate agents and brokers agree to cooperate with other agents and brokers and share a portion of the total commission paid by the seller. In a pocket listing, a property will not be listed in a MLS, and therefore there is no agreement to work with other real estate professionals. Reasons for a pocket listing include the seller's desire for privacy or to sell to a certain individual.</p>
