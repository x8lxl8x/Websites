<h1>Cash-Out Refinance</h1>

<p>A mortgage refinancing transaction in which the new mortgage amount is greater than the existing mortgage amount, plus loan settlement costs. The purpose of a cash-out refinance is to extract equity from the borrower's home. A cash-out refinance is an alternative to a home equity loan.</p>

<p>Cash-out refinances are a popular way for borrowers to access the equity in their homes to pay down consumer debt or make additional purchases. Borrowers need to make a risk-based assessment of whether extracting equity from a home is economical. Borrowers also need to be aware that refinancing a mortgage has costs, including the fact that the lender may charge a higher interest rate on a cash-out refinance than a rate-and-term refinance.</p>
