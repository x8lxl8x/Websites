<h1>Credit Application</h1>

<p>A request for an extension of credit, either orally or in written form. The request must follow the lender's extension request procedures in order to be valid. The application must legally contain all pertinent information relating to the cost of the credit, including the annual percentage yield (APY) and all associated fees. Regulation Z of the Federal Reserve governs the credit application process.</p>

<p>A valid credit application will provide the amount and type of credit requested, the applicant's credit score and report and the means of security for the loan. Regulation Z also protects consumers by providing rights to credit card users, such as giving borrowers written disclosure and providing guidelines for acceptable credit advertisements.</p>
