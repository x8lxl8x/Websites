<h1>Conflict Of Interest </h1>

<p>A situation where a professional, or a corporation, has a vested interest which may make them an unreliable source. The interest could be money, status, knowledge or reputation for example. When such a situation arises, the party is usually asked to remove themselves, and it is often legally required of them.</p>

<p>An example of a conflict of interest would be a board member voting on the induction of lower premiums for companies with fleet vehicles when he is the owner of a tow truck company outside of the corporation. In relation to law, representation by a party with a vested interest in the outcome of the trial would be considered conflict of interest, and the representation would not be allowed.</p>
