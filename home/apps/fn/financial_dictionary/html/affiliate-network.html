<h1>Affiliate Network</h1>

<p>Third parties that provide a link between a publisher and a company to allow publishers the ability to find and join afilliate programs. Businesses that comprise an affiliate network can cover a variety of different marketing mediums, such as the internet or direct mail, or can operate in related industries. A company looking to acquire new customers will pay members of its affiliate network for the sales leads that they provide.</p>

<p>Companies use affiliate networks if they do not have the available resources to create a significant outbound sales effort, if they do not have a substantial advertising presence or if they want to tap into groups of potential customers in an unrelated industry. Affiliate networks can allow a business to focus on its core competencies rather than on obtaining the contact information of interested parties.</p>
