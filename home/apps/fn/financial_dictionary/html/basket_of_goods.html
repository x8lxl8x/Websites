<h1>Basket Of Goods</h1>

<p>A relatively fixed set of consumer products and services valued and used on an annual basis to track inflation in a specific market or country. The goods in the basket are often adjusted periodically to account for changes in consumer habits  The basket of goods is used primarily to calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>

<p>When conceptualizing a basket of goods, it is best to imagine a shopping basket. The basket contains everyday products such as food, clothing, furniture and financial services. As the products in the basket increase or decrease in price, the overall value of the basket changes. The CPI compares the value of the basket each year and determines the level of inflation for that period. The contents of the basket are subject to change each year.</p>
