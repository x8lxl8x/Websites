<h1>Ring Fence</h1>

<p>A protection-based transfer of assets from one destination to another, usually through the use of offshore accounting. A ring fence is meant to protect the assets from inclusion in an investor's calculable net worth or to lower tax consequences.</p>

<p>Moves to ring fence an asset are often called "ring fence trades".</p>

<p>There are many legal options available in many countries to ring fence assets, although many have caps that are set at a percentage of one's net worth. The main motivation for moving assets (or capital) into a ring fence is to free it from undue restrictions, tax burdens or other country-specific laws. Property or assets held outside a nation's jurisdiction cannot have claims brought on them, so they become "untouchable" by the investor's home country.</p>
