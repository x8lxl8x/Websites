<h1>Regulation C</h1>

<p>A regulation that implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. Regulation C mandates that depository institutions must annually disclose the communities to which they provided residential mortgages. This allows regulatory authorities to evaluate whether the lender is adequately meeting the needs of the prospective borrowers in that community.</p>

<p>Any lending institution with total assets of $10 million or less is exempt from Regulation C. All providers of mortgages that are backed by the government in any capacity must annually reveal the quantity and dollar amounts of all mortgages provided within the past year. These loans must be broken down by census tract in which the properties are located.</p>
