<h1>Closed-End Credit</h1>

<p>A loan or extension of credit in which the proceeds are dispersed in full when the loan closes and must be repaid, including any interest and finance charges, by a specified date. The loan may require periodic principal and interest payments, or may require the entire payment of principal at maturity.</p>

<p>In this type of loan or credit arrangement, the full amount owed must be paid back by the borrower by a set point in time. Most real estate and auto loans are closed-end credit, while credit cards and home-equity lines of credit are open-end or revolving lines of credit.</p>
