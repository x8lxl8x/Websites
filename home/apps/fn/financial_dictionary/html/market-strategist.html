<h1>Market Strategist</h1>

<p>A financial professional whose job is to make predictions about what will happen in the financial markets with the goal of guiding people toward profitable investment decisions. Market strategists use financial and economic data to attempt to anticipate everything from future stock performance to the federal funds rate to the return on 10-year Treasuries to which economic sectors will have the best and worst performance for the year.</p>

<p>Investment banks, brokerage firms and financial services companies commonly employ market strategists. Despite what these professionals claim, it is not actually possible to predict the movement of stocks and other financial instruments. According to William J. Bernstein's book "The Four Pillars of Investing," market strategists have historically been incorrect about 77% of the time.</p>
