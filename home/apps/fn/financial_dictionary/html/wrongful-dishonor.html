<h1>Wrongful Dishonor</h1>

<p>A bank's failure to honor a valid negotiable instrument such as a cheque or draft that has been presented to it for payment. If the cheque is valid and there are sufficient funds in the account to cover it, a bank's failure to honor it within the time period stipulated by the Uniform Commercial Code would constitute wrongful dishonor.</p>

<p>A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages caused by wrongful dishonor of an instrument. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include potential consequential damages.</p>
