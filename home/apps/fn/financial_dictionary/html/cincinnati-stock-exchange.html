<h1>Cincinnati Stock Exchange - CSE</h1>

<p>A securities exchange formed in 1885 by a group of Cincinnati businessmen. The CSE's headquarters moved to Chicago in 1995, and in 2003 the CSE changed its name to the National Stock Exchange (NSX) and now maintains its headquarters in New Jersey. The NSX is also best known for it's listings of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>

<p>In 1980, the CSE replaced its physical trading floor with a much more efficient geographically dispersed electronic trading floor because of amendments made in 1975 to the Securities and Exchange Act. In 1986, the CSE became the first fully electronic exchange in the United States, capable of automatically executing orders through the Intermarket Trading System. The CSE was also the first exchange to introduce a competing specialist system, in 1992.</p>
