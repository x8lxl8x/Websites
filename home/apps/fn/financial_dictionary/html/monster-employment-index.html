<h1>Monster Employment Index</h1>

<p>An index created by information collected from job postings on more than 1,500 job search websites (including Monster.com in the U.S.). The Monster Employment Index tracks job availability to help provide insight on the strength of the economy.</p>

<p>The Monster Employment Index, like any other job availability index, provides information on how many jobs employers are looking to fill. A high index figure could be interpreted as a shortage of workers, which could be bad for the bond markets due to wage inflation. Drastic increases in employee wages could create price inflation. The stock markets, on the other hand, would prefer to see a rising employment index. Increases in job demand can be seen as an indicator of a healthy economy.</p>
