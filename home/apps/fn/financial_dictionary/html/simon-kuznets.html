<h1>Simon Kuznets</h1>

<p>A Russian-American economist and statistician who won the 1971 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on economic growth. He also set the standard for economic research on national income, computing GNP for the United States all the way back to 1869. His measurements of savings, consumption and investment contributed to Keynesian economics and to econometrics. Kuznets also analyzed trade cycles that are referred to as "Kuznets cycles."</p>

<p>Kuznets was born in Ukraine in 1901. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University and was a professor of economics and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins and a professor of economics at Harvard. He died in 1985 in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
