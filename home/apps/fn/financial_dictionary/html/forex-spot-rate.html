<h1>Forex Spot Rate</h1>

<p>The current exchange rate at which a currency pair can be bought or sold. The spot forex rate differs from the forward rate in that it prices the value of currencies compared to foreign currencies today, rather than at some time in the future. The spot rate in forex currency trading, is the rate that most traders use when trading with an online retail forex broker.</p>

<p>Although the forex spot rate calls for delivery within two days, this rarely occurs. Traders that hold a position for longer than two days will have their trades "reset" by the broker, i.e. closed and reopened at the same price, just prior to the two-day deadline.</p>
