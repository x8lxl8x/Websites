<h1>Paydown</h1>

<p>This occurs when the amount a company or government repays in debt exceeds the amount they currently borrow. A Paydown takes place when a company reissues unpaid debt for less than the initial issue. For example, if a company pays $8,000,000 in corporate bond maturities and issues $5,000,000 in new bonds then the company has $3,000,000 less in debt because it has paid down its debt.</p>

<p>Paydown is also when a mortgage borrower pays the principal and interest of a mortgage. In doing so, the borrower is paying down his or her debt. In general, Paydown also refers to repayment of any outstanding loan. It could mean paying down a car loan, credit card debt, school loan or any other type of debt.</p>
