<h1>Asset Mix</h1>

<p>The classification of all assets within a fund or portfolio. Assets are assigned to one of the core asset classes: stocks (equities), bonds (fixed income), cash and real estate. Other categories that are sometimes considered asset classes are commodities, international investments, hedge funds and limited partnership interests.</p>

<p>The asset mix is usually shown as the set of percentages every asset class contributes to the total market value of the portfolio. It is a key determinant of the risk/reward profile of the fund, which in turn is largely determinant of long-term performance results.</p>

<p>Investors can expect the asset mixes of funds within a given strategy - such as capital-appreciation funds, "balanced" funds, income funds and life-cycle funds - to be similar to each other.</p>

<p>Portfolio managers use the historical averages for different asset classes' returns to determine the right mix of asset classes for the fund, whether the right mix is to hold a very high percentage of bonds (income-seeking investors, retirees) or to invest primarily in small-cap equities (capital-appreciation/aggressive-growth funds).</p>

<p>This applies to individual investors as well - the right asset mix will depend on the unique circumstances of the investor, including risk tolerance, desire for income, time horizon, tax liabilities and liquidity needs.</p>
