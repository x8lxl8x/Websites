<h1>Automated Forex Trading</h1>

<p>A method of trading foreign currencies with a computer program that is based on a set of analyses that helps determine whether to buy or sell a currency pair at any one time. Automated forex trading uses a computer program that the trader "teaches" to make decisions based on a set of signals derived from technical analysis charting tools. The signals create a buy or sell decision when they point in the same direction.</p>

<p>In an automated forex trading system, the trader must teach the software what signals to look for and how to interpret them. It is thought that automated trading takes human psychology out of trading.</p>

<p>Automated day trading systems and signals are available to purchase over the internet. However, it is important to note that there is no such thing as the "holy grail" of trading systems. If the system was a perfect money maker, the seller would not want to share it. This is why big financial firms keep their "black box" trading programs under lock and key.</p>
