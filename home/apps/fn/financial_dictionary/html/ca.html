<h1>Chartered Accountant - CA</h1>

<p>An accounting designation given to accounting professionals in many countries around the world outside of the United States. A Chartered Accountant (CA) designation typically proves the holder has the qualifications to audit financial statements and business practices as well as offer advisory services to client√®le. The equivalent to a CA designation in the U.S. is the CPA.</p>

<p>Chartered Accountants claim to be the first accounting group to form a professional body, in 1854 in Britain. Today there are many organizations that such accountants belong to across the world, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales in the UK and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada. The CA designation in Canada is one of the few designations transferable to a CPA in the U.S. by writing a reciprocity exam.</p>
