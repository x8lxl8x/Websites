<h1>Availability Schedule</h1>

<p>The number of days it takes for a third-party check deposited into a customer's checking account to become available to the customer. While the funds are unavailable until cleared, they are referred to as "checks held".</p>

<p>The maximum number of days that funds can be held by banks is dictated by the Expedited Funds Availability Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1987 and subsequently became a Federal Reserve regulation. Many banks will make checks available before the maximum number of days is up.</p>
