<h1>Total Cost Of Ownership - TCO</h1>

<p>The purchase price of an asset plus the costs of operation. When choosing among alternatives in a purchasing decision, buyers should look not just at an item's short-term price, which is its purchase price, but also at its long-term price, which is its total cost of ownership. The item with the lower total cost of ownership will be the better value in the long run.<i> </i></p>

<p>For example, the total cost of ownership of a car is not just the purchase price, but also the expenses incurred through its use, such as repairs, insurance and fuel. A used car that appears to be a great bargain might actually have a total cost of ownership that is higher than that of a new car, if the used car requires numerous repairs while the new car has a three-year warranty.<i> </i></p>
