<h1>On Stream</h1>

<p>An investment that is on track to earn its expected return. Stocks, funds or any other investment vehicle that is presently performing in a way that allows it to reach the same target that was initially set. However, just because these investments are on their way to reach their targets, doesn't mean they actually will.</p>

<p>Despite these investments being on stream, there is no guarantee the targets will be achieved. Whether or not investments are currently on stream, investors looking to invest stocks or funds have to research these thoroughly and make sure they are prepared to withstand drops and potential losses in their investments, due to price fluctuations.</p>
