<h1>StochRSI</h1>

<p>An indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one and is created by applying the Stochastic Oscillator formula to a set of Relative Strength Index (RSI) values rather than standard price data. Using RSI values within the Stochastic formula gives traders an idea of whether the current RSI value is overbought or oversold - a measure that becomes specifically useful when the RSI value is confined between its signal levels of 20 and 80.</p>

<p>The StochRSI is deemed to be oversold when the value drops below 0.20, meaning the RSI value is trading at the lower end of its predefined range, and that the short-term direction of underlying security may be nearing a correction. Conversely, a reading above 0.80 suggests the RSI may be reaching extreme levels and could be used to signal a pullback in the underlying security.</p>
