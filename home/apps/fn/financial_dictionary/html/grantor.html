<h1>Grantor</h1>

<p>1. A seller of either call or put options who profits from the premium for which the options are sold. Synonymous with option writer.</p>

<p>2. The creator of a trust, meaning the individual whose assets are put into the trust.</p>

<p>1. For example, say a writer has sold a call option, or assumed a short position in a call option. If the call option is exercised, then the writer has to sell the underlying stock at the strike price Conversely, if the writer sells a put option, he or she is said to be long, and must purchase the underlying stock at the strike price. Being a writer is relatively risky - especially on a naked position. This technique should not be used by those who are new to option markets.</p>

<p>2. The grantor is the person who creates the trust, and the beneficiaries are the persons identified in the trust to receive the assets.</p>
