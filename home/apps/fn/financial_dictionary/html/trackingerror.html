<h1>Tracking Error</h1>

<p>A divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark. This is often in the context of a hedge or mutual fund that did not work as effectively as intended, creating an unexpected profit or loss instead.</p>

<p>Tracking errors are reported as a "standard deviation percentage" difference. This measure reports the difference between the return an investor receives and that of the benchmark he or she was attempting to imitate.</p>
