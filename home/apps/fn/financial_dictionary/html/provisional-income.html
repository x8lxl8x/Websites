<h1>Provisional Income</h1>

<p>The level of income that is used to determine whether a taxpayer is liable for tax on his or her Social Security benefits, and by how much. Provisional income is calculated by making certain adjustments to the taxpayer's gross income.</p>

<p>The formula for determining provisional income is as follows:</p>

<p>Provisional income = gross income + tax-free interest + 50% of Social Security benefits + any tax-free fringe benefits and exclusions - adjustments to income (except for the student loan deduction, tuition and fees deduction or domestic production-activities deduction)</p>

<p>Provisional income is calculated on Worksheet 34-1, unless the taxpayer is an active participant in a qualified plan and also has made or intends to make deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA for the year.</p>

<p>If the taxpayer's provisional income exceeds a certain base amount, then part of the taxpayer's Social Security benefits may become taxable.</p>
