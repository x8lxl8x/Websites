<h1>China Europe International Business School - CEIBS</h1>

<p>A school of international business located in Shanghai, China. China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) offers one of the top-ranked MBA programs in China and is among the top 25 programs in the world. Its executive MBA program is one of the largest in the world.</p>

<p>CEIBS stands alone as the only business school on mainland China. For this reason, the Chinese government designated its property as a "Special Education Zone."
