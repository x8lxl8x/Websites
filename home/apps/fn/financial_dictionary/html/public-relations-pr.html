<h1>Public Relations - PR</h1>

<p>The act of communicating with the public. Although not inherent in the definition, public relations, or "PR" for short, is often thought of as "spin," with the goal being to present the person, company or event in the best light possible. Most major companies have a PR department or utilize the services of an outside firm.</p>

<p>Public relations are often a crucial part of a company's success - or failure. In addition to handling media requests, information queries and shareholder concerns, PR personnel are frequently responsible for crafting and maintaining the corporation's image.</p>
