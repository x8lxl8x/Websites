<h1>Junior Mortgage</h1>

<p>A mortgage that is subordinate to a first or prior (senior) mortgage. A junior mortgage often refers to a second mortgage, but it could also be a third or fourth mortgage. In the case of foreclosure, the senior mortgage will be paid down first.</p>

<p>Common uses of junior mortgages include piggy-back mortgages (80-10-10 mortgages) and home equity loans. Piggy-back mortgages provide a way for borrowers with less than a 20% down payment to avoid costly private mortgage insurance. Home equity loans are frequently used to extract equity for a home to pay down other debts or make additional purchases. Every borrowing scenario should be carefully and thoroughly analyzed.</p>
