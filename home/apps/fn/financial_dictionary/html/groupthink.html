<h1>Groupthink</h1>

<p>A phenomenon developed in groups and marked by the consensus of opinion without critical reasoning or evaluation of consequences or alternatives. Groupthink evolves around a common desire to not upset the balance of a group of people by creating conflict, with creativity and individuality considered potentially harmful traits that should be avoided.</p>

<p>Groupthink in a business setting can cause employees and their bosses to overlook potential problems in the pursuit of consensus thinking. Because individual critical thinking is deemphasized or frowned upon, employees may self-censor themselves and not bring up alternatives or risks for fear of upsetting the status quo.</p>
