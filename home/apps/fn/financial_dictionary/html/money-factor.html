<h1>Money Factor</h1>

<p>The alternative method of presenting the amount of interest charged on a lease with monthly payments. A money factor can be translated into the more common annual percentage rate (APR) interest by multiplying the money factor by 2,400.</p>

<p>Also known as a "lease factor".</p>

<p>For example, if quoted a money factor of .002, the interest rate on that loan would be approximately (.002) x 2,400 = 4.8%</p>

<p>Money factors are used in cases where the monthly payments may fluctuate based on the residual value of an asset, such as an auto lease. In a typical lease, the investor is paying the difference between the retail value of the automobile and the interest payments.</p>

<p>A money factor may also be presented as a factor of 100, such as "2.0" rather than ".002".  While the decimal version is more common, a money factor that is a whole number can still be converted to an APR by multiplying it by 24.</p>
