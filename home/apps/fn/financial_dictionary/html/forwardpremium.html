<h1>Forward Premium</h1>

<p>When dealing with foreign exchange (FX), a situation where the spot futures exchange rate, with respect to the domestic currency, is trading at a higher spot exchange rate then it is currently. A forward premium is frequently measured as the difference between the current spot rate and the forward rate, but any expected future exchange rate will suffice.</p>

<p>It is a reasonable assumption to make that the future spot rate will be equal to the current futures rate. According to the forward expectation's theory of exchange rates, the current spot futures rate will be the future spot rate. This theory is routed in empirical studies and is a reasonable assumption to make in the long term.</p>
