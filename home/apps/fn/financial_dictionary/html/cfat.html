<p>Also known as "After-Tax Cash Flow".
CFAT is important for investors because it gauges a corporation's ability to pay dividends. The higher the CFAT, the better positioned a business is to make distributions. CFAT also measures the company's financial health and performance over time and in comparison to competitors.           </p>
