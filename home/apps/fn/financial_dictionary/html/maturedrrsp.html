<h1>Matured RRSP</h1>

<p>A Canadian retirement savings vehicle that is registered with the Canadian government and is being used to produce retirement income for the beneficiary.</p>

<p>Though a matured RRSP is similar to an RRIF in the sense that they both pay retirement income to the beneficiary, an RRIF has been transferred to a carrier, re-registered with the government as a different registered financial instrument and makes regular payments to the annuitant. A matured RRSP does not make payments. In order for the beneficiary to get money out of a matured RRSP, he or she must make periodic withdrawals.</p>
