<h1>Dow Jones Asian Titans 50 Index</h1>

<p>A market capitalization-weighted index of Asia-Pacific stocks designed to capture the blue-chip leaders of the region. The stock universe is the Dow Jones Asia-Pacific Index, from which the 50 largest Japan-based and 50 largest non-Japan based stocks are selected.</p>

<p>The two lists of 50 stocks are given final rankings based 60% on market cap, 20% on current revenues and 20% on current net income levels. The top 25 members are then chosen from each list for the Asian Titans Index, half of which will be made up of Japan-based companies.</p>

<p>The index is reconstituted annually, with quarterly weighting updates to account for changes in market capitalization in the member stocks.</p>

<p>Japan is often a large component of any Asia-Pacific index due to the maturity of its economy and stock exchange.The country dominates the top ranks of the Asian Titans 50 Index.</p>
