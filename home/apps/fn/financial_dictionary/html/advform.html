<h1>ADV Form</h1>

<p>A required submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by a professional investment advisor that specifies the investment style, assets under management and key officers of the firm. The form must be updated annually and be made available as public record for companies managing in excess of $25 million.</p>

<p>Form ADV is divided into two parts. The first discloses specific information about an RIA that is important to regulators (name, number of employees, form of the organization, nature of the business, etc.). The second part acts as a disclosure document for clients of the business and includes information such as services provided and fees levied, whether the investment advisor acts as a broker-dealer and transacts securities, and so on.</p>

<p>To request a copy of Form ADV, you can usually contact the SEC branch closest to you. Potential and current clients of an investment advisor should always review the ADV Form on file, as it provides transparent evidence of the asset mix within the firm, as well as the professional backgrounds of key personnel.</p>

<p>Most advisors will offer a current Form ADV to any potential client early in the marketing process; in fact, investors should be immediately cautious of an advisor that does not freely offer the form upon request.</p>
