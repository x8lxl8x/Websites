<h1>Bureau of Economic Analysis - BEA</h1>

<p>A division of the U.S. federal government's Department of Commerce that is responsible for the analysis and reporting of economic data used to confirm and predict economic trends and business cycles. Reports from the Bureau of Economic Analysis are the foundation upon which many economic policy decisions are made by government, and many investment decisions are made in the private sector by companies and individual investors.</p>

<p>Among the most influential statistics analyzed and reported by the BEA are the gross domestic product data and the balance of trade for the United States. The BEA uses data collected at local, state, federal and international levels. Furthermore, the BEA collects data on foreign direct and indirect investment in the U.S. and on individual industries that operate around the globe.</p>
