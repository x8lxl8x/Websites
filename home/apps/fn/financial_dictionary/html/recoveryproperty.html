<h1>Recovery Property</h1>

<p>A specific class of depreciable real estate. Recovery property describes tangible depreciable property placed in service between 1980-1987, and is eligible for Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) treatment. The ACRS election was allowed on a property-by-property basis.</p>

<p>The ACRS recovery period for recovery property has long-since expired, and all real estate that qualified as recovery property is now fully depreciated. As a result, any ACRS recovery property that is now declared on a tax return should be carefully investigated to ensure validity. ACRS was replaced by the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) in 1986.</p>
