<h1>Time Arbitrage</h1>

<p>An opportunity created when a stock misses its mark and is sold based on a short-term outlook with little change in the long-term prospects of the company. This miss occurs when a company fails to meet earnings estimates by analysts or its guidance, resulting in a short-term stumble where the price of the stock decreases. Some investors use time arbitrage to increase their chances of outperforming the market.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of time arbitrage. Generally speaking, single misses do not mean a company is in trouble, and there is often a good chance of a rebound long term. However, if the misses become habitual, time arbitrage may actually be a losing proposition. Essentially, time arbitrage is another version of the old advice, "buy on bad news, sell on good."</p>
