<h1>Lifeline Account</h1>

<p>A streamlined checking or savings account designed for low-income customers. These accounts will usually have low balance requirements and no monthly fees, and are offered by large banking institutions as a way to offer basic banking services to the broad public. Some states mandate that lifeline accounts be available within the state.</p>

<p>Basic features such as check writing will be available, but will typically be limited by a monthly quota. Other electronic services may also be limited unless the account holder pays additional fees.</p>

<p>Lifeline accounts aim to bring all members of a society into the economy by encouraging saving and long-term investing. Low-income citizens are often ignored in the economy because they don't have a lot of disposable income, but by fostering their long-term financial health, they can become bigger contributors down the road.</p>
