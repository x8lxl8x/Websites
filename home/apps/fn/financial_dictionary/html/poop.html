<h1>Poop</h1>

<p>A slang term often used to describe inside information or people with insider information. A poop has access to nonpublic information, which can be used to their advantage. Investors are not allowed to trade on material insider information. If they do, they could face penalties or even jail time.</p>

<p>Although not the most illustrious name, poop usually refers to the actual information, but it could be used to describe anyone with insider information including a director of a company, the wife of an employee or even the next-door neighbor. If a person has insider information they would be considered a poop.</p>
