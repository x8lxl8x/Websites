<h1>Negative Pledge Clause</h1>

<p>A negative covenant in an indenture stating that the corporation will not pledge any of its assets if doing so gives the lenders less security. Also be referred to as a "covenant of equal coverage".</p>

<p>A negative pledge clause is just another way for bondholders to protect their investment.  By including a negative pledge clause in a bond indenture, the bondholders of the current bond issue prevent the company from issuing any debt in the future which would jeopardize their current priority claim on the company's assets.</p>

<p>Including a negative pledge cause in a bond indenture increases the safety of the bond issue from the investors' perspective, and therefore often allows the bond issuer to borrow funds at a slightly lower interest rate.</p>
