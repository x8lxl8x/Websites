<h1>Current Income</h1>

<p>The investment objective for a moderately conservative portfolio of securities or mutual funds that provides high dividend and annuity payments to satisfy an investor's steady income requirements.</p>

<p>Current income portfolios are often created for individuals in their retirement years because steady income is needed for living expenses. Income garnered from a current income fund is derived from bond interest payments, dividends and annuity payments.</p>

<p>A current income portfolio is moderately conservative, as it often contains a large percentage of fixed-income securities, in addition to other assets such as blue-chip stocks and annuities. A current income portfolio can also include mutual funds within the same asset categories and strategies, such as a government bond fund and a dividend fund.</p>
