<h1>Operating Cash Flow Demand - OCFD</h1>

<p>A measure of the amount of operating cash flow needed to meet the capital costs of a company's strategic investments. This value is used to compute the cash value added of a company's strategic investments and operations.
A strategic investment is any investment in a game plan. The operating cash flow demand is the amount of cash flow needed for each strategic investment to have a net present value of zero, or achieve minimum profitability. For example, if a company's strategic investment is the purchase of a plant in a new market, the OCFD would be the minimum amount of cash that the plant would need to generate over its life to meet the return required by investors.           </p>
