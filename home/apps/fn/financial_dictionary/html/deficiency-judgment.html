<h1>Deficiency Judgment</h1>

<p>A judgment made by a court against a debtor indicating that the sale on a foreclosed piece of property did not cover the outstanding mortgage in full. It is a lien placed on the debtor for further money. A deficiency judgment is not considered by the court unless the lender makes a motion for it to be granted. If the lender does not make the motion, then the court considers the money gained from the foreclosed property to be sufficient.</p>

<p>A debtor who receives a deficiency judgment may seek exemption from the lender or other creditors, file a motion to have the judgment overturned or, if necessary, declare bankruptcy. Before making any decisions pertaining to a deficiancy judgment, defendants would be best advised to contact an attorney.</p>
