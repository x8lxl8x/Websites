<h1>Nonprofit Organization</h1>

<p>A business entity that is granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. Donations to a nonprofit organization are often tax deductible to the individuals and businesses making the contributions. Nonprofit organizations must disclose a great deal of financial and operating information to the public, so that donors can ensure their contributions are used effectively.</p>

<p>Nonprofit organizations are also called 501(c)(3) organizations after the section of the tax code that allows them.</p>

<p>Nonprofit organizations don't pay income tax on the money they earn from fundraising activities or donations. The organization must further a religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, public safety, amateur sports or cruelty prevention purpose to qualify for tax-exempt status; it must also provide a public benefit. Examples of nonprofit organizations include churches, hospitals and schools.</p>
