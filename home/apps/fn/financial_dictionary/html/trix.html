<h1>Triple Exponential Average - TRIX</h1>

<p>A momentum indicator used by technical traders that shows the percentage change in a triple exponentially smoothed moving average. When Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) is applied to triple smoothing of moving averages, it is designed to filter out price movements that are considered insignificant or unimportant. TRIX is also implemented by technical traders to produce signals that are similar in nature to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).</p>

<p>Developed by Jack Hutson in the early 1980s, TRIX has become a popular technical analysis tool to aid chartists in spotting diversions and directional cues in stock trading patterns. Although many consider TRIX to be very similar to MACD, the primary difference between the two is that TRIX outputs are smoother due to the triple smoothing of the exponential moving average (EMA).</p>
