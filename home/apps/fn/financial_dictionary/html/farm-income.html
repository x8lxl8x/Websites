<h1>Farm Income</h1>

<p>Farm income refers to profits and losses incurred through the operation of a farm. A farm income statement (sometimes called a farm profit and loss statement) is a summary of income and expenses that occurred during a specified accounting period. This period is usually the calendar year for farmers (January 1 - December 31).</p>

<p>In U.S. agricultural policy, farm income can be divided as follows:</p>

<p><b>Gross Cash Income</b>: the sum of all receipts from the sale of crops, livestock and farm related goods and services, as well as any direct payments from the government.</p>

<p><b>Gross Farm Income</b>: the same as gross cash income with the addition of non-money income, such as the value of home consumption of self-produced food.</p>

<p><b>Net Cash Income</b>: the gross cash income less all cash expenses, such as for feed, seed, fertilizer, property taxes, interest on debt, wagers, contract labor and rent to non-operator landlords.</p>

<p><b>Net Farm Income</b>: the gross farm income less cash expenses and non-cash expenses, such as capital consumption and farm household expenses.</p>

<p><b>Net Cash Income</b>: a short-term measure of cash flow.</p>
