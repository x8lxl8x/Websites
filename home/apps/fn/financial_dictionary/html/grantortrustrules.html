<h1>Grantor Trust Rules</h1>

<p>Guidelines that state a trust is considered to be a grantor trust if the grantor has a reversionary interest greater than 5% of the trust assets (at the time the transfer of assets to the trust is made). If a trust is considered to be a grantor trust, then the income from the trust will be taxed to the grantor, and not to the trust.</p>

<p>Because the tax rates for trusts are much higher than for individuals, the grantor will often retain a revisionary interest in the trust so that the trust income is taxed at the grantor's rate instead of at the trust level.</p>

<p>If the grantor so chooses, a grantor trust may be amended so the grantor is no longer eligible to receive the benefits or able to control the trust, then the trust will effectively become a irrevocable trust. This will result in more taxes being paid on any income that is taxable to the trust, and not the beneficiaries.</p>
