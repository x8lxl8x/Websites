<h1>Turnover Ratio</h1>

<p>The percentage of a mutual fund or other investment vehicle's holdings that have been "turned over" or replaced with other holdings in a given year. The type of mutual fund, its investment objective and/or the portfolio manager's investing style will play an important role in determining its turnover ratio.</p>

<p>For example, a stock index fund will have a low turnover rate, but a bond fund, whether passively or actively managed, will have high turnover because active trading is an inherent quality of bond investments. An aggressive small-cap growth stock fund will generally experience higher turnover than a large-cap value stock fund.</p>

<p>All things being equal, investors should favor low turnover funds. High turnover equates to higher brokerage transaction fees, which reduce fund returns. Also, the more portfolio turnover in a fund, the more likely it will generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor's ordinary income rate.</p>

<p>Turnover ratios for a mutual fund will vary from year to year, but the general range can be assessed by looking at the figure over a few consecutive years.</p>
