<h1>Foot Traffic</h1>

<p>The presence and movement of people walking around in a particular space. Foot traffic is important to many types of businesses, particularly retail establishments, as higher foot traffic can lead to higher sales. Strategies businesses can use to increase their foot traffic include holding grand openings and other promotional events such as demonstrations, giveaways, sales and charitable fundraisers.</p>

<p>Foot traffic is also an important consideration in urban planning. If an area is or is expected to become popular with pedestrians, planners will want to ensure proper design and placement of buildings along with safety factors to protect pedestrians from vehicles such as street trees, crosswalks and extended curbs.</p>
