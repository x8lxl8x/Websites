<h1>Servant Leadership</h1>

<p>A leadership philosophy in which an individual interacts with others - either in a management or fellow employee capacity - with the aim of achieving authority rather than power. The authority figure intends to promote the well-being of those around him/her. Servant leadership involves the individual demonstrating the characteristics of empathy, listening, stewardship and commitment to personal growth toward others.</p>

<p>Servant leadership seeks to move management and personnel interaction away from "controlling activities" and toward a more synergistic relationship between parties. The term "servant leadership" was coined by Robert Greenleaf, a twentieth century researcher who was skeptical about traditional leadership styles that focused on more authoritarian relationships between employers and employees.</p>
