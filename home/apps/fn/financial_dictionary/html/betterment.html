<h1>Betterment</h1>

<p>A type of action or cost expenditure that contributes towards improving an asset's performance and/or increasing its value. Betterments do not include general maintenance-related actions that seek to sustain an asset's current value.</p>

<p>For example, fixing a garage door would not be betterment, but adding an automatic garage-door opener to the garage would be, because the new door will add value to the home.</p>

<p>An example of betterment in business would be replacing an outdated piece of equipment with a new piece that increases a manufacturing facility's production capacity. In this case, the overall asset's value (the manufacturing facility) is greater than its value would have been had it kept the old equipment.</p>
