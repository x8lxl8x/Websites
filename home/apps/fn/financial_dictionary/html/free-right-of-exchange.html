<h1>Free Right Of Exchange</h1>

<p>An investor's right to transfer an asset to another party without incurring any transaction fees on the exchange. Unlike a sales transaction, the investor is either giving away or trading stock and should not be taxed on the transaction.</p>

<p>The free right of exchange plays an important role in the gifting or donation of stock. Making a charitable donation of stock will allow you to avoid any capital gains tax that has been accruing on the asset because the transaction is not taxable as a sale.</p>

<p>Exchange funds capitalize on the free right of exchange by allowing investors to trade larger holdings of a single stock for diversified units in a portfolio. Because the stock is swapped, no transaction or sales costs are associated with the exchange. This allows an investor to balance his or her portfolio while avoiding capital gains tax.</p>
