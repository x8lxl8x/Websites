<h1>Demolition Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance that is used to cover the costs of demolishing a building that is damaged by a peril, such as a fire or storm. Zoning requirements or building codes may require that a damaged building be demolished rather than repaired. Demolition insurance covers the cost of tearing down undamaged portions of a damaged structure.</p>

<p>Demolition insurance covers a building that is damaged, not necessarily pieces of a building that may cover the property itself after a storm or other peril. Property owners should also check their property insurance policies for a debris removal provision, which covers the cost of removing debris and pollution that may result from demolition.</p>
