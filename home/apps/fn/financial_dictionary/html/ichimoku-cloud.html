<h1>Ichimoku Cloud</h1>

<p>A chart used in technical analysis that shows support and resistance, and momentum and trend directions for a security or investment. It is designed to provide relevant information at a glance using moving averages (tenkan-sen and kijun-sen) to show bullish and bearish crossover points. The "clouds" (kumo, in Japanese) are formed between spans of the average of the tenkan-sen and kijun-sen plotted six months ahead (senkou span B), and of the midpoint of the 52-week high and low (senkou span B) plotted six months ahead.</p>

<p>The ichimoku cloud was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a Japanese journalist, and published in the late 1960s. It provides more data points than the standard candlestick chart.</p>

<p>The overall trend is up when prices are above the cloud, down when prices are below the cloud and flat when they are in the cloud itself. When senkou span A is rising above senkou span B the trend is stronger upward, and is typically colored green. When senkou span B rises above senkou span A, the trend is stronger downward and is denoted with a red-colored cloud.</p>
