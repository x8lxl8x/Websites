<h1>Attained Age</h1>

<p>1) The age at which the beneficiary of an insurance policy, retirement plan or other aged-dependent plan, is able to receive benefits or withdraw funds. Attained age can be any age at which benefits are received. In some cases, the person may have to take action when he reaches the attained age, such as retiring from a company.</p>

<p>2) An individual policy holder's age at a specific point in time. Attained age can be used to calculate pricing in policies that set payments according to the policy holder's age. Typically, the pricing increases as the policy holder ages.</p>

<p>1) Various ages are used as the attained age, as in the age of majority or retirement.</p>

<p>2) Attained age pricing adjusts pricing according to age. The older the policy holder, the more that policy holder pays to remain covered. This type of policy may have lower initial expenses, but may become more expensive than issue-age pricing or community-rated pricing as the policy holder ages.</p>
