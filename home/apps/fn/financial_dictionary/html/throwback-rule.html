<h1>Throwback Rule</h1>

<p>A measure states can adopt to ensure corporations pay state taxes on 100% of their profits. Traditional state apportionment formulas base state corporate taxes on a formula that considers where a corporation's property, payroll and sales are located. These formulas result in "nowhere income," or income on which a corporation does not pay tax in any state. The throwback rule is meant to eliminate this tax loophole.</p>

<p>Critics consider traditional apportionment formulas unfair to small businesses that have profits that are 100% taxable because all of their business activities are located in a single state. These businesses end up paying taxes on a greater percentage of their profits than some multi-state corporations do. Critics also think that multi-state corporations with "nowhere income" are burdening state residents by not paying for their fair share of public services, and that the corporate income tax has declined significantly as a source of state revenue as a result of the "nowhere income" loophole.</p>
