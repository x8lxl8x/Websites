<h1>Rebound</h1>

<p>In financial terms, a rebound means a recovery from prior negative activity. For a security, a rebound means that it has moved higher from a lower price. For the general economy, a rebound means that economic activity has increased from lower levels, like the bounce back following a recession.</p>

<p>A recession is defined by economists as two consecutive quarters of economic growth. Recessions are part of the business cycle which consists of: expansion, peak, recession, trough and recovery. A rebound from a recession would occur in the recovery stage.</p>
