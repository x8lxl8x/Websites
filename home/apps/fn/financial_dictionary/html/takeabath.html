<h1>Take A Bath</h1>

<p>A slang term referring to the situation of an investor who has experienced a large loss from an investment or speculative position. Investors whose shares have declined significantly are said to have taken a bath.
For example, following the technology boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many investors, because of their huge losses, were said to have taken a bath.           </p>
