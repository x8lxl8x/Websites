<h1>Adjusted Gross Income - AGI</h1>

<p>A measure of income used to determine how much of your income is taxable. Adjusted gross income (AGI) is calculated as your gross income from taxable sources minus allowable deductions, such as unreimbursed business expenses, medical expenses, alimony and deductible retirement plan contributions.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "net income."</p>

<p>Your AGI is figured on Page 1 of your federal tax return, and it is used to establish eligibility for financial benefits such as IRA contribution deduction limits and social security benefits.</p>
