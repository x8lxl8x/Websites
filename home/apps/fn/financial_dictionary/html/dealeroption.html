<h1>Dealer Option</h1>

<p>An option issued on the physical inventory of a commodity. A dealer option is typically issued by companies that buy, sell or otherwise use a commodity in conducting business. This type of option is not traded on an exchange, meaning that it is traded as an over-the-counter security, and thus are less subject to scrutiny and regulation.</p>

<p>These options are typically written by firms such as clearing houses, which hold the physical commodities and offer them to the public on the over-the-counter market. While dealer options exist outside of traditional trading markets, their sale is still heavily scrutinized because they represent a contract between parties.</p>
