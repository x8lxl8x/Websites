<h1>Business Recovery Risk</h1>

<p>A company's exposure to loss as a result of damage to its ability to conduct day-to-day operations. Analysis of business recovery risk involves categorizing threats according to their short-, medium- and long-term impact. Companies typically include an analysis of business recovery risk in their business continuation plans.</p>

<p>Short-term impact threats may include damage to computer systems or workers' inability to reach the job site. Medium-term impact threats may include infrastructure failure or loss of staff. Long-term impact threats may include extensive property damage.</p>

<p>Business recovery risk is generally not as damaging as disaster recovery risk, in which wide-scale damage may affect the company's ability to access infrastructure, prevent personnel from doing their jobs for extended periods, or destroy company facilities.</p>
