<h1>Condominium Fee</h1>

<p>A maintenance fee charged by a condominium complex to cover the cost of repairs, landscaping, concierges, or amenities such as a gym or a pool. The condominium fee can be pegged to the size of the unit and what the development expects its expenses to be for the year. If expenses are expected to rise, so too will the condominium fees.</p>

<p>Condominium fees are often one of the larger hidden fees that condo buyers neglect to fully take into account. Even if you own the condo outright you may still have to pay condominium fees in perpetuity. If the condo development does not have a reserve fund set aside for emergency repairs you may also wind up being hit with a special assessment fee.</p>
