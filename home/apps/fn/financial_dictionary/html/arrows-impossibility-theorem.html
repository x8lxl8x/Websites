<h1>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</h1>

<p>A social-choice paradox illustrating the impossibility of having an ideal voting structure that is reflective of specific fairness criteria, such as Pareto efficiency. Arrow's impossibility theorem states that a clear order of preferences cannot be determined while adhering to mandatory principles of fair voting procedures.</p>

<p>For example, the following shows the type of problem typical of an election. Consider the following example, where voters are asked to rank their preference of candidates A, B and C:</p>

<ul>
<li>45 votes A > B > C (45 people prefer A over B and prefer B over C)</li>
<li>40 votes B > C > A (40 people prefer B over C and prefer C over A)</li>
<li>30 votes C > A > B (30 people prefer C over A and prefer A over B)</li>
</ul>

<p>Candidate A has the most votes, so he/she would be the winner. However, if B was not running, C would be the winner, as more people prefer C over A. (A would have 45 votes and C would have 70). This result is a demonstration of Arrow's theorem.</p>
