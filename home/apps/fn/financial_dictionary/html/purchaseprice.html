<h1>Purchase Price</h1>

<p>The price that an investor pays for a security. This price is important as it is the main component in calculating the returns achieved by the investor.</p>

<p>Essentially, it can be thought of as the price that is paid for anything that is bought.</p>

<p>For example, if an investor buys Ford stock at $15, then this would be the purchase price. When looking at the return on the investment, the investor would compare the purchase price of $15 to the price the investment was sold at or the current market price for Ford.</p>

<p>Purchase price can also refer to the price that a company pays for an item, such as another company. For example, if Ford bought Kia for $3.5 billion, this would be Ford's purchase price.</p>
