<h1>Inchoate Interest</h1>

<p>Interests, generally property interests, that are likely to vest but have not yet actually done so. The inchoate interest usually is dependent on an event occurring that triggers the interest, such as a relative's death triggering an inheritance. The interest that the inheriting relative has in the inheritance is inchoate until the death occurs, at which point it becomes a real interest.</p>

<p>Note that inchoate interests are not certain to vest. There is still the possibility of a change in circumstances that would prevent the interests from vesting or occurring.</p>
