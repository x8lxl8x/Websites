<h1>Premium</h1>

<p>1. The total cost of an option.</p>

<p>2. The difference between the higher price paid for a fixed-income security and the security's face amount at issue.</p>

<p>3. The specified amount of payment required periodically by an insurer to provide coverage under a given insurance plan for a defined period of time. The premium is paid by the insured party to the insurer, and primarily compensates the insurer for bearing the risk of a payout should the insurance agreement's coverage be required.</p>

<p>1. The premium of an option is basically the sum of the option's intrinsic and time value. It is important to note that volatility also affects the premium.</p>

<p>2. If a fixed-income security (bond) is purchased at a premium, existing interest rates are lower than the coupon rate. Investors pay a premium for an investment that will return an amount greater than existing interest rates.</p>

<p>3. A common example of an insurance premium comes from auto insurance. A vehicle owner can insure the value of his or her vehicle against loss resulting from accident, theft and other potential problems. The owner usually pays a fixed premium amount in exchange for the insurance company's guarantee to cover any economic losses incurred under the scope of the agreement.</p>
