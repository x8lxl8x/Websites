<h1>Builders Risk Coverage Form</h1>

<p>An insurance policy that covers residential and commercial structures while they are under construction or being remodeled or renovated. Covered building components include foundations, fixtures, machinery, equipment used to service the building, building materials and supplies, and debris removal in the event of a loss.</p>

<p>The policy may not include land, landscaping, satellites or antennas, construction materials in transit, scaffolding, construction trailers, theft of materials from the job site and signs that are not attached to the building. It may be possible to obtain additional coverage for things not included in the standard policy.</p>

<p>The policy must be purchased when the project is less than 30% complete and coverage ends when the owner takes possession, 90 days have passed since the completion of construction, or the insured abandons the project with no plans to complete it.</p>

<p>The named insured will usually be the property's contractor or developer, but in some cases it is the building owner or homeowner. This type of policy often requires builders to have a minimum amount of experience (such as 2-3 years).</p>
