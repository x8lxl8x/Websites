<h1>Wash Trading</h1>

<p>The process of buying shares of a company through one broker while selling shares through a different broker. Wash trading can also make a stock's volume appear to have a lot of activity resulting from the repeated buying and selling done by an individual or firm when, in fact, the shares have never changed owners.</p>

<p>Wash trading is illegal, as it is done in order to manipulate the market and prompt other investors into buying the position. A quick turnaround in positions isn't considered wash trading, as long as the transaction creates market risk for the trader and changes their market position, even if only temporarily.</p>
