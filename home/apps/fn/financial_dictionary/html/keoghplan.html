<h1>Keogh Plan</h1>

<p>A tax deferred pension plan available to self-employed individuals or unincorporated businesses for retirement purposes. A Keogh plan can be set up as either a defined-benefit or defined-contribution plan, although most plans are defined contribution. Contributions are generally tax deductible up to 25% of annual income with a limit of $47,000 (as of 2007). Keogh plan types include money-purchase plans (used by high-income earners), defined-benefit plans (which have high annual minimums) and profit-sharing plans (which offer annual flexibility based on profits).</p>

<p>Also known as an HR(10) plan, Keogh plans can invest in the same set of securities as 401(k)s and IRAs, including stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit and annuities.</p>

<p>Keogh plans were established through legislation by Congress in 1962 and were spearheaded by Eugene Keogh. As with other qualified retirement accounts, funds can be accessed as early as 59.5 and withdrawals must begin by age 70.5.</p>

<p>Keoghs are known to have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans, but the contribution limits are higher, making Keoghs a popular option for many business owners and proprietors.</p>
