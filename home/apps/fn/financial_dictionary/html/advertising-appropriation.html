<h1>Advertising Appropriation</h1>

<p>The portion of the total marketing budget that is allocated to advertising over a specific time period. The advertising appropriation policy for a company may be based on any one of a number of approaches. For example, spending an amount on advertising that is a fixed percentage of sales or based on the ad spend level of the competition.</p>

<p>In practice, the amount of the advertising appropriation is not very easy to establish. This is because of the lack of a definite relationship, in most cases, between the amount of advertising and the company's sales and profitability. Advertising appropriation is also sometimes referred to as advertising budget.</p>
