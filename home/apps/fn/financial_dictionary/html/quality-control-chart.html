<h1>Quality Control Chart</h1>

<p>A graphic that depicts whether sampled products or processes are meeting their intended specifications and, if not, the degree by which they vary from those specifications. Analyzing the pattern of variance depicted by a quality control chart can help determine if defects are occurring randomly or systematically.</p>

<p>Different types of quality control charts, such as X-bar charts, S charts and Np charts are used depending on the type of data that needs to be analyzed. A quality control chart can also be univariate or multivariate, meaning that it can show whether a product or process deviates from one or from more than one desired result.</p>
