<h1>Imbalance of Orders</h1>

<p>A situation when too many orders of a particular type - either buy, sell or limit - for listed securities and not enough of the other, matching orders are received by an exchange. Also referred to as "order imbalance".</p>

<p>Shares experiencing an imbalance of orders may be temporarily halted if trading has already commenced for the day. If it occurs prior to market open, trading may be delayed. Better-than-expected earnings or other unexpected good news can result in a surge in buy orders in relation to sell orders. Likewise, unexpected negative news can bring a large sell-off.</p>
