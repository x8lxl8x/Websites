<h1>Open Offer</h1>

<p>A secondary market offering that is similar to a rights issue in which a shareholder is given the opportunity to purchase stock at a price that is lower than the current market price. The purpose of such an offer is to raise cash for the company.</p>

<p>An open offer differs from a rights issue in that investors are unable to sell the stocks that they purchase under the open offer to other parties. Some investors see a secondary market offering as bad news because it causes stock dilution and may signal that the stock is overvalued.</p>
