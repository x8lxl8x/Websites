<h1>Credit Scoring</h1>

<p>A statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to access a person's credit worthiness. Lenders use credit scoring, among other things, to arrive at a decision on whether to extend credit. A person's credit score is a number between 300 and 850, 850 being the highest credit rating possible.</p>

<p>Fair Isaac Corporation's credit scoring system, known as a FICO score, is the most widely used credit scoring system in the financial industry. Lenders use credit scoring in risk-based pricing in which the terms of a loan, including the interest rate, offered to borrowers are based on the probability of repayment. In general, the better a person's credit score, the better the rate offered to the individual by the financial institution.</p>
