<h1>Dayrate Volatility</h1>

<p>The intraday unpredictability of an exchange rate (or price of a good or service), that changes due to imbalances in supply and demand. Price levels of various goods or services can change very quickly, depending on the current market condition.</p>

<p>Low levels of dayrate volatility illustrate that the market is complacent, and the existing price is not a major concern for the transacting parties. On the other hand, a rise in dayrate volatility can be used to signal fear or a lack of supply. This degree of volatility generally results in large price fluctuations, which suggests that the market is in a state of panic because there may be a larger group of sellers than there are buyers.</p>
