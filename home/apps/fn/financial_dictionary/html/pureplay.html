<h1>Pure Play</h1>

<p>A publicly traded company that is focused on only one industry or product. Pure play companies are popular with certain types of active investors who do a lot of research and want to make very specific bets on particular products or industry segments. For these investors, buying a company with several diversified business lines forces them to take risk in industries that they did not want to be invested in.</p>

<p>For some large companies, the allure of creating a pure play may make it worthwhile to spin off certain business lines or divisions into their own companies. Occasionally, the market will value the two resulting companies at a higher value than they did the original firm. This can be particularly true in hot industries and where there are few pure play companies to invest in that are already in the market.</p>
