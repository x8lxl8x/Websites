<h1>Forex Signal System</h1>

<p>A set of analyses that a forex trader uses to determine whether to buy or sell a currency pair at any given time. Forex signal systems could be based on technical analysis charting tools or news-based events. The day trader's currency trading system is usually made up of a multitude of signals that work together to create a buy or sell decision. Forex trading signals are available for free, for a fee or are developed by the traders themselves.</p>

<p>Forex signal systems can create executions that are either manual or automated. A manual system involves a trader sitting at the computer screen, looking for signals and interpreting whether to buy or sell. An automated trading system involves the trader "teaching" the software what signals to look for and how to interpret them. It is thought that automated trading removes the psychological element that is detrimental to a lot of traders.</p>

<p>Both automated and manual day trading signals are available for purchase on the internet. However, it is important to note that there is no such thing as the "holy grail" of trading signals. If the system was a perfect money maker, the seller would not want to share it. This is why big financial firms keep their "black box" trading programs under lock and key.</p>
