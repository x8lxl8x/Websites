<h1>Revenue</h1>

<p>The amount of money that a company actually receives during a specific period, including discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. It is the "top line" or "gross income" figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income.</p>

<p>Revenue is calculated by multiplying the price at which goods or services are sold by the number of units or amount sold.</p>

<p>Revenue is also known as "REVs."
Revenue is the amount of money that is brought into a company by its business activities. In the case of government, revenue is the money received from taxation, fees, fines, inter-governmental grants or transfers, securities sales, mineral rights and resource rights, as well as any sales that are made.           </p>
