<h1>Guy Dollé</h1>

<p>The former chairman and CEO of steel company Arcelor from 2001 to 2006. The company produced flat carbon steel, long carbon steel and stainless steel and managed steel distribution. In 2006, Mittal Steel took over Arcelor to become Arcelor-Mittal; Dollé's job was a casualty of that transaction. Arcelor experienced large operating losses in 2001, but Dolle led the company to earnings of almost 800 million in 2002 despite a loss of export business due to steel tariffs imposed by the George W. Bush administration. In 2003, he worked on expanding the company's global presence by forming a Global Steel Alliance with automakers in Italy, Spain and Japan.</p>

<p>Dollé was born in 1942 in France and educated at the École Polytechnique. He began his career with Irsid Steel Research Center in 1966, and after working there for about 15 years, he went to Usinor. In 1993 he became chairman and CEO of Unimetal and in 2002 he became chairman and CEO of Arcelor, which formed in 2001 when Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor merged. The new company was listed on stock exchanges a year later.</p>
