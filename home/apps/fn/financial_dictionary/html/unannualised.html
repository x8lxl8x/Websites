<h1>Unannualized</h1>

<p>A rate of return on an investment for a period other than one year. An unannualized return may be used to report results for a month, quarter or for several years. When the returns on a particular investment are converted to reflect the rate on an annual basis, it is referred to as the annualized return.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to compare unannualized rates because of different time periods; therefore, some people annualize the return so that it can be compared to other companies or returns. However, annualized rates are only estimates. For example, if the return for January was 1%, this would be the unannualized return, the annualized return without compounding is 12%.</p>
