<h1>Reciprocal Statutes</h1>

<p>Legislation enacted between two or more states promoting commerce. Reciprocal Statutes can be enacted for a variety of economic reasons, such as to allow uniform regional banking or corporate taxation rules. This legislation is usually intended to streamline trade and business transactions.</p>

<p>Another example of Reciprocal Status could be permitting in-state tuition for students from another state in return for the same treatment for the other state's students. This would allow a greater number of students to consider the other state's educational institution as a possibility. Reciprocal Statutes can be enacted for noneconomic reasons as well.</p>
