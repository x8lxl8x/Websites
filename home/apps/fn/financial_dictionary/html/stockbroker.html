<h1>Stockbroker</h1>

<p>1. An agent that charges a fee or commission for executing buy and sell orders submitted by an investor.</p>

<p>2. The firm that acts as an agent for a customer, charging the customer a commission for its services.</p>

<p>It used to be that only the wealthy could afford a broker and have access to the stock market. With the internet came the explosion of discount brokers that let you trade at a smaller fee, but don't provide personalized advice. Because of discount brokers, nearly anybody can afford to invest in the market now.</p>
