<h1>Covered Warrant</h1>

<p>A type of warrant that allows the holder to buy or sell a specific amount of equities, currency or other financial instruments from the issuer, usually a bank or a similar financial institution, at a specific price and time.</p>

<p>The main differences between normal warrants and covered warrants are:</p>

<p>1. Covered warrants can have a wide variety of underlying financial products. Normal warrants only have a company's stock as their underlying financial product.</p>

<p>2. Covered warrants are only issued by financial institutions. Normal warrants are only issued by the company that issued the underlying equity.</p>

<p>3. Covered warrants can have a variety of exercise prices depending on the conditions set forth by each issue. Normal warrants generally have only one exercise price.</p>

<p>4. Covered warrants allow the warrant holder to buy or sell the underlying asset. Normal warrants allow the warrant holder only to buy the underlying equity.</p>
