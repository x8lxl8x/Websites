<h1>Investment Fund</h1>

<p>A supply of capital belonging to numerous investors that is used to collectively purchase securities while each investor retains ownership and control of his or her own shares. An investment fund provides a broader selection of investment opportunities, greater management expertise and lower investment fees than investors might be able to obtain on their own. Types of investment funds include mutual funds, exchange traded funds, money market funds and hedge funds.</p>

<p>Individual investors do not make decisions about how a fund's assets should be invested. They simply choose which fund to invest in based on its goals, risk, fees and other factors. A fund manager actually oversees the fund and decides which securities it should hold, in what quantities and when they should be bought and sold. An investment fund can be broad-based, such as an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, or it can be tightly focused, such as an ETF that invests only in small technology stocks.</p>
