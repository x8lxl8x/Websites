<h1>SEC Form 424B4</h1>

<p>The prospectus form that a company must file to disclose information referred to in forms 424B1 and 424B3. Companies are required to file prospectus form 424B4 in accordance with Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.</p>

<p>The Securities Exchange Act of 1933 was created to help investors make informed decisions by requiring securities issuers to complete and file registration statements (including financial and material information) with the SEC before making an issue available for purchase by the public.  Often registration statements filings required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 are also registration statements under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</p>
