<h1>Mill Rate</h1>

<p>The amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property. The mill rate is based on "mills"; as each mill is one-thousandth of a currency unit, one mill is equivalent to one-tenth of a cent or $0.001. Property tax in dollar terms is calculated by multiplying the assessed property value and the mill rate and dividing by 1,000. As a property may be subject to tax by a number of different authorities, mill rates are set by each taxing authority so as to meet the revenue projections in their budgets.</p>

<p>For a given jurisdiction, mill rates may depend on the classification of property, whether it is residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and so on.</p>

<p>As an example of using the mill rate to calculate the dollar amount of property tax payable, consider a property with an assessed value of $300,000 that is located in a jurisdiction with a mill rate of 15. The property tax levied would therefore be $4,500.</p>
