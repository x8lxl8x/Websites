<h1>Trailing Price-To-Earnings - Trailing P/E</h1>

<p>The sum of a company's price-to-earnings, calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share for the past 12 months. This measure differs from forward P/E, which uses earnings <i>estimates</i> for the next four quarters.</p>

<p>The trailing P/E ratio is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>This is the most commonly used P/E measure because it is based on actual earnings and, therefore, is the most accurate. However, stock prices are constantly moving while earnings remain fixed. As a result, forward P/E can sometimes be more relevant to investors when evaluating a company.</p>
