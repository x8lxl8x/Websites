<h1>Home Modification</h1>

<p>Alterations made to a home to meet the needs of people with physical limitations so they can live independently (to some degree) and safely. Examples of home modifications include removing throw rugs to prevent slips and falls, installing grab bars in the bathroom for stability and so on.</p>

<p>Many minor home modifications and repairs can be done with as little as a few hundred dollars to as much as a few thousand. For larger projects, some financing options may be available and some contractors even offer reduced rates and charge sliding-scale fees based on a seniors' income and ability to pay. The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modifications is one of the best resources in the U.S., offering training and education courses and technical assistance.</p>
