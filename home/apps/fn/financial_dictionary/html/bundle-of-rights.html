<h1>Bundle Of Rights</h1>

<p>A set of legal rights afforded to the real estate title holder. The bundle of rights can include the right of possession (the property is owned by the title holder), the right of control (the owner controls the property's use), the right of exclusion (the holder can deny people access to the property), the right of enjoyment (the holder can use the property in any legal manner) and the right of disposition (the holder can buy or sell the property).</p>

<p>Real estate ownership carries with it a complex set of rights, and the bundle of rights concept has traditionally been the way in which those rights are assigned. When someone purchases a piece of property, he or she isn't necessarily afforded all of the rights. The rights can be broken up and given to different parties.</p>
