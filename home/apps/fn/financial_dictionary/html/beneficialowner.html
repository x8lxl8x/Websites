<h1>Beneficial Owner</h1>

<p>1. A person who enjoys the benefits of ownership even though title is in another name.</p>

<p>2. Any individual or group of individuals that, either directly or indirectly, has the power to vote or influence the transaction decisions regarding a specific security.</p>

<p>1. For example, when shares of a mutual fund are held by a custodian bank or when securities are held by a broker in street name, the true owner is the beneficial owner, even though, for safety and convenience, the bank or broker holds title.</p>

<p>2. Beneficial ownership may be shared among a group of individuals. If a beneficial owner controls a position of more than 5% it must file Schedule 13D under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
