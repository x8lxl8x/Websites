<h1>Flip</h1>

<p>A point when traders shift from having more long positions to having more short positions, or vice versa. A flip can be described as a situation when a trader decides that their outlook or strategy is no longer a winning one, and begins to take steps to reverse their positions. This may involve selling long equity positions in favor of short positions, or through the use of derivative instruments.</p>

<p>This can be a very effective tool for determining the trend of a certain currency. A shift from long to short positions indicates that the market's bullish outlook on a specific currency could be coming to an end. Another such example could be the market for crude oil, which has been known to be a very volatile trade, with traders often "flipping" positions numerous times over the course of a contract.</p>
