<h1>Seller's Option</h1>

<p>The right of a forward contract seller to choose some of the specifications of a commodity to be delivered. The choices about the delivered commodity's quality and delivery specifications must fit among the limits imposed by the terms of the contract.</p>

<p>Seller's option can also refer to a put option.</p>

<p>For some commodities, such as rice and oil, collecting suitable amounts of a commodity and providing the transportation can be a very complicated process. For example, a contract for corn can represent 5,000 bushels. Since hedgers tend to buy large numbers of contracts at a given time, a forward contract seller might have to deliver hundreds of thousands of corn bushels during one delivery. Giving contract sellers a little bit of leeway can alleviate some of the difficulties involved with delivery logistics.</p>
