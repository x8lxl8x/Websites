<h1>Return On Debt - ROD</h1>

<p>1. A measure of a company's performance or net income as related to the amount of debt it has issued.</p>

<p>2. The amount of profit generated for each dollar that a company holds in debt.</p>

<p>3. A necessary factor when using the adjusted present value (APV) discounted cash flow method for valuing levered assets. The APV method is often used in a leveraged buyout as a way of valuing a firm that has a changing capital structure.</p>

<p>Return on debt (ROD) is a complex financial modeling skill and not a commonly used financial reporting factor.</p>

<p>Companies that carry significant amounts of debt relative to capital and/or assets are more at risk during an economic downturn when earnings are likely to decline and credit measures may be tightened.</p>
