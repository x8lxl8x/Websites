<h1>Sushi Roll</h1>

<p>A candlestick pattern consisting of 10 bars where the first five (inside bars) are confined within a narrow range of highs and lows and the second five (outside bars) engulf the first with both a higher high and lower low. If a sushi roll appears in a prevailing trend, it is a sign that there may be an upcoming trend reversal.</p>

<p>Sushi roll analysis is used to try to predict market tops and bottoms.
The pattern is similar to a bearish or bullish engulfing pattern, except that it is composed of multiple bars instead of a pattern of two single bars. This pattern was named a sushi roll by Mark Fisher in his book, "The Logical Trader".            </p>
