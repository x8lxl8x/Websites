<h1>Lifelong Learning Plan</h1>

<p>A provision applicable to the Canadian Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). The plan allows RRSP contributors a non-taxable temporary withdrawal of up to $20,000 from their accounts in order to finance their education or that of their spouse. The provision is subject to limitations, such as a $10,000 annual withdrawal limit and a maximum repayment period of 10 years, after which the ability to recontribute the borrowed sum is lost.</p>

<p>Similar to the Canadian government's Home Buyer's Plan, this provision is intended to allow Canadians to finance their education without losing the benefits of tax-deferral in building their retirement nest egg.</p>
