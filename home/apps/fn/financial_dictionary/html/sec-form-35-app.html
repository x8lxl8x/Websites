<h1>SEC Form 35-APP</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be submitted by public utility holding companies wanting to engage in a transaction for which no other form of application was prescribed. SEC Form 35-APP provided investors and the SEC with detailed information about the proposed transaction as part of the SEC's efforts to regulate public utility holding companies.</p>

<p>SEC Form 35-APP, "statement concerning a proposed transaction", was required under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), which regulated the holding companies of electric and natural gas utilities and which was repealed on August 8, 2005. Since the act was repealed, this form is now obsolete.</p>
