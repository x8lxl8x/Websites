<h1>Primary Exchange</h1>

<p>The most important stock exchange in a given country. Common characteristics of a primary exchange include a long history, primary listings of the country's top companies, listings of many important foreign corporations, large total market capitalization and a large trade value. A country may have other important stock exchanges in addition to its primary exchange.</p>

<p>For example, the United Kingdom's primary exchange is the London Stock Exchange. It was founded in 1801 and has a daily volume of approximately $2 trillion. The NYSE is, of course, the primary exchange of the United States. Other primary exchanges include the following:
Canada - Toronto Stock Exchange
Japan - Tokyo Stock Exchange
China - Shanghai Stock Exchange
India - Bombay Stock Exchange</p>
