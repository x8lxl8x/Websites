<h1>Client Centric</h1>

<p>A specific approach to doing business that focuses on the customer. Client centric businesses ensure that the customer is at the center of a business's philosophy, operations or ideas. These businesses believe that their clients are the only reason that they exist and use every means at their disposal to keep the client happy and satisfied.</p>

<p>Client centric has long been a buzzword in service-oriented industries such as the financial services. Firms that strive to be Client Centric often do so by offering one-stop shopping for middle-income customers. Others may provide a suite of high-level services for high-net worth clients.</p>
