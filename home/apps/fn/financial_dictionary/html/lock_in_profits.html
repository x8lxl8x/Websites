<h1>Lock In Profits</h1>

<p>Realizing the gains of a position, such as buying a stock, by exiting at a profit. By locking in, that portion of the investment is no longer exposed to risks. All profits are unrealized until the position is closed.</p>

<p>Also known as "realization."</p>

<p>When investing it is important to protect your capital and your profits, this can be done by locking in your profits.</p>

<p>For example, if you bought 100 shares of ABC Company for $12 and the price went up to $36 two days later all potential profits are unrealized because the position isn't partially or fully closed. You can lock in the profits by selling 50 shares because 50 x $36 = $1,800. If the stock drops to $1, you will have still made a profit.</p>
