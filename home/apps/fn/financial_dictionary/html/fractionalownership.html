<h1>Fractional Ownership</h1>

<p>Percentage ownership in an asset. Fractional ownership shares in the asset are sold to individual shareholders who share the benefits of the asset such as usage rights, income sharing, priority access and/or reduced rates. The usage benefits that the fractional owners receive are similar to those of timeshare owners.</p>

<p>Fractional ownership is a common investment structure for expensive assets such as aircraft, sports cars and vacation properties. The fundamental difference between fractional ownership and timeshare is that, with fractional ownership, the investor owns part of the title, rather than units of time; with fractional ownership, if the asset increases in value, so does the value of the shares in the investment.</p>
