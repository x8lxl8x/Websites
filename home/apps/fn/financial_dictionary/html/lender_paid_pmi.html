<h1>Lender-Paid Private Mortgage Insurance</h1>

<p>Private mortgage insurance that a mortgage lender pays on behalf of a borrower. Mortgage lenders generally require private mortgage insurance if a mortgage has a loan to value (LTV) ratio of more than 80%. When a lender pays the private mortgage insurance on behalf of the borrower, they do so in exchange for charging the borrower a higher interest rate. In other words, the borrower still pays for the private mortgage insurance, but does so in the form of a higher interest rate.</p>

<p>The economics of the choice between paying private mortgage insurance, choosing lender paid private mortgage insurance, or using a second mortgage to avoid private mortgage insurance altogether is a function of how long borrowers estimates they will remain in a home or how long before they might refinance their mortgages and how quickly they estimate their home will appreciate.</p>
