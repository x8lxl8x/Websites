<h1>Member Of Household Test</h1>

<p>A test that can be administered to a prospective dependent in lieu of the "relationship test". If a person does not meet the criteria to be considered a close relative by the IRS, he or she may still qualify as a member of household if he or she lived as a member of the taxpayer's household for the entire year. Domestic employees, such as maids and babysitters, are excluded from this treatment.</p>

<p>Both the taxpayer and the prospective dependent can be temporarily absent from the home during the year without jeopardizing the dependency status. This type of absence can be for illness, vacation, education, business, military service or other similar reasons. If a person is born or dies during the year but lived as a member of the household the rest of the year, that person still qualifies as a member of the household.</p>
