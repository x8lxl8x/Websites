<h1>Corner</h1>

<p>1. The act of securing enough controlling interest or ownership within a single security so that manipulation of price can occur.</p>

<p>2. A rare situation occurring in commodity markets wherein the quantity of underlying securities and commodities available are exceeded by the commitments of delivery quantities on future contracts.</p>

<p>1. When someone is said to have "cornered the market," he or she has gained significant power over the manipulation of quantity and price.</p>

<p>2. In other words, the obligations on future contracts to deliver a particular commodity greatly outweigh the actual amount of the commodity available. For example, a freak tornado sweeping through Hawaii and killing all pineapple crops would result in a corner. The tornado would drastically reduce the quantity of pineapples available for delivery against the delivery obligations of future contracts that were previously created.</p>
