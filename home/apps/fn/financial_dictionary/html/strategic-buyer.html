<h1>Strategic Buyer</h1>

<p>A type of buyer in an acquisition that has a specific reason for wanting to purchase the company. Strategic buyers look for companies that will create a synergy with their existing businesses.</p>

<p>Because strategic buyers may actually get more value out of an acquisition than the intrinsic value of the company being acquired, strategic buyers will usually be willing to pay a premium price in order to have the deal go through.</p>

<p>Also known as synergistic buyers.</p>

<p>Strategic buyers can come in many forms. A strategic buyer could be a competitor or a company in the same industry that wants to move into a new region. Purchasing an existing company in a new region may be more cost effective than starting new operations themselves.</p>

<p>Another possibility could be a company in an unrelated business, seeing that the company being acquired has strengths that could help their existing business. An example of this is a food manufacturer acquiring a supply-chain management/logistics firm.</p>
