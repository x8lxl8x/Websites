<h1>Appraised Value</h1>

<p>An evaluation of a property's value based on a given point in time that is performed by a professional appraiser during the mortgage origination process. The appraiser is usually chosen by the lender, but the appraisal is paid for by the borrower.</p>

<p>The appraised value of a home is an important factor in the loan underwriting process and plays a role in determining how much money may be borrowed and under what terms. For example, the loan to value (LTV) ratio is based on the appraised value.</p>

<p>In general, if the LTV is greater than 80%, the lender will require the borrower to buy private mortgage insurance. However, if the LTV drops to 78% upon a new appraisal, private mortgage insurance payments may be eliminated.</p>
