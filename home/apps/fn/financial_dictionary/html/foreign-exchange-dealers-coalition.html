<h1>Foreign Exchange Dealers Coalition - FXDC</h1>

<p>An alliance of the largest U.S. foreign exchange dealers formed in 2007. The Foreign Exchange Dealers Coalition's goal is to create awareness and recognition of forex dealers and their views regarding regulation implementation in the forex industry. Foreign exchange dealers that are part of the coalition attempt to use their collective power to influence the industry.</p>

<p>The FXDC has become involved with forex industry proposals that address major regulatory changes. For example, the FXDC became involved in 2007, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) required mandatory registration through the National Futures Association (NFA) for retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs), futures commission merchants (FCMs), forex commodity pool operators (CPOs) and commodity trade advisors (CTAs).</p>
