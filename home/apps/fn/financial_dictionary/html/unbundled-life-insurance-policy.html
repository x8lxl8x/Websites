<h1>Unbundled Life Insurance Policy</h1>

<p>A type of financial protection plan that provides cash to beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. A unbundled life insurance policy contains a savings and investment component that the policyholder can use during his or her lifetime or pass on to beneficiaries. This does not expire when the policyholder reaches a certain age; and that allows the policyholder to adjust the amount and timing of premium payments and the amount of the death benefit while the policy is in force.</p>

<p>Unbundled life insurance is another word for universal life insurance.</p>

<p>Both whole and universal/unbundled life insurance are types of permanent life insurance and have a cash value component in which a portion of each premium payment is saved and invested on the policyholder's behalf. The other portion of the premium goes toward administrative expenses and the death benefit.</p>

<p>However, there is an important difference between these two types of policies. With whole life insurance, the premiums and death benefit are fixed when the policy is purchased. With universal/unbundled life insurance, the premiums and death benefit can be changed during the life of the policy. This can be a desirable feature if the policyholder's needs change.</p>

<p>The universal/unbundled policy also clearly discloses the policy's administrative fees - also called underwriting and sales expense charges - to the policyholder, whereas a whole life policy does not. Thus, in addition to providing flexibility, universal/unbundled life insurance allows the policyholder to see exactly where his or her premium payments are going.</p>
