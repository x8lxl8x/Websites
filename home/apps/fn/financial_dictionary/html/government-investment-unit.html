<h1>Government Investment Unit - Indonesia</h1>

<p>A sovereign wealth fund established in Indonesia and managed by the Ministry of Finance. The fund seeks to create macroeconomic stability and help promote economic growth by investing in a wide array of investment types, including equity, debt and by directly investing in the economies of foreign countries.</p>

<p>The Government Investment Unit was established in 2006. Unlike the sovereign wealth funds of many other countries it is not dependent on commodities as a funding source. The fund is not independent and works closely with the Indonesian government, creating separate funds to handle infrastructure and environmentally-related projects.</p>
