<h1>Broker Of Record</h1>

<p>In insurance, a broker of record is an agent designated by the policy holder to represent and manage the policyholder's insurance policy. The broker of record may receive copies of all communications to the policy holder and may receive all quotes, policies and notices on behalf of the policy holder. They may also obtain and evaluate insurance quotes and policies and recommend changes to existing policies.</p>

<p>A broker of record can serve an individual or may assist a company, for example with handling the health insurance policies of its employees. In return, the broker of record may earn a monthly commission from the health insurance company. A broker of record letter is used to legally establish the relationship between the broker, policyholder and insurance company. Such a letter can be used to designate a broker of record for the first time or to replace an existing broker of record with a new one.</p>
