<h1>Cooling-Off Rule</h1>

<p>A term referring to law pertaining to newly-entered contracts that allows both sides of the party a period of time (after the contract has been signed) to release themselves from any obligations without penalty.</p>

<p>Different types of transactions will have different cooling-off rules, and not all types of contracts have such provisions. Typically this period will be three days; however, it is imperative that all the rules and regulations listed in the fine print are read before entry into a contract.</p>

<p>In the U.S., federal law usually requires a three-day penalty-free period for the rescission/withdrawal from any refinancing contract associated with the primary residence.</p>
