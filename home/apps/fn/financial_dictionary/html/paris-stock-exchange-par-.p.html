<h1>Paris Stock Exchange (PAR) .PA</h1>

<p>Now known as the NYSE Euronext (NYX), the Paris Stock Exchange trades both equities and derivatives and posts the CAC 40 Index. This index is made up of French companies, although nearly half of these are owned by foreign entities. NYX seeks to offer the most modern and advanced trading platform and services available to traders.</p>

<p>The NYX is the first European integrated stock exchange. It was created in 2000 when the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges all merged. It employs the NSC system for trading and uses LCH Clearnet to clear its transactions.</p>
