<h1>Home Equity Line Of Credit - HELOC</h1>

<p>A line of credit extended to a homeowner that uses the borrower's home as collateral. Once a maximum loan balance is established, the homeowner may draw on the line of credit at his or her discretion. Interest is charged on a predetermined variable rate, which is usually based on prevailing prime rates.</p>

<p>Once there is a balance owing on the loan, the homeowner can choose the repayment schedule as long as minimum interest payments are made monthly. The term of a HELOC can last anywhere from less than five to more than 20 years, at the end of which all balances must be paid in full.</p>

<p>Several factors can lead to strong growth rates in this type of borrowing:</p>

<p>-Increased retail sales channels, which have brought HELOCs to the masses. Most of these sales channels come from local banking institutions.
-Rising home values, which increase the amount of equity available to homeowners
-Prevailing low interest rates coupled with moderate inflation
-The fact that mortgage interest is often tax-deductible, making it more attractive than alternative borrowing methods</p>

<p>Because HELOC interest is variable, homeowners must be aware of prevailing interest rates -a spike can cause repayment balances to rise rapidly.</p>
