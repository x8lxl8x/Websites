<h1>Unscheduled Recast</h1>

<p>The unscheduled recalculation of the remaining amortization schedule of a loan. The recalculation occurs when certain triggers contained in the contractual terms of the loan are reached. This might lead to a substantial increase in the loan's scheduled periodic payments.</p>

<p>Payment option ARMs typically have contractual triggers, which cause an unscheduled recast of the mortgage. These triggers are in the form of a negative amortization limit. Negative amortization on such mortgages is limited to between 110-125% of the loan's original principal balance. For example, if the mortgage's principal balance reaches 110% of the original principal balance due to negative amortization, the loan will recast. This presents a great deal of payment shock risk to the borrower.</p>
