<h1>Axe</h1>

<p>The interest that a person or trader shows in buying or selling a financial security. There are many reasons why someone would have a particular interest in a security. If a trader holds a long position but has short-term concerns, that trader's "axe" toward short-term put options may be significant. Also used as a colloquial expression to indicate job cuts or layoffs.</p>

<p>The term "axe" may be derived from the phrase "axe to grind," which means to possess an ulterior motive or selfish aim. For example, consider a situation where trader A has a large position in a stock, and other market participants have no knowledge of this trader's position. If trader A shops around for quotes with the intention of unloading part, or all, of his or her long position, trader B, who makes a price quote to trader A, would be at a disadvantage if he or she is unaware that trader A has an axe with regard to this specific stock.</p>
