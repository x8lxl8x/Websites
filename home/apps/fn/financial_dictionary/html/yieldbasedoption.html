<h1>Yield-Based Option</h1>

<p>A type of debt-instrument-based option that derives its value from the difference between the exercise price and the value of the yield of the underlying debt instrument. Yield-based options are settled in cash. A yield-based call buyer expects interest rates to go up, while a yield-based put buyer expects interest rates to go down.</p>

<p>If the interest rate of the underlying debt security rises above the strike price of a yield-based call option plus the premium paid, the call holder is 'in the money'. Should the opposite occur, and the interest rate falls below the strike price less the premium paid for a yield-based put option, the put holder is in the money.</p>
