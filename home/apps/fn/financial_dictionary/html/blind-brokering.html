<h1>Blind Brokering</h1>

<p>When brokerage firms ensure anonymity to both the buyer and the seller in a transaction. In the ordinary course of securities trading, most brokerage transactions are "blind". Exceptions occur for broker/dealers or others acting as both broker and principal on a given trade</p>

<p>Disclosure to either the buying or selling party of the identity of the other is not the norm in public securities trading, except in some cases of privately arranged transactions.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is when the broker is a principal and selling securities from its own inventory to a customer of the firm. In this case, disclosure is required due to a possible conflict of interest.</p>
