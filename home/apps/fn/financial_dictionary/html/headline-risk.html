<h1>Headline Risk</h1>

<p>The possibility that a news story will adversely affect a stock's price. Headline risk can also impact the performance of the stock market as a whole.</p>

<p>For example, in the aftermath of the housing crisis, mortgage lenders such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and CitiGroup faced significant headline risk.</p>

<p>One way a company can mitigate headline risk is through effective public relations campaigns. Successful public relations efforts can promote positive images of a company that can help counteract any negative stories as well as provide swift damage control if such a story is released. Individual investors can counteract headline risk by using a buy-and-hold investing strategy that ignores the short-term changes in the market that are triggered by headlines.</p>
