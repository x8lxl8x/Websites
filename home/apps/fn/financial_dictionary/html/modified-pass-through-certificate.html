<h1>Modified Pass-Through Certificate</h1>

<p>A fixed-income security that passes through an undivided interest in a pool of mortgages. Modified pass-through certificates are backed by federal loans of identical maturity and coupon date. Principal and interest payments are made to investors each month, and these payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).</p>

<p>Categorically, these certificates are a type of pass-through certificate. When a mortgage banker has accumulated at least $2 million of mortgages, a certificate is issued for them after the banker deposits the loans. These certificates differ from CMOs and mortgage backed bonds in that they do not hold back interest payments.</p>
