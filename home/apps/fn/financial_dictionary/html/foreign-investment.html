<h1>Foreign Investment</h1>

<p>Flows of capital from one nation to another in exchange for significant ownership stakes in domestic companies or other domestic assets. Typically, foreign investment denotes that foreigners take a somewhat active role in management as a part of their investment. Foreign investment typically works both ways, especially between countries of relatively equal economic stature.</p>

<p>Currently there is a trend toward globalization whereby large, multinational firms often have investments in a great variety of countries. Many see foreign investment in a country as a positive sign and as a source for future economic growth. The U.S. Commerce Department encourages foreign investment through its "Invest in America" initiative.</p>
