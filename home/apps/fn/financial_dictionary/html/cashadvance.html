<h1>Cash Advance</h1>

<p>A service provided by many credit card issuers allowing cardholders to withdraw a certain amount of cash, either through an ATM or directly from a bank or other financial agency. Cash advances typically carry a high interest rate - even higher than credit card itself - and the interest begins to accrue immediately. On the plus side, cash advances are quick and easy to obtain in a pinch.</p>

<p>Sometimes businesses with less-than-perfect credit use cash advances to finance their activities. In some instances these advances are even paid for with future credit card receipts. The amount of the cash advance depends on the credit score of a business and its credit card sales. In almost all cases, cash advances should be viewed as a method of last resort.</p>
