<h1>Gold Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests primarily in gold-producing companies or gold bullion. The price of shares within a gold fund should correlate very closely to the spot price of gold itself, assuming the fund holds the majority of its assets in bullion or in the stocks and bonds of gold miners and manufacturers.</p>

<p>While many mutual funds focus on manufacturing and production stocks within precious metals, a few new ETF entries have focused primarily on ownership of gold bullion. Gold funds are a valuable tool for investors, including speculators (gold can be a very volatile commodity) and those wishing to hedge against geopolitical instability. Gold is also valuable as a bet against a falling currency. By investing in a gold fund, a retail or institutional investor can gain exposure to this asset without the hassle of taking delivery of physical gold assets, which is often required in the commodities market.</p>
