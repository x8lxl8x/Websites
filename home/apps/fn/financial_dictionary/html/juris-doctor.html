<h1>Juris Doctor - JD</h1>

<p>A law degree in the United States that was originally designed as a replacement to the Bachelor of Laws degree. A Juris Doctor or Juris Doctorate (JD) represents professional recognition that the holder has a doctoral degree in law. Due to the length of study that most lawyers in the U.S. have to take to attain a law degree, the name change reflected its status as a professional degree.</p>

<p>The Juris Doctor is sometimes a prerequisite for other financial programs and designations. In addition, some schools offer a Juris Doctor and MBA joint degree to permit students to complete both degrees in less time than taking each degree separately.</p>
