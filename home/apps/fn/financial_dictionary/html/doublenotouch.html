<h1>Double No-Touch Option</h1>

<p>A type of exotic option that gives an investor an agreed upon payout if the price of the underlying asset does <i>not</i> reach or surpass one of two predetermined barrier levels. An investor using this type of option pays a premium to his or her broker and in turn receives the right to choose the position of the barriers, the time to expiration, and the payout to be received if the price fails to breach either barrier. With this type of option, the maximum possible loss is just the cost of setting up the option.</p>

<p>A double no-touch option is the opposite of a double one-touch option.</p>

<p>This type of option is useful for a trader who believes that the price of an underlying asset will remain range-bound over a certain period of time. Double no-touch options are growing in popularity among traders in the forex markets.</p>

<p>For example, assume that the current USD/EUR rate is 1.20 and the trader believes that this rate will not change dramatically over the next 14 days. The trader could use a double no-touch option with barriers at 1.19 and 1.21 to capitalize on this outlook. In this case, the trader stands to make a profit if the rate fails to move beyond either of the two barriers.</p>
