<h1>Global Financial Stability Report - GFSR </h1>

<p>A semiannual report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that assesses the stability of global financial markets and emerging market financing. The Global Financial Stability Report focuses on current conditions, especially financial and structural imbalances, that could risk an upset in global financial stability and access to financing by emerging market countries. It emphasizes the ramifications of financial and economic imbalances that are highlighted in one of the IMF's other publications, the World Economic Outlook.</p>

<p>The Global Financial Stability Report replaced two previous reports by the IMF, the annual International Capital Markets Report and the quarterly Emerging Market Financing Report. The purpose of the replacement was to provide a more frequent assessment of the worldwide financial markets and to focus on emerging market financing in a global context.</p>
