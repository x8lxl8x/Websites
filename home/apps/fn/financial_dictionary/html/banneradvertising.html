<h1>Banner Advertising</h1>

<p>A rectangular graphic display that stretches across the top or bottom of a website or down the right or left sidebar. The former type of banner advertisement is called a leaderboard, while the latter is called a skyscraper. Banner ads are image-based rather than text-based and are a popular form of website advertising. The purpose of banner advertising is to promote a brand and/or to get visitors from the host website to go to the advertiser's website.</p>

<p>The host is paid for the banner advertisement through one of three methods: cost per impression (payment for every website visitor who sees the ad), cost per click (payment for every website visitor who clicks on the ad and visits the advertiser's website) or cost per action (payment for every website visitor who clicks on the ad, goes to the advertiser's website and completes a task such as filling out a form or making a purchase).</p>
