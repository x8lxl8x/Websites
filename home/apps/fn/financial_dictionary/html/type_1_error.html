<h1>Type I Error</h1>

<p>A type of error that occurs when a null hypothesis is rejected although it is true. The error accepts the alternative hypothesis, despite it being attributed to chance.</p>

<p>Also referred to as a "false positive".</p>

<p>Type I error rejects an idea that should have been accepted. It also claims that two observances are different, when they are actually the same.</p>

<p>For example, let's look at the trail of an accused criminal. The null hypothesis is that the person is innocent, while the alternative is guilty. A Type I error in this case would mean that the person is found guilty and is sent to jail, despite actually being innocent.</p>
