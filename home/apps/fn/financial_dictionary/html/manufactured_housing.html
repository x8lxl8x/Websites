<h1>Manufactured Housing - MH</h1>

<p>A housing unit constructed primarily off-site prior to being moved to a piece of property where it is set. The cost of construction per square foot is usually considerably less for manufactured housing than for traditional on-site homes (stick-built homes). In the 1990s, this style of housing accounted for nearly 25% of new home sales for families in the United States.</p>

<p>This type of housing also includes "modular homes" - homes divided into multiple sections that are constructed off-site, then assembled like building blocks at the property.</p>

<p>Financing a manufactured home can be different than financing a stick-built home. If the manufactured home is purchased separately from the land on which it will sit, a personal property loan is the most common type of financing. Personal property loans carry a higher interest rate than traditional mortgages. If the manufactured home and the land are purchased together, a traditional mortgage might be available. Loan terms and programs vary from lender to lender. The Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs have manufactured-housing loan programs.</p>
