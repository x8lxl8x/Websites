<h1>Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) Trust</h1>

<p>A type of trust that enables the grantor to provide for a surviving spouse and also to maintain control of how the trust's assets are distributed once the surviving spouse has also died. Income, and sometimes principal, generated from the trust is given to the surviving spouse to ensure that he or she is taken care of for the rest of his or her life.</p>

<p>This type of trust is commonly used by individuals who have children from another marriage. QTIPs enable the grantor to look after his or her current spouse and ensure that the assets from the trust are then passed on to beneficiaries of his or her choice, such as the children from the grantor's first marriage.</p>
