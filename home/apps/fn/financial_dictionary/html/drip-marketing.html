<h1>Drip Marketing</h1>

<p>A strategy employed by many direct marketers where a constant flow of marketing material is sent to customers over a period of time. Drip marketing endeavors to create sales through long-term repeat exposure to its recipients of the goods and services that are advertised.</p>

<p>Drip marketing used to be done chiefly with paper mail and flyers. The internet is now also commonly used as well. Many forms of drip marketing rely on the "Law of 29", which states that most prospects will not buy something until they see an ad for it at least 29 times.</p>
