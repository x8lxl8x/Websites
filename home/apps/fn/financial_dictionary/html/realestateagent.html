<h1>Real Estate Agent</h1>

<p>A person with a state/provincial license to represent a buyer or a seller in a real estate transaction in exchange for commission. Most agents work for a real estate broker or realtor.</p>

<p>Real estate agents are the people you deal with face to face when buying or selling property. These are the people on the front lines of the real estate market and perform such tasks (amongst others) as showing homes to perspective buyers and negotiating transactions on behalf of their client. Real estate agents often work on a 100% commission basis, their income dependent upon their ability to find property suitable for their clients and closing transactions.</p>
