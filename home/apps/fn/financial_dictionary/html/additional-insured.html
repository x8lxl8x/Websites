<h1>Additional Insured</h1>

<p>A type of status associated with  general liability insurance policies that provides coverage to other individuals/groups that were not initially named. After endorsement, the additional insured will then be protected under the named insurer's policy and can file a claim in the event that they are sued.</p>

<p>For example, a business may ask a contractor to add them as an additional insured in their general liability policy. This is to protect the business in the event of any legal claims arise as a direct result of the contractor's work/presense.</p>
