<h1>Networking</h1>

<p>A process that fosters the exchange of information and ideas among individuals or groups that share a common interest. Networking may fall into one of two categories - social or business. In the latter category, one of the implicit objectives is to form professional relationships that may boost one's future business and employment prospects.</p>

<p>Less commonly in finance, the term "networking" may also refer to the setting up and operation of a computer network.</p>

<p>Networking events are common practice within professional organizations, which may also link up with other bodies to stage a joint event. Business networking has received a tremendous boost in participation thanks to the burgeoning popularity of business networking sites such as LinkedIn.</p>
