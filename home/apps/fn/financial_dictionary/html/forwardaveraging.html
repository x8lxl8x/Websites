<h1>Forward Averaging</h1>

<p>Treating lump-sum retirement-plan distributions as if they occurred over a five- or ten-year period. Forward averaging is available only to qualified plan participants who were born before 1936 and meet certain requirements.
This treatment results in the distributions being taxed at a lower rate than the individual's ordinary tax rate.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the capital gains and forward averaging treatment, qualified plan distributions must be in the form of a lump-sum distribution.</p>

<p>Note: The five-year income averaging is repealed for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2000.           </p>
