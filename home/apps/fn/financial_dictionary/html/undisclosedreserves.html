<h1>Undisclosed Reserves</h1>

<p>The unpublished or hidden reserves of a financial institution that may not appear on publicly available documents such as a balance sheet, but are nonetheless real assets, which are accepted as such by most banking institutions.</p>

<p>Undisclosed Reserves are generally described as such only in the banking industry as it applies to capital requirements and are designated as Tier 2 capital along with revaluation reserves and general provisions. Tier 1 or, core, capital is mainly composed of stockholders' equity in the company.</p>
