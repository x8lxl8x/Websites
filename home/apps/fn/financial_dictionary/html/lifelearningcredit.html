<h1>Lifetime Learning Credit</h1>

<p>A provision of the U.S. federal income tax code that lets parents and students lower their tax liability by up to $2,000 to help offset higher education expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit matches dollar for dollar, up to the $2,000 limit, the amount that the parent or student spends on qualified education expenses for a student enrolled at an eligible post-secondary educational institution. This credit may be claimed year after year, but it cannot be combined with the Hope Credit or American Opportunity Credit in the same tax year.</p>

<p>The U.S. government subsidizes individuals' higher education expenses through a number of tax credits, tax deductions and tax-advantaged savings plans. Each of these programs lowers income tax liability for students or their parents. The subsidies include the Lifetime Learning, Hope and American Opportunity credits; tuition and fees, work-related education and student loan interest deductions; and Coverdell education savings accounts and 529 savings plans.</p>
