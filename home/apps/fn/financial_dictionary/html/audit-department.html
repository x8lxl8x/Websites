The audit department conducts periodic audits, typically with a much greater emphasis on detail than that of a company's independent public accountants.</p>

<p>The audit department is usually charged with creating and implementing procedures, controls and oversight for all business areas that have input into the financial books and records of a company. It also usually has responsibility for correcting any deficiencies noted by the independent accountants.</p>
