<h1>Fund Of Funds</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that invests in other mutual funds.</p>

<p>This method is sometimes known as "multi-management".</p>

<p>A fund of funds allows investors to achieve a broad diversification and an appropriate asset allocation with investments in a variety of fund categories that are all wrapped up into one fund. However, if the fund of funds carries an operating expense, investors are essentially paying double for an expense that is already included in the expense figures of the underlying funds.</p>

<p>Historically, a fund of funds showed an expense figure that didn't always include the fees of the underlying funds. As of January 2007, the SEC began requiring that these fees be disclosed in a line called "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" (AFFE).</p>
