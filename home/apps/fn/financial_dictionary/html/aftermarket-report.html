<h1>Aftermarket Report</h1>

<p>A summary of how shares of an initial public offering (IPO) performed after being introduced on the secondary market. At minimum, an aftermarket report will provide the company's name, its ticker symbol, the offer date, offer price and closing price. Investors can then see whether the new stock increased or decreased in price on the secondary market compared to what investors paid on the primary market. An aftermarket report might also include a company description, basic financial data, basic financial ratios and links to recent news articles about the company.</p>

<p>In an IPO, shares are first sold on the primary market. A third party called an underwriter transacts sales of shares between the company that is going public and investors. Those investors can then turn around and sell their shares to other investors in the secondary market. Investors trade shares on the secondary market through the exchange the stock is listed on, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The aftermarket report would then provide data on how the stock traded on the NYSE.</p>
