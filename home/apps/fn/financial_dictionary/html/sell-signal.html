<h1>Sell Signal</h1>

<p>An event or condition that alerts investors to dispose of a particular investment. Sell signals may be observed by attentive analysts and investors with a good understanding of the stock market, while some investors prefer to rely on trading software or charts to tell them when to sell.</p>

<p>Some investors tend to simply follow the crowd, selling when everyone else thinks they see a sell signal.</p>

<p>A poorly performing market may appear to be an obvious sell signal, but many contrarian investors see this as a strong buy signal as long as the companies underlying the stocks are still fundamentally sound. Purchasing undervalued stocks when they are selling at a "discount" like this has helped many investors achieve excellent returns.</p>
