<h1>Nostro Account</h1>

<p>A bank account held in a foreign country by a domestic bank, denominated in the currency of that country. Nostro accounts are used to facilitate settlement of foreign exchange and trade transactions. The term is derived from the Latin word for "ours." Conversely, accounts that are held by the domestic bank in its home country for foreign banks are called vostro accounts, derived from the Latin word for "yours."</p>

<p>For example, a U.S. bank may have nostro accounts with one or more Canadian banks. These accounts will be denominated in Canadian dollars, which enables efficient settlement of transactions that are Canadian dollar denominated. Nostro accounts also minimize the exposure of the U.S. bank to undue exchange rate risk.</p>
