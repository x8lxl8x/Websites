<h1>Gilt-Edged Securities </h1>

<p>High-grade bonds that are issued by a government or firm. This type of security originally boasted gilded edges, thus the name. In the case of a firm, a gilt-edged security is a stock or bond issued by a company that has a strong record of consistent earnings and can be relied on to cover dividends and interest.</p>

<p>Gilt-edged securities are a high-grade investment with very low risk. Typically, these are issued by blue chip companies that dependably meet dividend or interest payments because they are well-established and financially stable .</p>
