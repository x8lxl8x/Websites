<h1>Windstorm Hazard</h1>

<p>The risk that a property will sustain losses due to strong winds. Windstorm insurance, or storm insurance policy or endorsement, generally covers losses resulting from excessive wind and/or hail. Most homeowner's insurance policies exclude coverage for losses arising from windstorms, and if coverage is desired, a separate windstorm insurance policy or endorsement must be purchased.</p>

<p>Following several legal cases involving years of appeals after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it became evident that consumers require better education regarding the need for separate flood and wind peril policies. Insurance companies considered adding the wind peril to flood insurance policies, adding the flood peril to standard homeowners' policies, making improvements to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and requiring more strict building codes in coastal and floodplain regions. Currently, new and renewal homeowner's policy notifications include information regarding the absence of flood coverage in standard policies, and the need to consider this type of coverage.</p>
