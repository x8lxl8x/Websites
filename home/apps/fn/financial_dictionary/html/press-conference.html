<h1>Press Conference</h1>

<p>A meeting organized for the purposes of distributing information to the media and answering questions from reporters. Normally the press conference is led by the company's executive management or their appointed press liaison. Given the media's limited resources, it may be difficult to attract major media attention to a press conference unless the company has a truly unique or newsworthy announcement to share. Press conferences can also be issued in response to addressing public relations issues.</p>

<p>By inviting the press to special events, the company has a good opportunity to present a news story in the most favorable light. In other cases, lesser known companies may be looking to increase their stature in the media by making it easier for news agencies to cover company events. By gaining favorable media exposure, companies are able to gain greater brand recognition and authority in the market, usually at a much lower cost than would be required for a widespread advertising campaign.</p>
