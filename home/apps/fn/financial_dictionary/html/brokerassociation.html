<h1>Broker Association</h1>

<p>A permitted association between exchange members who have shared responsibility for the execution of orders placed by their customers. These members thereby gain access to a collective pool of un-transacted orders, and they share the profits and losses associated with trading activities.</p>

<p>Broker associations are permitted by regulatory bodies, and allow smaller exchange members to capitalize on economies of scale through cooperation and shared responsibilities.</p>
