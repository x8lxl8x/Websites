<h1>SEC Form 10-SB</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the General Form for Registration of Securities for Small Businesses. It is used to register the securities of small businesses that wish to trade on U.S. exchanges. Information typically included on SEC Form 10-SB includes the type of security being issued, key financial information of the issuer, and information about the company's management team.</p>

<p>SEC Form 10 is one of the most basic sources of information about these small businesses. It's especially valuable in helping investors and analysts understand the investment potential and risks associated with smaller companies. The SEC will no longer accept form 10-SB after February 4, 2008, but previously filed forms will remain in the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>
