<h1>Export</h1>

<p>A function of international trade whereby goods produced in one country are shipped to another country for future sale or trade. The sale of such goods adds to the producing nation's gross output. If used for trade, exports are exchanged for other products or services. Exports are one of the oldest forms of economic transfer, and occur on a large scale between nations that have fewer restrictions on trade, such as tariffs or subsidies.</p>

<p>Most of the largest companies operating in advanced economies will derive a substantial portion of their annual revenues from exports to other countries. The ability to export goods helps an economy to grow by selling more overall goods and services. One of the core functions of diplomacy and foreign policy within governments is to foster economic trade in ways that benefit both parties involved.</p>
