<h1>Accounts Receivable Insurance</h1>

<p>A form of credit insurance offered by commercial insurers to businesses. Accounts receivable insurance can take the form of multi-buyer insurance (a pool of receivables) or key buyer insurance.</p>

<p>Accounts receivable insurance can be particularly useful for new or rapidly growing businesses that cannot afford to do credit checks. For a relatively low fee, accounts receivable insurance protects a company against loss on receivables, including default, bankruptcy or simply slow payment.</p>

<p>This insurance can also protect a company that is unable to collect receivables due to loss of the underlying records (for example, in a fire).</p>
