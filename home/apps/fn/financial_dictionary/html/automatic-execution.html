<h1>Automatic Execution</h1>

<p>A method of executing trades without inputting them manually. In forex trading, Investors are able to trade at any time during the day or night through an automatic forex trading system. Automatic executions enable traders to execute trades based on certain technical indicators. Forex signal providers transmit and receive signals that allow for this type of trading.</p>

<p>Basically, this is a trade executed without the help of a dealer. These types of trade are done very quickly and in real time because they are automated. The lagging and slow system of manual executions don't allow traders to continually input transactions in rapid fire form like an automatic execution allows. Stop and/or limit orders can also be enabled through this form of trading. Forex traders should be careful using automated trading however, as trades will be processed even if fundamental conditions have changed.</p>
