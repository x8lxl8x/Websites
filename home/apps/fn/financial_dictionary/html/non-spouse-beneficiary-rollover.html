<h1>Non-Spouse Beneficiary Rollover</h1>

<p>A retirement plan asset rollover performed in the event of the death of the account holder, where the recipient is not the spouse of the deceased. The most common practice for a non-spouse beneficiary rollover, is that the recipient receives the balance in a one-time lump sum payment, subjecting them to full immediate taxation.</p>

<p>If the funds are rolled over into another retirement account, it must be named as a beneficiary account including both the deceased and beneficiary's names. Many retirement accounts require that the spouse be the sole beneficiary.</p>
