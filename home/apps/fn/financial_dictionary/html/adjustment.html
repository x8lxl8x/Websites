<h1>Adjustment</h1>

<p>The use of mechanisms by a central bank to influence a home currency's exchange rate. An adjustment is specifically made if the exchange rate is not pegged to another currency, meaning that the currency is valued according to a floating exchange rate. Because the central bank intervenes in the home currency's exchange rate to reduce short-term fluctuations, this is considered a managed floating exchange rate.</p>

<p>Central banks may become involved if they believe that movements in the home currency are too "extreme", especially since a rapid increase or decrease in a currency's value can lead to a significant effects on its economy. Inconsistent adjustment policies in terms of an exchange rate mechanism (ERM) result in uncertainty on the part of investors, and is referred to as a "dirty" managed exchange rate policy.</p>
