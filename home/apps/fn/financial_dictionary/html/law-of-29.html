<h1>Law Of 29</h1>

<p>A belief held by some marketers that on average a prospective customer will not purchase a good or service until they have been exposed to a marketing message 29 times. While the number of messages can differ a great deal when courting prospective clients, advocates of the law of 29 believe that a constant, "in your face" approach to marketing is the best way to sell a product or service.</p>

<p>The law of 29 is the basis behind drip marketing, a direct marketing approach that involves sending numerous promotional messages to prospective clients over a period of time. Drip marketers often employ the use of mass email marketing to reach a large client base and send their message repeatedly in the hope of turning prospects into customers through techniques such as the law of 29.</p>
