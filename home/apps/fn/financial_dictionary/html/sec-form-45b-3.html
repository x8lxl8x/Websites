<h1>SEC Form 45B-3</h1>

<p>A form filed with the SEC regarding the extension of credit previously requested. Form 45B-3 is a transitional form required by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</p>

<p>The Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935 was introduced as a result of events that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s. It remained in effect in substantially its original form for more than 55 years, until it was reformed by the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992. PUHCA was repealed in February 2006, following the ushering in of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.</p>
