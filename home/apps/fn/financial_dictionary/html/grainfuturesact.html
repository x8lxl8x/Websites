<h1>Grain Futures Act of 1922</h1>

<p>A federal statute passed in 1922 by the U.S Government that established the restriction that all grain futures need to be traded on regulated futures exchanges. The act also required exchanges to make more information public and limit the amount of market manipulation.</p>

<p>Enforcing this act became extremely difficult because disciplinary action was taken against the exchange itself rather than individual traders. This flaw was amended in 1936 and changed into the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).</p>
