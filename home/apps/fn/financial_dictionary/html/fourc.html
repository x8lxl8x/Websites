<h1>Four Cs</h1>

<p>The four characteristics used to determine the value of a diamond. The Four Cs of diamonds correspond to the <i>carat</i>, <i>cut</i>, <i>clarity</i> and <i>color</i>. The characteristics of a diamond are graded and categorized by the diamond industry to establish its retail value.</p>

<p><i>Cut </i>refers to the diamond's reflective properties.
<i>Clarity</i> refers to the occurrence of inner flaws or inclusions in the diamond.
<i>Color</i> refers to the presence or absence of a diamond's color. Colorless diamonds allow more light to pass through than colored diamonds.
<i>Carat</i> refers to the weight of the diamond. Larger diamonds are exponentially more valuable because of their rarity.</p>

<p>The diamond <i>certificate</i>, which is also called a grading report, is considered the fifth C. The fifth C is a complete evaluation of a diamond that has been executed by qualified professionals using specialized gemological instruments. The certificate details the diamond's exact measurements, weight and details of its cut and quality. In addition, the certificate identifies the diamond's unique characteristics. The certificate describes the diamond's quality, but it does not place a monetary value on the stone.</p>
