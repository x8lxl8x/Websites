<h1>Accelerated Bookbuild</h1>

<p>A form of offering in the equity capital markets. It involves offering shares in a short time period, with little to no marketing. The bookbuild of the offering is done vey quickly in one or two days. Underwriters may sometimes guarantee a minimum price and proceeds to the firm.
An accelerated bookbuild is often used when a company is in immediate need of financing and debt financing is out of the question. This can be the case when a firm is looking to make an offer to acquire another firm.</p>

<p>For example, BetandWin.com used an accelerated bookbuild to raise between 200 and 300 million euros to help fund the acquisition of Ongame E-Solutions, the operator of pokerroom.com, one of the most popular poker websites.           </p>
