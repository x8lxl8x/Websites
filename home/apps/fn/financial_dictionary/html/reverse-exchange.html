<h1>Reverse Exchange</h1>

<p>A type of property exchange wherein the replacement property is acquired first, and then the current property is traded away. Reverse exchanges were created in order to help buyers who found a new property that they would like to purchase before they were able to trade in a current property.</p>

<p>The opposite of a reverse exchange is a deferred exchange.</p>

<p>Standard like-kind exchange rules usually do not apply to reverse exchanges. The IRS has created a set of safe-harbor rules that allow for like-kind treatment, as long as either the current or new property is held in a qualified exchange accommodation arrangement (QEAA).</p>

<p>Reverse exchanges apply only to Section 1031 property. Section 1245 or 1250 property is ineligible for this type of transaction.</p>
