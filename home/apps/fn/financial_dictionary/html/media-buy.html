<h1>Media Buy</h1>

<p>The purchase of advertising from a media company such as a television station, newspaper, magazine, blog or website. The price of the media buy depends on the specifics of the advertising campaign.</p>

<p>On a website, the price would be determined by factors such as where the ad will be placed on the page, how many pages of the website the ad will appear on, how large the ad will be, how many days the ad will run for, how much traffic the website receives and the website's user demographics. The more exposure the advertiser is expected to receive, the more expensive the media buy will usually be.</p>
