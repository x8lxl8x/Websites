<h1>Profit Before Tax - PBT</h1>

<p>A profitability measure that looks at a company's profits before the company has to pay corporate income tax. This measure deducts all expenses from revenue including interest expenses and operating expenses, but it leaves out the payment of tax.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "earnings before tax ".</p>

<p>This measure combines all of the company's profits before tax, including operating, non-operating, continuing operations and non-continuing operations. PBT exists because tax expense is constantly changing and taking it out helps to give an investor a good idea of changes in a company's profits or earnings from year to year.</p>
