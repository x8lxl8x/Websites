<h1>Asia Ex-Japan</h1>

<p>The region of countries located in Southeast Asia, not including Japan. These countries are generally considered emerging markets and are of interest to investors looking for high-growth investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Many of the countries in Asia ex-Japan are said to have "tiger economies" because of their high-potential growth rates such as Thailand, China and South Korea. Mutual funds that are classified as Asia ex-Japan mainly focus on these potentially high-growth emerging markets. Japan is a highly developed economy which is why it is excluded.</p>
