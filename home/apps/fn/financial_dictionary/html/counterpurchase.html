<h1>Counterpurchase</h1>

<p>An exchange of goods between two parties that, by means of two contracts, agree to act as purchaser and supplier to each other and to purchase all goods in cash.</p>

<p>The first contract is the original sales contract, outlining the terms in which an initial buyer purchases from an initial seller. The second contract, a parallel contract, outlines the terms in which the original seller agrees to buy unrelated goods from the original buyer. Basically this is a contractually enforced relationship between two parties who agree, at some point, to provide business for one another.</p>
