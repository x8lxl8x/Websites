<h1>Wedge</h1>

<p>In technical analysis, a security price pattern where trend lines drawn above and below a price chart converge into an arrow shape. Wedge shaped patterns are thought by technical analysts to be useful in analyzing a short to intermediate term reversal of what the analyst feels to be the major price trend.</p>

<p>Once the price breaks out of the wedge, it is expected to return to the major trend. Technical analysts see a 'breakout' of this wedge pattern as either bullish (on a breakout above the upper line) or bearish (on a breakout below the lower line). A wedge shape pointing upwards (rising wedge) is used in analyzing an upward price trend within an overall downward price trend. A level wedge is considered a period of consolidation, which will not reverse the current major trend. Finally a wedge pointing downwards (falling wedge) is used to analyze a downward price trend within an overall upward price movement.</p>
