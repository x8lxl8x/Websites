<h1>Double Exponential Moving Average - DEMA </h1>

<p>A technical indicator developed by Patrick Mulloy that first appeared in the February, 1994 <i>Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities</i>. The DEMA is a calculation based on both a single exponential moving average (EMA) and a double EMA.</p>

<p>The DEMA is a fast-acting moving average that is more responsive to market changes than a traditional moving average. It was developed in an attempt to create a calculation that eliminated some of the lag associated with traditional moving averages. The DEMA can be used as a stand-alone indicator and can be incorporated into other technical analysis tools whose logic are based on moving averages.</p>
