<h1>Off Board</h1>

<p>A stock transaction that fits one of the following two criteria:</p>

<p>1. A stock trade involving a security that does not trade on a major exchange, i.e., an over-the-counter (OTC) stock.</p>

<p>2. A stock trade involving a stock that is listed on a major exchange but is still executed over the counter, typically between two institutions or an institution and a customer. This type of off-board trade can be done only with 19c3 securities, or stocks that listed on the exchange after 1979.</p>

<p>Off-board trades of the latter type will usually involve two brokerage firms or other institutions and involve a large number of shares. The two parties will decide to do a trade off board to prevent order distortions within the underling stock, as well as keep relative anonymity in the broad markets.</p>

<p>The term "off board" refers to the fact that the venerable New York Stock Exchange is commonly known as the Big Board.</p>
