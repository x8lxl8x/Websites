<h1>Trailer Fee</h1>

<p>A fee that a mutual fund manager pays to a salesperson who sells the fund to investors. The trailer fee pays the salesperson for providing the investor with ongoing investment advice and services.</p>

<p>Also known as a "trailer commission".</p>

<p>It is important to know whether your mutual fund salesperson is receiving a trailer fee because it may cause him or her to try to sell you a particular fund not because it is a good investment but because selling it to you will make him or her money. This fee is paid annually for as long as the investor holds shares in the fund.</p>
