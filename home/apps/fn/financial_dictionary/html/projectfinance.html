<h1>Project Finance</h1>

<p>Defined by the International Project Finance Association (IPFA) as the following:</p>

<p>The financing of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects and public services based upon a non-recourse or limited recourse financial structure where project debt and equity used to finance the project are paid back from the cashflow generated by the project.</p>

<p>In other words, project financing is a loan structure that relies primarily on the project's cash flow for repayment, with the project's assets, rights, and interests held as secondary security or collateral.</p>

<p>Project finance is especially attractive to the private sector because they can fund major projects off balance sheet.</p>
