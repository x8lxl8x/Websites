<h1>Inflexible Expense</h1>

<p>An expense that cannot be easily eliminated by the firm or person incurring the cost. An inflexible expense represents a recurring debt, which may affect the borrower's ability to attain higher levels of credit.</p>

<p>An inflexible expense will often have a fixed amount, leaving the borrower unable to alter its payment stream. For an individual, a typical inflexible expense would be mortgage or car payments, both of which have a fixed schedule of repayment. For companies, expenses such as interest charges and employee wages represent inflexible expenses.</p>
