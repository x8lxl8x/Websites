<h1>International Investing</h1>

<p>The strategy of selecting globally-based investment instruments as part of an investment portfolio. International investing includes such investment vehicles as mutual funds, American Depository Receipts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or direct investments in foreign markets. People often invest internationally for diversification, to spread the investment risk among foreign companies and markets; and for growth, to take advantage of emerging markets.</p>

<p>International investments can be included in an investment portfolio to provide diversification and growth opportunities. All types of investments involve risk, and international investing may present special risks, including:
-Fluctuations in currency exchange rates
-Changes in market value
-Significant political, economic and social events
-Low liquidity
-Less access to important information
-Foreign legal remedies
-Varying market operations and procedures</p>
