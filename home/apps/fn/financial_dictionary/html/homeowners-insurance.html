<h1>Homeowners Insurance</h1>

<p>A form of property insurance designed to protect an individual's home against damages to the house itself, or to possessions in the home. Homeowners insurance also provides liability coverage against accidents in the home or on the property.</p>

<p>In the U.S. there are seven forms of homeowners insurance that have become standardized in the industry; they range in name from HO-1 through HO-8 and offer various levels of protection depending on the needs of the homeowner.</p>

<p>Also known as "homeowner's/homeowners' insurance."</p>

<p>While homeowners insurance covers most scenarios where loss could occur, some events are typically excluded from policies, namely: earthquakes, floods or other "acts of God" and acts of war.</p>

<p>For people who live in certain parts of the country, adding an extra policy for earthquake insurance or flood insurance can be a good idea to offer further home protection and peace of mind. Some homeowners insurance is designed for renters, typically HO-4 or "renters insurance", and only covers possessions within the home and isolated events not covered in the property insurance held by the owner.</p>
