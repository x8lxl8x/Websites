<h1>Pennant</h1>

<p>A continuation pattern in technical analysis formed when there is a large movement in a stock, the flagpole, followed by a consolidation period with converging trendlines, the pennant, followed by a breakout movement in the same direction as the initial large movement, the second half of the flagpole.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the above picture, there is a large rise in the stock, followed by a converging consolidation period that resembles a pennant and a resulting continuation of the initial trend.</p>

<p>Pennants, which are similar to flags in terms of structure, have converging trendlines during their consolidation period and they last from one to three weeks. The volume at each period of the pennant is also important. The initial move must be met with large volume while the pennant should have weakening volume, followed by a large increase in volume during the breakout.</p>
