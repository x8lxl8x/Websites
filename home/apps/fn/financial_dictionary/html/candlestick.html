<h1>Candlestick</h1>

<p>A chart that displays the high, low, opening and closing prices for a security for a single day. The wide part of the candlestick is called the "real body" and tells investors whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price (black/red if the stock closed lower, white/green if the stock closed higher). The candlestick's shadows show the day's high and lows and how they compare to the open and close. A candlestick's shape varies based on the relationship between the day's high, low, opening and closing prices.

<p>Candlesticks reflect the impact of investors' emotions on security prices and are used by technical analysts to determine when to enter and exit trades. Candlestick charting is based on a technique developed in Japan in the 1700s for tracking the price of rice. There are many short-term trading strategies based upon candlestick patterns, such as the engulfing pattern, harami, harami cross and evening star.</p>
