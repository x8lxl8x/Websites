<h1>Generic Brand</h1>

<p>A type of consumer product that lacks a widely recognized name or logo because it typically isn't advertised. Generic brands are usually less expensive than brand-name products due to the lack of promotions, which can inflate the cost of a good or service. Generic brands are designed to be substitutes for more expensive brand-name goods.</p>

<p>Generic brands are known for their trimmed-down packaging, and often plain labels. For example, a supermarket may offer its own generic product next to a name-brand product in the hope that a cost-conscious customer will select the cheaper substitute. Generic brands have grown in popularity in recent years, and many retailers now offer in-house generic products to customers.</p>
