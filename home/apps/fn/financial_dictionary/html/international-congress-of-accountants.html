<h1>World Congress Of Accountants - WCOA</h1>

<p>The leading international symposium for the accountancy profession. The World Congress of Accountants (WCOA) brings together leaders in accounting, business and regulation to explore current issues and innovations on an international and regional level. It is organized by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), in collaboration with the national accounting organization of the host country and other sponsors.</p>

<p>Dubbed as the "Olympics of the accountancy profession," the congress was first held in St. Louis in 1904. It was held in a different city every five years, but as of 2000 it has been held every four years. The 18th World Congress of Accountants, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2010, attracted 6,000 delegates from 134 countries. The Congress has accelerated the development of international standards in accounting and auditing.</p>
