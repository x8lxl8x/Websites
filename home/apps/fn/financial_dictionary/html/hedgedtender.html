<h1>Hedged Tender</h1>

<p>A strategy in a tender offer where an investor short sells a portion of the shares he or she owns. This strategy is used to protect against the risk of loss in the event that the tender offer does not go through.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a stock was trading at $30, and there was a tender offer for $40 per share. A hedged tender would attempt to lock in the $40 per share even if the offer does not go through.</p>
