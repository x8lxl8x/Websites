<h1>Income Effect</h1>

<p>In the context of economic theory, the income effect is the change in an individual's or economy's income and how that change will impact the quantity demanded of a good or service. The relationship between income and the quantity demanded is a positive one, as income increases, so does the quantity of goods and services demanded.</p>

<p>For example, when an individual's income increases, other things remaining the same, that person will demand more goods and services; thus increasing their consumption. The degree to which a person or economy will spend more of their income on consumption is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The MPC depends on the individual's or economy's saving characteristics.</p>
