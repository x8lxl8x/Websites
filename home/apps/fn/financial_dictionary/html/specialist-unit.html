<h1>Specialist Unit</h1>

<p>A group of firms or individuals that act as a market maker for one or many stocks trading on an exchange. A specialist unit maintains a stable market in a given security by acting as both a principal and agent for brokers. As a principal, a specialist unit will hold its own inventory of stock, in order to facilitate liquidity for a given trade.</p>

<p>Specialist units are also responsible for posting relatively narrow bid-ask spreads to maintain liquidity, managing limit orders and large block orders. Additionally, a specialist unit will act as a form of balance in the market by taking the opposing side of bullish or bearish sentiment for a given stock by trading out of its own inventory.</p>
