<h1>Profits Interest</h1>

<p>A monetary right awarded to the general partner, investment manager or a service provider of a partnership. The award consists of receiving a percentage of profits from a partnership without having to contribute capital to the partnership.  Profits interests are often criticized as recipients can generate large profits for themselves while not incurring sufficient risk.</p>

<p>This method serves as an incentive for partners to become more proactive in pursuing bigger and better profits thus contributing towards the companies' growth. This situation presents a tax benefit in that beneficiaries of this instrument can be taxed under long-term capital gains versus the higher federal tax rate.</p>
