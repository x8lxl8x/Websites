<h1>State Administrator</h1>

<p>The government agency or official who oversees and enforces state-level regulations regarding securities transactions. Model legislation called the Uniform Securities Act guides each state in setting its own laws for securities transactions that do not fall under federal regulation. The state administrator's job is to protect investors from securities fraud at the state level.</p>

<p>The state administrator essentially acts like the federal securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, on matters that do not fall under the SEC's purview. A state administrator's role includes the ability to bar, censure, restrict or suspend registered organizations or individuals who fail to adhere to the terms set forth in the Uniform Securities Act. These terms include willful securities violations, unethical business practices, felony convictions and other such infractions.</p>
