<h1>Amenity</h1>

<p>Benefits of a property whose existence increase the value or desirability of that property. An amenity can be either tangible, such as a swimming pool or gym, or intangible, such as proximity to a local school or supermarket.</p>

<p>By making improvements to a property (tangible amenities) or by the property being located in a more desirable area, real estate developers and hotel owners can increase the price that they sell or rent a piece of property for. Home buyers should consider what the amenity is truly worth to them, since some amenities carry ongoing costs, such as a swimming pool.</p>
