<h1>SEC Form 1-N</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Registration as a National Securities Exchange for Futures Trading. It is used by parties who wish to establish an exchange for trading futures. SEC Form 1-N is one of the most complex filing forms used by the SEC, as it requires extensive disclosures.</p>

<p>While most investors will never have a reason to examine a SEC Form 1-N, those wishing to truly understand the inner workings of the futures and commodities markets depend on it. The SEC Form 1-N is one of the best sources of information as to who the key players are behind an exchange.</p>
