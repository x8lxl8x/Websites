<h1>Regulation 9</h1>

<p>A regulation that permits national banks to open and operate trust departments in-house and function as fiduciaries. Regulation 9 allows national banks to manage and administrate investment-related activities. They can register stocks, bonds and other securities and act as trustees for them.</p>

<p>Although Regulation 9 gives banks permission to engage in trust-related activities at a federal level, banks must still adhere to state statutes as well. This regulation was issued by the Comptroller of the Currency Department. However, it only applies to national banks and not regional or local entities.</p>
