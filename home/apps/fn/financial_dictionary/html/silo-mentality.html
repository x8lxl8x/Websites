<h1>Silo Mentality</h1>

<p>An attitude found in some organizations that occurs when several departments or groups do not want to share information or knowledge with other individuals in the same company. A silo mentality reduces efficiency and can be a contributing factor to a failing corporate culture.</p>

<p>Managers of successful firms spend a lot of their time trying to ensure that information flows freely between departments to ensure that all aspects of the company are functioning effectively. Contemporary management views suggest that the silo mentality mindset must be broken in order for employees to remain motivated and be happy to come to work. Efficient companies promote the sharing of information in an attempt to let the combination of groups function as a team.</p>
