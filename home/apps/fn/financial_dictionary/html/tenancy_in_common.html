<h1>Tenancy In Common</h1>

<p>A way for two or more people to have equal ownership interests in a property. Each owner has the right to leave his or her share of the property to any beneficiary upon the owner's death. Each party (owner) in a tenancy-in-common agreement has the right to use the property even if the physical size of the stake is different.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that tenancy in common is different than joint tenancy because the transfer of the property to a beneficiary in the event of an owner's death is different in each case. In a joint tenancy agreement, the title of the property is passed to the surviving owner, while in a tenancy-in-common agreement, the title can be passed to a beneficiary of the owner's choosing.</p>
