<h1>1040A Form</h1>

<p>A simplified version of the 1040 form for individual income tax. To be eligible to use a 1040A form, an individual must fulfill certain requirements such as not itemizing deductions, not owning a business and having a taxable income of less than $100,000.</p>

<p>Unofficially known as the "short form".</p>

<p>While the form can be slightly more complex compared to the "1040EZ", it is still relatively simple in comparison to the 1040. Once an individual's financial situation becomes complicated with dependents, special deductions and credits (such as those associated with post secondary education tuition), most taxpayers will often need to switch from filing with the 1040EZ to the 1040A.</p>
