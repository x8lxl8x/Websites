<h1>Capital Appreciation Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that attempts to increase asset value primarily through investments in growth stocks. The heavy investment in growth stocks increases the risk associated with these types of funds.</p>

<p>Also called "aggressive growth fund".</p>

<p>As its name suggests, a capital appreciation fund seeks to deliver value to shareholders by investing in companies with appreciating share prices.</p>

<p>This type of fund is the exact opposite of an income or dividend fund, which focuses on investing in companies that pay shareholders a dividend. In addition to risk tolerance, something else to consider when analyzing these different types of funds is the fact that capital gains are usually taxed lower than interest income.</p>
