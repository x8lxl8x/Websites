<h1>Garbatrage</h1>

<p>An increase in price and trading volume in a particular sector of the economy that occurs as a result of a recent takeover, which initiates a change in sentiment toward the sector.</p>

<p>Garbatrage is also known as "rumortrage".</p>

<p>Garbatrage is usually used to refer to firms that are not directly related to the takeover. Speculators feel that the initial takeover is a precursor to more takeovers within the sector. Proponents of behavioral finance theory would view this psychological impact as evidence that supports their theory.</p>
