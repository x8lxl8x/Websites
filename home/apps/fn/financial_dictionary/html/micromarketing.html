<h1>Micromarketing</h1>

<p>A marketing strategy in which advertising efforts are focused on a small group of highly-targeted consumers. Micromarketing requires a company to narrowly define a particular audience by a particular characteristic, such as ZIP code or job title, and tailor campaigns for that particular segment. It can be a more expensive technique due to customization and lack of an economy of scale.</p>

<p>Micromarketing grew to prominence in the 1990s, as personal computers allowed easier segmentation and dissemination of information to customers. E-commerce websites are able to track the type of products that a consumer views or purchases, which allows the website to suggest related products.</p>
