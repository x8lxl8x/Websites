<h1>Requisitioned Property</h1>

<p>Property that is involuntarily seized by a governmental authority for any reason. Requisitioned property can be taken for a number of reasons relating to furtherance of the public good. It can be of any type, including real estate, vehicles, machinery, office equipment or even personal property.</p>

<p>Requisitioned property can be treated as an involuntary conversion. Property sold under the threat of requisition can also be treated as a conversion if the threat is believed to be genuine and imminent. However, the threat of requisition must be confirmed by an actual governmental official and cannot be derived solely from a public announcement. In most cases, the requisition will be presented as a formal written demand.</p>
