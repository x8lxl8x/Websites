<h1>Transportation Bond</h1>

<p>Fixed-income obligations of issuers that own and operate transportation systems such as ports, highways, bridges and public transit. Transportation bonds may also refer to bonds issued by companies that operate in the transport sector, including airlines, railroads and trucking companies.</p>

<p>Transportation bonds can also be issued by state governments to fund statewide projects. These bonds may therefore carry a higher credit rating than bonds issued by transport companies. The ability of transportation issuers to service their bonds depends on a number of factors including the state of the economy, competition from other modes of transport and the extent of government subsidization.</p>
