<h1>Designated Roth Account</h1>

<p>An individual retirement plan in which employees can have all or a portion of contributions to a 401(k) or 403(b) placed into a separate Roth retirement account. Contributions made to a designated Roth account are considered to be to a separate account within the 401(k) or 403(b) plan, and contributions, gains and losses are accounted for separately from regular 401(k) or 403(b) contributions.</p>

<p>Employers can make matching contributions to the designated Roth account, just as they can to 401(k) or 403(b) accounts. Investors can make contributions to both a pre-tax, traditional retirement account and a designated Roth account during the same tax year, but the total contributions are subject to an annual contribution limit.</p>
