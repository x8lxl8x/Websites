<h1>Real-Time Quote</h1>

<p>This is the actual price of a security at that moment in time. Most prices of securities that are displayed on various websites are delayed quotes. These quotes are usually delayed from 15 to 20 minutes. Real-time quotes are instantaneous with no delay.</p>

<p>A basic quote on a security consists of a bid price and an ask price. The bid price is what sellers would receive for the security and the ask price is what buyers must pay for the security. The more volume that is traded on a security will bring the bid and ask prices closer together.</p>
