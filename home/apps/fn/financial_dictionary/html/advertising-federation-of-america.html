<h1>Advertising Federation Of America - AFA</h1>

<p>A regional advertising group based on the U.S. East Coast that was formed uphold high advertising standards and also to protect and promote the advertising trade. Its predecessor organization, the National Federation of Advertising Clubs, was formed in 1905 by the merger of a number of local advertising clubs. The AFA and its West Coast counterpart the Advertising Association of the West (AAW) worked independently until 1967 to raise advertising standards through self-regulation and education.</p>

<p>The 1967 merger of the AFA and AAW created the American Advertising Federation (AAF), the unifying voice for advertising in the United States. The AAF is the oldest national advertising trade association in the U.S., representing over 40,000 advertising professionals. Its initiatives include a national conference, the Advertising Hall of Fame, the Advertising Hall of Achievement and the world's largest advertising competition - the ADDY Awards.</p>
