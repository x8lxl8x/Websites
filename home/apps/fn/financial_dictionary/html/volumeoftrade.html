<h1>Volume Of Trade</h1>

<p>The total quantity of futures contracts bought and sold during a trading day. The volume of trade numbers, reported as often as once an hour throughout the current trading day, are estimates. Final, actual figures are reported the following day. In the meantime, investors can use tick volume, or the number of changes in a contract's price, as a surrogate for trade volume, since prices tend to change more frequently with a higher volume of trade.</p>

<p>Volume tells investors about the market's liquidity. Higher volume means higher liquidity and better order execution. When investors feel hesitant about the direction of the stock market, futures trading volume tends to increase. Volume also tends to be higher near the market's opening and closing times, and on Mondays and Fridays. It tends to be lower at lunchtime and before a holiday.</p>
