<h1>Alfred Nobel</h1>

<p>The man after whom the Nobel Prize is named. Nobel, born in 1833 in Stockholm, was a scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, author and pacifist. He patented an explosive called nitroglycerin, founded several companies and patented dynamite and gelignite, among other accomplishments. He became wealthy in the process.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize came into existence shortly after Nobel's death in 1896. He left much of his large estate to establish the prize, which was first awarded in 1901. The prize is given in several subjects, reflecting Nobel's diverse interests and abilities. These subjects are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. The prize is a medal, certificate and cash award.</p>
