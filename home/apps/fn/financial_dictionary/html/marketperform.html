<h1>Market Perform</h1>

<p>An investment rating used by analysts when the expectation for a given stock or investment is that it will provide returns in line with those of the S&P 500 or other leading market averages.</p>

<p>Market perform is a neutral assessment of a stock and is neither strongly positive or negative. If, however, the stock has gone through a period of market underperformance, it is an indication that the stock is expected to improve its performance relative to market averages.</p>

<p>The phrase "market perform" tends to be a fairly lukewarm recommendation overall. A preferred investment vehicle would be one that is expected to outperform, or do better than, leading market averages.</p>

<p>A "market perform" rating can be equated to such ratings as "hold" or "peer perform".</p>
