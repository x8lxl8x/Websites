<h1>Bunny Bond</h1>

<p>A type of bond that offers investors the option to reinvest coupon payments into additional bonds with the same coupon and maturity.</p>

<p>Also known as "multiplier bond" or "guaranteed coupon reinvestment bond."</p>

<p>Bunny bonds are an effective way to protect against reinvestment risk, which arises from the possibility that interest rates will drop in the future. With a normal bond, investors are exposed to the risk of having to reinvest their coupons at a lower interest rate. If an investor chooses to reinvest all cash coupons back into the bond he is currently holding, it behaves similarly to a zero-coupon bond, as the investor receives no cash flow until maturity.</p>
