<h1>Market Sentiment</h1>

<p>The overall attitude of investors toward a particular security or larger financial market. Market sentiment is the feeling or tone of a market, or its crowd psychology, as revealed through the activity and price movement of the securities traded in that market. For example, rising prices would indicate a bullish market sentiment, while falling prices would indicate a bearish market sentiment. Market sentiment is also called "investor sentiment" and is not always based on fundamentals.</p>

<p>Market sentiment is important to day traders and technical analysts, who use technical indicators to attempt to measure and profit from the short-term price changes often caused by investors' attitudes toward a security. Market sentiment is also important to contrarian investors, who like to trade in the opposite direction of the prevailing sentiment. For example, if everyone is buying, a contrarian would sell.</p>
