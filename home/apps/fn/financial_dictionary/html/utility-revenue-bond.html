<h1>Utility Revenue Bond</h1>

<p>A type of municipal bond that is issued to finance utility projects, such as electrical plants, water systems, sewer systems or any other type of public utility. A utility revenue bond is repaid from monies earned through the utility improvements, once the project has been completed and the utility is operating.</p>

<p>A bond is an interest-bearing or discounted debt security that is issued by a government or corporation in order to raise funds for capital projects. Generally, utility revenue bonds have one year's worth of debt service in what is called a reserve fund, to protect bondholders in the event that the project is not completed on time (and is not earning revenue) or where revenues are otherwise less than anticipated.</p>
