<h1>Deal Blotter</h1>

<p>A trader's record of all the transactions executed on a given day. The deal blotter contains basic information pertinent to a transaction, with additional information included on the deal slip. The deal blotter for a forex trader would include both opening and closing currency positions initiated by the trader.</p>

<p>In a forex trading firm with several traders, the sum of the positions on all the traders' deal blotters at the end of the trading day will indicate the change in the firm's net position at close. While deal blotters were paper-based before the advent of computerization, they are now increasingly computer-based, enabling traders to analyze and monitor their currency trades more rapidly and efficiently.</p>
