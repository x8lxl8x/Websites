<h1>State Medicaid Program</h1>

<p>Health initiatives managed by state governments in conjunction with the federal Medicaid program that help qualified low-income individuals and families pay for the costs associated with healthcare. State Medicaid programs use federal funding along with their own state funding to provide needed health services for eligible individuals, where eligibility is based on numerous factors, including income, assets, age, disability and citizenship.</p>

<p>Medicaid is a voluntary program in which states can participate. State programs vary, with some states renaming their Medicaid programs, such as California's "Medi-Cal" and Tennessee's "TennCare". Additionally, some states have also sought out the services of private health providers to administer portions of their state Medicad, usually referred to as Medicaid managed care.</p>
