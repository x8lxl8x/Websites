<h1>Reverse Gold ETF</h1>

<p>Exchange traded funds that are designed to trade in a direction that is diametrically opposite to gold bullion. Reverse gold ETFs, or inverse gold ETFs as they are better known, are generally used by investors to hedge against a downward move in gold prices, or by speculators to execute a bearish trade in gold. They typically deliver the inverse of the daily return of physical gold; leveraged inverse gold ETFs deliver a multiple (2x or 3x) of the daily inverse return of gold.</p>

<p>Inverse gold ETFs enable retail investors to take a bearish view on gold with limited amount of capital. For example, an investor who wishes to hedge $5,000 of gold exposure can buy an inverse gold ETF. Assume the ETF units are trading at $10, so the investor buys 500 ETF units. If the price of gold falls by 4% the next day, the ETF units should trade 4% higher, or around $10.40. The increase in the value of the inverse ETF units thus offsets the decline in the investor's gold stocks portfolio.</p>

<p>Since their performance depends on the daily return of gold, inverse gold ETFs - like all such ETFs - may underperform during periods of heightened volatility in gold prices.</p>
