<h1>Charles Biderman</h1>

<p>The founder and CEO of TrimTabs Investment Research, an investment research company that focuses on stock prices as a function of liquidity rather than value and publishes daily detailed independent research. Biderman describes this philosophy in his book, <i>TrimTabs Investing: Using Liquidity Theory to Beat the Stock Market</i>. He is regularly interviewed by and quoted in major financial media. Many top hedge funds use TrimTabs' research in their investment decisions.</p>

<p>Prior to founding TrimTabs in 1990, Biderman was a real estate investor who went bankrupt when the real estate market collapsed in the late 1980s. He states that this experience taught him the difference between value and price.</p>
