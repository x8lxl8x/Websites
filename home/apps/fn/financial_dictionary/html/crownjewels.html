<h1>Crown Jewels</h1>

<p>The most valuable unit(s) of a corporation, as defined by characteristics such as profitability, asset value and  future prospects. The origins of this term are derived from the most valuable and important treasures that sovereigns possessed.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that crown jewels are often the most valuable part of a company, some companies opt to use their crown jewels as part of a takeover defense. A company can employ this crown jewels defense by creating anti-takeover clauses which compels the sale of their crown jewels if a hostile takeover occurs. This deters would be acquirers from attempting to take the firm over.</p>
