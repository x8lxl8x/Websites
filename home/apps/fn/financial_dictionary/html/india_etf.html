<h1>India ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that is based on a basket of securities listed on various exchanges in India. India ETFs aim to capture the major sectors of the Indian economy by owning a diversified mix of major companies that represent the majority of the total market capitalization of the Indian economy.</p>

<p>India has become a burgeoning economy with specific proficiency in knowledge-based sectors such as information technology, financials and healthcare. India ETFs carry a higher expense ratio than most domestic funds, but it should be noted that administrative costs will typically be higher when international investments are involved due to increased exchange costs and brokerage fees for trading on an international exchange.</p>
