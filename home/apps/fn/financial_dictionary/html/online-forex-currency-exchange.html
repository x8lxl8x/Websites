<h1>Online Currency Exchange </h1>

<p>An online system for exchanging one country's currency for another. There is no central exchange in the forex market because it is a network of computers that connect banks, brokers and traders together. Online currency exchanges are essentially forex brokers that allow for delivery of the currencies traded.</p>

<p>Online forex currency exchanges will often provide the service of an online currency converter along with the option to actually convert the currencies for a nominal fee. This fee is similar to the spread quoted in pips.</p>

<p>A couple of advantages of exchanging currencies online include being able to do it from the comfort of your home or office, and/or being able to lock in a preferred exchange rate at the time you see it, rather than having to run to the brick-and-mortar currency exchange and risk missing the rate because of market movements.</p>
