<h1>Defalcation</h1>

<p>1. Combining two or more debts to create one total debt. Defalcation can be legally carried out upon request or in death of one of the parties.</p>

<p>2. Theft or misuse of funds which were under the control of the defalcator but not owned by them. Defalcation is a form of embezzlement through the allocation of funds, or failure to account for received funds.</p>

<p>1. For example if Peter had a $100 debt to Diana  and Diana had a debt to Peter for $14, the debt could be combined. Peter would then owe Diana $86. This is not always legally possible without the consent of both parties.</p>

<p>2. The term defalcation is usually used in the context of public officials misappropriating public funds. There is a requirement of one party to be in control of someone else's account while allocating the funds in an inappropriate manner.</p>
