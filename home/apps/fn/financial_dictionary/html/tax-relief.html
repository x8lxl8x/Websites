<h1>Tax Relief</h1>

<p>Any program or incentive that reduces the amount of tax owed by an individual or business entity. Examples of tax relief include the allowable deduction for pension contributions, and temporary incentives such as tax credits for the purchase of new high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment.</p>

<p>Tax relief is intended to reduce the tax liability of an individual or business entity. Often, the tax relief is targeted at providing aid for a certain event or cause. For example, hurricane victims may be allotted some form of tax relief when a hard-hit area is declared a disaster area. Tax relief is also available periodically to support environmental causes, as seen with tax credits for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or the installation of energy-efficient windows.</p>
