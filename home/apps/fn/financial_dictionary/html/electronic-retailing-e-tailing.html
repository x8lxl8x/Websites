<h1>Electronic Retailing - E-tailing</h1>

<p>The sale of goods and services through the Internet. Electronic retailing, or e-tailing, can include business-to-business and business-to-consumer sales. E-tailing revenue can come from the sale of products and services, through subscriptions to website content, or through advertising.</p>

<p>It is a play on the words "retail" and "e-commerce."</p>

<p>E-tailing requires businesses to tailor traditional business models to the rapidly changing face of the Internet and its users. E-tailers are not restricted solely to the Internet, and some brick-and-mortar businesses also operate websites to reach consumers. Online retailing is normally referred to as e-tailing.</p>
