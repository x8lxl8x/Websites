<h1>Gun Jumping</h1>

<p>1. The illegal practice of soliciting orders to buy a new issue before registration of the initial public offering (IPO) has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p>2. Trading securities on the basis of information that has not yet been disclosed to the public.</p>

<p>The theory behind gun jumping is that investors should make decisions based on the full disclosure in the prospectus, not on the information disseminated by the company that has not been approved by the SEC. If a company is found guilty of "jumping the gun", the IPO will be delayed.</p>
