<h1>Honey Badger Stock Market</h1>

<p>A play on an Internet meme of 2011 made to relate to the stock market. The honey badger stock market is a stock market which continually gains in value and pushes past any technical or economic indicators that suggest that the stock market should not be performing as well as it is.</p>

<p>"The honey badger stock market don't care."</p>

<p>The reference to the honey badger relates to a popular online video from 2011 in which wildlife footage of honey badgers is narrated with a humorous tone and language. In short, the narrator praises the honey badger's assertiveness in the face of dangers in the wild and other factors.</p>

<p>The popular quote from the video was "honey badger don't care."</p>
