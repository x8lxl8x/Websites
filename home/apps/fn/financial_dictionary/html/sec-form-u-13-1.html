<h1>SEC Form U-13-1</h1>

<p>An application that doubles as both a request for approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for any mutual service company, or a declaration of organization and business conduct of a subsidiary service company. The SEC Form U-13-1 requires the company's name, address, contact information and form of organization as well as a listing of any non-utility related business activities. A description of the company's capitalization and security holdings is also required.</p>

<p>Both versions of the form are required by rule 88 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This form is now obsolete.</p>
