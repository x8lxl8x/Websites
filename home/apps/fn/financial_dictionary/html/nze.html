<h1>New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZE) .NZ</h1>

<p>The securities market in New Zealand. The New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX), based in Wellington, consists of the New Zealand Alternative Market, the New Zealand Stock Market and the New Zealand Debt Market. Together their purpose is to offer secure, liquid investments and opportunities to grow capital to individuals and companies alike.</p>

<p>The NZX originated in New Zealand's 1870s Gold Rush, when the country's four biggest gold mines served as financial centers and each had its own exchange. It wasn't until 1974 that these entities merged to form the contemporary New Zealand Stock Exchange. In 2003, the NZX officially became a limited liability company, with its new name being the New Zealand Exchange Limited.</p>
