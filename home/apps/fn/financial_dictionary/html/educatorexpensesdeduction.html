<h1>Educator Expenses Deduction</h1>

<p>An above-the-line deduction for teachers and other education professionals to compensate for unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the course of their teaching duties. The educator expenses deduction is intended to provide a measure of tax relief for teachers and educators.</p>

<p>This deduction is not subject to the 2% adjusted gross income (AGI) floor like most other unreimbursed employee expenses; it is a deduction for AGI and not an itemized deduction. An educator expenses deduction can be claimed by teachers, instructors, counselors, principals, and educational aides provided they work at least 900 hours in a given school year.</p>
