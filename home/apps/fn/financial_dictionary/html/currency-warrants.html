<h1>Currency Warrants</h1>

<p>A financial instrument used to hedge currency risk or speculate on currency fluctuations in foreign exchange markets. A currency warrant, like other option derivatives, gets its value from the underlying exchange rate - the warrant's value goes up and down with fluctuations in the underlying exchange rate. Also, currency warrants are priced the same way as currency options and allows holders the right to exchange an amount of one currency into another currency at a specified exchange rate before or on a specified date.</p>

<p>Typically, warrants are used to manage risk if you have exposure to a certain currency and wish to hedge against potential losses. The other common use of currency warrants is to speculate on the movement of exchange rates and earn a profit if your view is correct. The leverage in currency warrants allows users to gain more exposure to exchange rate movements.</p>
