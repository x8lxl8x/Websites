<h1>Gordon Gekko</h1>

<p>A fictional character who played the villain in the popular 1980s Oliver Stone movie <i>Wall Street</i>. Gekko's character, a ruthless and wildly wealthy investor and corporate raider, has become a cultural symbol for greed, as epitomized by the famous <i>Wall Street</i> quote, "Greed . . . is good." For his portrayal of Gekko's character, Michael Douglas won an Oscar.</p>

<p>Gekko's character was not specifically based on any real-life person, but is said to have been loosely modeled on junk-bond king Michael Milken, who went to prison on racketeering and fraud charges. Gekko's greed monologue is said to be based on a real-life commencement speech Ivan Boesky gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986.</p>
