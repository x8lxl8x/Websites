<h1>Modified Gross Lease</h1>

<p>A type of real estate rental agreement where the tenant pays base rent at the inception of the lease but in subsequent years pays the base plus a proportional share of some of the other costs associated with the property, such as property taxes, utilities, insurance and maintenance. For example, tenants of a property are required to pay their portion of the total heating expense of an office tower.</p>

<p>Modified gross leases are common in office space leasing where an office building is occupied by multiple tenants. A building where the monthly electric bill is $1000 would be split evenly between the tenants; therefore, if there are currently 10 renters of the property, they each pay $100.</p>
