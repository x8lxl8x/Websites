<h1>Buy A Bounce</h1>

<p>A strategy that focuses on buying a given security once the price of the asset falls toward an important level of support. Traders who "buy a bounce" attempt to profit from a short-term correction or "bounce" off of the identified support.</p>

<p>In order to use this strategy most effectively, a trader has to be sure that he or she is able to identify a valid level of support. Some traders may wish to enter a position before the signs of a bounce off of a support level, but generally this is a high-risk strategy and can result in devastating losses. Most traders will want to confirm a bounce off of a support level by using a combination of other technical indicators before entering a position.</p>
