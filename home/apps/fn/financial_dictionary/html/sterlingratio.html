<h1>Sterling Ratio</h1>

<p>A ratio used mainly in the context of hedge funds. This risk-reward measure determines which hedge funds have the highest returns while enduring the least amount of volatility. The formula is as follows:</p>

<p>This formula uses the average for risk (drawdown) and return over the past three years.  Drawdown is calculated at the maximum potential loss in the given year.</p>

<p>Just like the Calmar ratio, a higher Sterling ratio is generally better because it means that the investment(s) are receiving a higher return relative to risk.</p>

<p>The Sterling ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio and the Sortino ratio, as it also produces a risk-adjusted return measurement. The Sterling ratio, along with the Sortino ratio, is primarily used by hedge funds as a way of advertising superior risk management.</p>
