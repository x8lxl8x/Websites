<h1>Credit Reference</h1>

<p>A credit reference can be a report from a credit agency for either a business or an individual.  The term can also be used to mean a letter from a bank or other financial institution with whom a company has done business, confirming to third party that the company or individual is known to the financial firm as a good client.</p>

<p>Credit references are generally used to determine the creditworthiness of a person or individual. Credit agencies are used most often for this purpose, although individual letters of reference are sometimes necessary.  For example, an overseas business wishing to establish its credentials in the United States may obtain a number of credit references from other businesses, banks, vendors and customers.</p>
