<h1>Breaking The Syndicate</h1>

<p>The dissolution of a group of investment bankers that created a syndication to underwrite the issue of a particular security. Prior to termination of the agreement the underwriters must sell the securities at the offering price. The syndicate usually terminates 30 days after the sale date, but can be broken earlier upon mutual agreement of the participants.</p>

<p>Syndicates are usually broken due to one of two reasons: (1) the issue has been successfully distributed or (2) the underwriters cannot place the securities at the offer price. If the syndication is dissolved prior to 30 days following the security sale date group members are free to sell remaining holdings independent of original price restrictions.</p>
