<h1>Section 1256 Contract</h1>

<p>A type of investment defined by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a regulated futures contract, foreign currency contract, non-equity option, dealer equity option or dealer securities futures contract. Each contract held by a taxpayer at the end of the tax year is treated as if it was sold for its fair market value, and gains or losses are treated as either short-term or long-term capital gains. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for implementing the IRC.</p>

<p>Investors reports gains and losses for Section 1256 Contract investments by using Form 6781. Hedging transactions are treated differently.</p>

<p>More specific information can be found in Subtitle A (Income Taxes), Chapter 1 (Normal Taxes and Surtaxes), Subchapter P (Capital Gains and Losses), Part IV (Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
