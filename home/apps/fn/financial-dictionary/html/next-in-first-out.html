<h1>Next-In, First-Out - NIFO</h1>

<p>A method of valuation where the cost of a particular item is based upon the cost to replace the item rather than on it's original cost. This form of valuation is not one of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because it is said to violate the cost principle. The cost principle is an accounting concept that states that goods and services should be recorded at their original cost, not present market value.</p>

<p>For example, an item that originally cost $15, and has a replacement cost of $18, is sold for $28. With the NIFO valuation method, gross profit would be $10 ($28 minus $18), not $13. Some companies use this method during times when inflation is a factor. Companies will set a selling price on replacement-cost basis and use this method as a way to price the items it sells.</p>
