<h1>Asset Management Company - AMC</h1>

<p>A company that invests its clients' pooled fund into securities that match its declared financial objectives. Asset management companies provide investors with more diversification and investing options than they would have by themselves.</p>

<p>Mutual funds, hedge funds and pension plans are all run by asset management companies.  These companies earn income by charging service fees to their clients.</p>

<p>AMCs offer their clients more diversification because they have a larger pool of resources than the individual investor. Pooling assets together and paying out proportional returns allows investors to avoid minimum investment requirements often required when purchasing securities on their own, as well as the ability to invest in a larger set of securities with a smaller investment.</p>
