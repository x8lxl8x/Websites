<h1>Blamestorming</h1>

<p>A fusion of the words "blame" and "brainstorming" which is used to describe a meeting where participants determine who is responsible for a particular problem or failure. Blamestorming is essentially the identification of a scapegoat; if the source of the problem was obvious, blamestorming would not be necessary.</p>

<p>Blamestorming often has more to do with office politics and/or public relations than with actually solving a problem. Instead of productively focusing on how to avoid a similar failure or achieve superior results in the future, blamestorming assigns the fault to one or more individuals, which in a worst-case scenario results in their being fired.</p>
