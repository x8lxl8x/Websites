<h1>Multiple Support Agreement</h1>

<p>An agreement signed by two or more taxpayers who provide financial support for the same dependent. A multiple support agreement allows several persons who jointly support a single dependent to take turns claiming this person as a dependent on their tax returns. Multiple support agreements are used in such cases as when several children each contribute to the support of an aged parent.</p>

<p>The person who claims the dependent in a given year must submit a Form 2210 signed by all other parties to the agreement. This form gives the taxpayer permission to claim the dependent for that year. Each participant in a multiple support agreement must provide at least 10% of the dependent's support each year, and together the family members must provide more than 50% of the dependent's total support.</p>
