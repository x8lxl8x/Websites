<h1>Voluntary Accidental Death And Dismemberment Insurance - VAD&D</h1>

<p>A financial protection plan that provides a beneficiary with cash in the event that the policyholder is accidentally killed or loses a certain body part. Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance is an optional benefit offered by some employers. Premiums are based on the amount of insurance purchased, and this type of insurance can make sense for workers in occupations that place them at high risk of physical injury.</p>

<p>How much the policy will pay in the event of a claim depends not only on the amount of coverage purchased, but on the type of claim filed. For example, the policy might pay 100% if the policyholder is killed or becomes quadriplegic, but it might only pay 50% for the loss of a hand or the permanent loss of sight in one eye.</p>
