<h1>A/A2</h1>

<p>Usually the second- or third-highest rating that a rating agency assigns to a security or carrier. This rating signifies that there is a relatively low risk of default because the issuer or carrier is fairly stable. Investors and policyholders are therefore taking very little risk with these companies.</p>

<p>The ratings assigned by the various ratings agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can therefore be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of default. However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.</p>
