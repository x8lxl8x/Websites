<h1>Bank Discount Basis</h1>

<p>A quoting convention used by financial institutions when quoting prices for fixed-income securities sold at a discount, particularly U.S. Government issues. The quote is presented as a percentage of face value, and is determined by discounting the bond by using a 360-day-count convention, which assumes there are twelve 30-day months in a year.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "discount yield".</p>

<p>Differences in the day count convention used by the firm quoting a fixed-income security is subtle, but important. Over longer maturities, the day count convention will have a greater impact on the current 'price' of a bond than if the time to maturity is much shorter.</p>

<p>The 30/360 day-count convention is the standard when quoting government treasury bonds for banks.</p>
