<h1>Angelina Jolie Stock Index</h1>

<p>An index made up of a selection of stocks from companies associated with actress Angelina Jolie. Seen as one of the world's most influential celebrities, some analysts believe that companies connected with Jolie will outperform their competition.
The index was created by Fred Fuld of Stockerblog.com; it includes the stocks of movie studios and producers that have had a connection with Angelina Jolie, such as Sony (NYSE: SNE), Viacom (NYSE:VIA) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). Because Jolie's films usually earn large box-office revenues, the companies that produce these movies should have higher profits.</p>
