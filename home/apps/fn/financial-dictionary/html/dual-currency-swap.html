<h1>Dual Currency Swap</h1>

<p>A currency swap used to hedge the risk associated with the issuance of a dual currency bond. A dual currency swap allows the bond issuer to repay the principal and coupon in the base currency or another currency. Exchange rates are preset in dual currency swaps.</p>

<p>A dual currency swap is essentially a mirror of a dual currency bond; in a dual currency swap,  the issuer exchanges a floating rate for a fixed one. The bond issuer is willing to take on the currency risk in order to lower borrowing costs by making payments in a currency other than the base currency.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that a company borrows $50 million to update a manufacturing facility. In order to reduce borrowing costs, the company enters into a dual currency swap involving euros. The company pays the swap counterparty the $50 million for the equivalent amount of euros, and receives interest payments in dollars at a fixed rate (which allow the company to service the bond). Upon the bond's maturity, the company receives the $50 million, and pays the counterparty the equivalent value in euros.</p>
