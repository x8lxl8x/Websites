<h1>United States Aircraft Insurance Group - USAIG</h1>

<p>The nation's first aviation insurance company, founded in 1928 by World War I flying ace Reed McKinley Chambers and pilot David C. Beebe. The United States Aircraft Insurance Group was founded when Chambers realized a need for aviation insurance after the airline company that he had formed - Florida Airways - faced bankruptcy when four airplanes were lost to storms and one accident in 1926. Florida Airways had earned the first private air mail contract awarded by the United States government.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2003, USAIG celebrated its 75th anniversary. The insurance company is credited with furthering aviation by insuring historic events such as the first B-52 bomber flight, the Boeing 707 prototype, the 1969 lunar module flight, the Boeing 747's first commercial flight, and the development and testing of General Dynamics' F-111A fighter jet. In 1968, USAIG's founder Reed Chambers broke the sound barrier while flying in a Convair F-106 Delta Dart. USAIG also is active in promoting safety in flying, and publishes a series of Safety First posters several times each year.</p>
