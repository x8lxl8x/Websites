<h1>IRS Publication 526</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides information on how a taxpayer can claim deductions for charitable contributions. IRS Publication 526 outlines the types of organizations that qualify for charitable deductions, the amount of contributions that can be deducted from a tax obligation, how to report contributions and the type of contributions that qualify. Organizations that qualify for tax deductions are non-profit groups, including scientific, educational, charitable and religious organizations as well as those dedicated to preventing cruelty to children or animals.</p>

<p>Itemized deductions for charitable contributions must be made in Schedule A on Form 1040. Most organizations will be able to tell you whether contributions made to them will qualify for a deduction, however IRS Publication 78 also lists most organizations that qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions.</p>
