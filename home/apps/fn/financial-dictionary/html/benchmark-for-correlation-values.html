<h1>Benchmark For Correlation Values</h1>

<p>A benchmark or point of reference chosen by an investment fund to measure correlation values such as beta, the coefficient of correlation "r" and the coefficient of determination "r<sup>2</sup>."  These correlation values indicate the degree to which the fund's performance is related to its market (using the benchmark as a proxy for the market). A high correlation to its benchmark is generally considered to be favorable for the fund if their investment thesis closely follows the benchmark.</p>

<p>The relevant benchmark for correlation values depends on the fund's investing mandate. For example, a large-cap US equity fund would usually use the S&P 500 as its benchmark for correlation values, while a large-cap Canadian equity fund would use the S&P/TSX Composite index as its benchmark.</p>
