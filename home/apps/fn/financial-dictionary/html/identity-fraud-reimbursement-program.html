<h1>Identity Fraud Reimbursement Program</h1>

<p>A financial product that offers reimbursment for the costs associated with having been a victim of identity theft. These costs may include getting affidavits notarized for police and financial institutions, postage for sending certified mail to police and financial institutions, lost earnings resulting from time spent recovering one's identity, and legal fees.</p>

<p>In addition to providing monetary compensation, these programs often provide a wealth of information to victims on the steps they need to take to resolve the matter and clear up their credit reports. These programs tend to provide reimbursement ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 and can usually be purchased individually for around $25 to $50 annually. They may also be offered as an employee benefit or as an add-on product to other types of insurance. Some homeowners' insurance companies include this protection in their standard policies.</p>
