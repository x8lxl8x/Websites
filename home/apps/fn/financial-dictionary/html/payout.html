<h1>Payout</h1>

<p>The expected financial return from an investment over a given period of time. Payout may be expressed on an overall or periodic basis as either a percentage of the investment's cost or in a real dollar amount. Payout can also refer to the period of time in which an investment or a project is expected to recoup its initial capital investment and become minimally profitable.</p>

<p>Short for "time to payout", "term to payout" or "payout period".</p>

<p>In terms of financial securities like annuities and dividends, payouts refer to the amounts received at given points in time. For example, in the case of an annuity, payouts are made to the annuitant at regular intervals such as monthly or quarterly. With dividends, payouts are made by corporations to their investors and can be in the form of cash dividends or stock dividends.</p>
