<h1>Fund Flow</h1>

<p>The net of all cash inflows and outflows in and out of various financial assets. Fund flow is usually measured on a monthly or quarterly basis. The performance of an asset or fund is not taken into account, only share redemptions (outflows) and share purchases (inflows).</p>

<p>Net inflows create excess cash for managers to invest, which theoretically creates demand for securities such as stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>Investors and market analysts watch fund flows to gauge investor sentiment within specific asset classes, sectors, or for the market as a whole. For instance, if net fund flows for bonds funds during a given month is negative by a large amount, this would signal broad-based pessimism over the fixed-income markets.</p>
