<h1>Loan Application Fee</h1>

<p>A fee charged to process an application for a loan, such as a home mortgage from a lender or mortgage broker. Loan application fees are charged to cover some of the costs involved in processing the application including credit checks, property appraisals and basic administrative costs.</p>

<p>Loan application fees are pretty standard in the lending industry but should be carefully reviewed all the same. Not all loan applications will require you to pay a fee; for example, the lender may waive the fee in an attempt to secure your business. In general, the fee should only be a couple hundred dollars - higher fees should be viewed with some skepticism. Most application fees are nonrefundable, even if the lender decides to not offer credit to the individual applying for a loan.</p>
