<h1>Repatriation</h1>

<p>The process of converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country. The  amount that the investor will receive depends on the exchange rate between the two currencies being traded at the settlement time.</p>

<p>For example, if you are American, converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars is an example of repatriation. If the pound were held by a British financial institution, the dollars would be called eurodollars, therefore, when converting those eurodollars back to dollars, the investor would be exposed to foreign exchange risk.</p>
