<h1>Annual General Meeting - AGM</h1>

<p>A mandatory, public yearly gathering of a publicly traded company's executives, directors and interested shareholders. At the annual general meeting, the CEO and director typically speak, and the company presents its annual report, which contains information for shareholders about its performance and strategy. Shareholders with voting rights vote on current issues, such as appointments to the company's board of directors, executive compensation, dividend payments and auditors. Shareholders who do not attend the meeting in person are asked to vote by proxy, which can be done online or by mail.</p>

<p>The annual general meeting is typically the only time during the year when shareholders and executives interact. If a company needs to resolve a problem in between annual general meetings, it may call an extraordinary general meeting. Activist shareholders may use annual general meetings as an opportunity to express their concerns.</p>
