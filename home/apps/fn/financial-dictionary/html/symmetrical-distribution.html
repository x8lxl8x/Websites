<h1>Symmetrical Distribution</h1>

<p>A situation in which the values of variables occur at regular frequencies, and the mean, median and mode occur at the same point. Unlike asymmetrical distribution, symmetrical distribution does not skew. A symmetrical distribution is commonly shaped like a bell curve when depicted on a graph. If a line is drawn down the middle of the graph, the two sides will mirror each other.</p>

<p>Also called a "symmetric distribution" or "normal distribution".</p>

<p>A type of symmetrical distribution that is not shaped like a bell curve is a bimodal symmetric distribution. This graph is shaped like two bell curves placed side by side. The two sides of this graph still mirror each other; however, only the mean and median occur at the same point - the center of the graph. The modes occur at two points: the highest point in each of the two bell curves.</p>
