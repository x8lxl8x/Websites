<h1>Half-Year Convention For Depreciation</h1>

<p>A depreciation schedule that treats all property acquired during the year as being acquired exactly in the middle of the year. This means that only half of the full-year depreciation is allowed in the first year, with the remaining balance being deducted in the final year of the depreciation schedule, or the year that the property is sold.</p>

<p>The half-year convention for depreciation applies to both modified accelerated cost recovery systems and straight-line depreciation schedules. There is also a mid-quarter convention that is used instead of the half-year convention if the aggregate depreciable base of new property was greater than 40% and was used in service sometime during the last three months of the year.</p>
