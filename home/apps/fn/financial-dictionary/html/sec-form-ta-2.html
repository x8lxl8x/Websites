<h1>SEC Form TA-2</h1>

<p>A form completed by transfer agents when submitting its annual report of transfer activities.  Information collected on Form TA-2 is used by regulatory bodies for the oversight of transfer agents. Depending on the type of organization, SEC Form TA-2 is submitted to one of four regulatory agencies: Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p>Transfer agents perform transactions between companies that issue securities and their holders to include recording changes of ownership, cancelling and issuing certificates and distributing dividends</p>

<p>The provisions that regulate transfer agents are covered under section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Because there is no self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees transfer agents the SEC has created rules for transfer agents and periodically conducts transfer agents inspections.</p>
