<h1>Open-End Credit</h1>

<p>A pre-approved loan between a financial institution and borrower that may be used repeatedly up to a certain limit and can subsequently be paid back prior to payments coming due. The pre-approved amount will be set out in the agreement between the lender and the borrower.</p>

<p>Open-end credit is also refered to as a "line of credit" or "revolving line of credit".</p>

<p>Open-end credit agreements are advantageous to borrowers, as they exert more control over how much they borrow and when. In addition, interest is not usually charged on the part of the line of credit that is not used, which can lead to interest savings for the borrower.</p>
