<h1>Bundling</h1>

<p>A marketing strategy that joins products or services together in order to sell them as a single combined unit. Bundling allows the convenient purchase of several products and/or services from one company. The products and services are usually related, but they can also consist of dissimilar products which appeal to one group of customers.</p>

<p>Not all providers will mention bundling as an option to their customers; therefore, it is important to check whether you can bundle services together. Bundled services will often save consumers money.</p>

<p>For example, if you have two insurance policies (home and auto) through two separate companies, you might be able to bundle both policies together using only one company and reduce the total monthly payments. Bundling can also be used to switch several payments into one, making bill payments easier, even if it doesn't save money.</p>
