<h1>Coefficient of Determination</h1>

<p>A measure used in statistical model analysis to assess how well a model explains and predicts future outcomes. It is indicative of the level of explained variablity in the model. The coefficient, also commonly known as R-square, is used as a guideline to measure the accuracy of the model.</p>

<p>One use of the coefficient of determination is to test the goodness of fit of the model. It is expressed as a value between zero and one. A value of one indicates a perfect fit, and therefore, a very reliable model for future forecasts. A value of zero, on the other hand, would indicate that the model fails to accurately model the dataset.</p>
