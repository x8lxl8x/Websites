<h1>SEC Form PREM14C </h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by a registrant intending to be part of a merger or acquisition. SEC Form PREM14C applies to security holders who were entitled to vote on issues for which the company was not soliciting proxies. It provides security holders with information required by Schedule 14A as well as information about whether certain persons, such as directors, officers and associates, have an interest in corporate matters that differ from the interest of general shareholders, or intend to oppose action to be taken by the corporation. The form is required to state that proxies are not being solicited.</p>

<p>Form PREM14C, "preliminary information statement relating to merger or acquisition",  is required under Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form must be filed with the SEC 10 days before definitive information statements are distributed to shareholders and helps the SEC protect shareholders' rights by ensuring that they receive key information, clearly presented.</p>
