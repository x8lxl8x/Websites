<h1>Tim M. Donahue</h1>

<p>A former executive chairman of Sprint Nextel and former president and CEO of the Virginia-based cell phone company Nextel Communications. Nextel differentiated itself from its competitors with its unique digital technology and business-to-business services. The company's successful focus on serving businesses led it to count a large portion of Fortune 500 companies among its customers. Nextel's technology, combined with Donahue's strategies, increased the company's income and customer base while decreasing its debt and made Nextel a Fortune 300 company.</p>

<p>Born in 1949, Donahue earned his bachelor's degree in 1971 from John Carroll University, where he studied English literature. He did not enter the telecommunications industry until 1984. Prior to joining Nextel in 1996, he worked for MCI Communications Corp., McCaw Cellular Communications (which was acquired by AT&T), and AT&T.</p>
