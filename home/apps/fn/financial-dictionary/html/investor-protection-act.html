<h1>Investor Protection Act</h1>

<p>A component of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 designed to expand the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The act established a whistleblower reward for reporting financial fraud, increased liability for aiding and abetting, doubled funding to the SEC over a five-year period, and more. The act was part of regulators' attempt to prevent some of the problems that caused the financial crisis of 2008-2009 from reoccuring in the future.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 was created to improve accountability and transparency in the financial system. It included a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would regulate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.</p>
