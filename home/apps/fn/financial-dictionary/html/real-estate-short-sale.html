<h1>Real Estate Short Sale</h1>

<p>Any sale of real estate that generates proceeds that are less than the amount owed on the property. A real estate short sale occurs when the lender and borrower decide that selling the property and absorbing a moderate loss is preferable to having the borrower default on the loan. It is therefore an alternative to foreclosure.</p>

<p>Real estate short sales can be done only by mutual consent of borrower and lender. Both parties can benefit greatly from this type of transaction. Borrowers can avoid having a foreclosure appear on their credit report, while lenders can avoid substantial fees associated with foreclosure.</p>
