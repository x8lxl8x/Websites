<h1>Disinvestment</h1>

<p>1. The action of an organization or government selling or liquidating an asset or subsidiary. Also known as "divestiture".</p>

<p>2. A reduction in capital expenditure, or the decision of a company not to replenish depleted capital goods.
1. A company or government organization will divest an asset or subsidiary as a strategic move for the company, planning to put the proceeds from the divestiture to better use that garners a higher return on investment.</p>

<p>2. A company will likely not replace capital goods or continue to invest in certain assets unless it feels it is receiving a return that justifies the investment. If there is a better place to invest, they may deplete certain capital goods and invest in other more profitable assets.</p>

<p>Alternatively a company may have to divest unwillingly if it needs cash to sustain operations.           </p>
