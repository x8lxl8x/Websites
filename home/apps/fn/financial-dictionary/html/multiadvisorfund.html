<h1>Multi-Advisor Fund</h1>

<p>An investment fund that is managed by more than one investment manager, each with a particular specialty. The goal of the multi-advisor fund is to make investment decisions based on multiple professional opinions, rather than relying on a single person to have comprehensive knowledge of investment options.
The multi-advisor fund tends to have a very specific international focus; for example, a fund may invest in high-grade South American debt and Asian equities, with one manager responsible for South American debt and a team responsible for the Asian equities component. As investment options become more complex, multi-advisor funds become increasingly necessary to fully understand the markets and businesses in which we invest. "Multi-advisor fund" is most commonly used to describe a type of hedge fund.          </p>
