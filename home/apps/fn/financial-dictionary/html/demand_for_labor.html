<h1>Demand For Labor</h1>

<p>A concept that describes the amount of demand for labor that an economy or firm is willing to employ at a given point in time. This demand may not necessarily be in long-run equilibrium, and is determined by the real wage, firms are willing to pay for this labor, and the amount of labor workers are willing to supply at that wage.</p>

<p>Demand for labor increases market wages and more workers enter the market. But this higher cost of labor will mean that employers will use less labor because it's more expensive.</p>

<p>Assuming there are a large number of employers in a region, or that workers are highly mobile geographically, the wages that a company will pay workers is dependent on the competitive market wage for a given skill set. This means that any company is a wage taker, which is simply another way of saying companies must pay competitive wages in order to obtain workers.</p>
