<h1>Vittorio Mincato</h1>

<p>A former CEO of  Italian oil and gas company, Eni. He achieved the position of CEO in 1998 and held it until 2005, when Paolo Scaroni took over. Eni has a presence in 77 countries, and its activities include oil and gas exploration, production, transportation, transformation and marketing, in petrochemicals, oilfield services construction and engineering.</p>

<p>Mincato joined the company shortly after it had faced corruption scandals, downsizing and several conflicts with the Italian government - which owned about a third of the company. He helped move the company forward, leading Eni to its first acquisitions of foreign companies (Britain-based Borneo and Lasmo) and helping it to become the one of the world's largest oil corporations.</p>
