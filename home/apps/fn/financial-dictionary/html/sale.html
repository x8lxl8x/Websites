<h1>Sale</h1>

<p>1) In general, a transaction between two parties where the buyer receives goods (tangible or intangible), services and/or assets in exchange for money.</p>

<p>2) An agreement between a buyer and seller on the price of a security.</p>

<p>Every day, millions of people take part in countless sales transactions across the globe, creating a constant flow of value which forms the backbone of our economies. Sales of investment vehicles in the financial markets represent highly refined value exchanges.</p>

<p>For example, consider a typical middle-class person purchasing their first home.  Obviously, a sale occurs when the home is sold to the buyer. However, there are many layers of sales surrounding the deal. Very likely, a lending institution would sell financing, via a mortgage, to the homebuyer. Then, the lending institution likely sells that mortgage to another individual as an investment. An investment manager could earn a living trading bundles of mortgages and other kinds of debt financing.</p>
