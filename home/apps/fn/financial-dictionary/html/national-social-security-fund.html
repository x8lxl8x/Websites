<h1>National Social Security Fund (China)</h1>

<p>A government-controlled investment fund established primarily to provide a reserve of funds for China's social security system. The fund is managed by the National Council for Social Security Fund. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the National Social Security Fund has approximately $146.5 billion in assets.</p>

<p>Although the National Social Security Fund is an independent entity distinct from the Chinese government, the National Council for Social Security Fund that manages it is a ministerial-level government institution. These funds are set aside to support social security payments through periods when population trends draw the fund down by a greater amount than the contributions it receives.</p>
