<h1>Lease To Own</h1>

<p>An arrangement where an individual enters into a lease agreement with an owner with the inclusion of a clause that typically gives the individual the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the item leased at a predefined price and time. More often than not, a portion of the total rental payment goes toward paying down the value of the item leased in the event that the renter wishes to exercise the option.</p>

<p>For housing properties, the cost involved in lease-to-own agreements tend to be more expensive compared to standard rental agreements. In addition to paying rent, lease-to-own contract users need to pay an option fee, similar to an amount paid to buy a traditional stock option, and usually, a rent premium as well, which is not returned to the renter in the event that he or she does not exercise the option to buy the leased item.</p>
