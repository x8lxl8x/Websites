<h1>Broad Tape</h1>

<p>A modern version of the ticker tape produced by the Dow Jones news. The broad tape is posted on a screen in the boardroom of an investment firm. The broad tape provides a continual stream of investment, financial and business information for investors and brokers.</p>

<p>The broad tape is widely available to investors and professionals in many forms. It can be found both on television and on the internet, as well as through private subscription. However, it is prohibited on the floors of the exchanges in order to prevent traders from reacting to the news faster than the public.</p>
