<h1>Auditability</h1>

<p>The ability to achieve accurate results in the examination of a company's financial reporting. Auditability is dependent upon the company's financial recording practices, the transparency of the company and the forthrightness of the managers who interact with the auditors. A company with a great deal of transparency and complete records has greater auditability than a company whose records are incomplete and whose managers are evasive.</p>

<p>Auditability is an important factor in the auditing process. An audit is most effective when auditors are given access to the correct financial information. A company that is considered auditable allows auditors to do a more thorough and accurate assessment of the company's financials.</p>
