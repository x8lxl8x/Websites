<h1>United States Natural Gas Fund - UNG</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded security designed to track percentage changes in the price of natural gas delivered to Henry Hub, Louisiana, the main U.S. benchmark for natural gas. UNG invests primarily in futures contracts but also in natural gas related futures, forwards and swap contracts and obligations of the United States government with remaining maturities of two years or less.</p>

<p>The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) was introduced in April 2007 by Victoria Bay Asset Management and the American Stock Exchange and is listed on the NYSE Arca. Natural gas futures serve as the benchmark for natural gas prices in the United States. UNG is designed to give investors the convenience of commodity-like exposure without having a commodity futures account.</p>
