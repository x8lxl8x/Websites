<h1>Media Kit</h1>

<p>A package of information assembled by a company to provide basic information about itself to reporters. The media kit is a promotional public relations tool that can serve several functions, including promoting the launch of a new company, promoting the launch of a new product or service by an existing company, giving a company a way to present itself as it would like to be seen, and saving time by eliminating the need for a company's employees to repeatedly answer the same questions.</p>

<p>A media kit can be as simple as a page on a company's website or as complex as a package of information and product samples sent to selected members of the media that the company hopes will promote them. The media kit commonly provides the company's official name; the names, titles and biographies of its most important people; information about the company's history and function; photos; and any press releases the company has had written about itself. The media kit will also provide contact information for reporters who seek additional information or want to interview someone at the company.</p>
