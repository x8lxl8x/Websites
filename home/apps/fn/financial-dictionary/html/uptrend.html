<h1>Uptrend</h1>

<p>Describes the price movement of a financial asset when the overall direction is upward. A formal uptrend is when each successive peak and trough is higher than the ones found earlier in the trend.</p>

<p>Notice how each successive peak and trough is located above the previous ones. For example, the peak at Point 4 is higher than the peak at Point 2.  The uptrend will be deemed broken if the next low on the chart falls below Point 5.</p>

<p>Uptrend is the opposite of downtrend</p>

<p>The goal of most technical traders is to identify a strong uptrend and to profit from it until it reverses. Selling an asset once it has failed to create a new peak or trough is one of the best ways to avoid the large losses that can result from a reversed trend. Many technical traders will also draw trendlines to identify an uptrend and will use this tool as a guide for when to sell as it can also be an early indication of a trend reversal.</p>
