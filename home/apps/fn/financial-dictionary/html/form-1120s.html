<h1>Form 1120S</h1>

<p>A tax document used to report the income, losses and dividends of S corporation shareholders; it is an S corporation's tax return. Form 1120S is part of the Schedule K-1 document. It is prepared for each individual shareholder and identifies the percentage of company shares owned by the individual for the tax year.</p>

<p>For a partnership, Form 1065 is submitted instead of Form 1120S.</p>

<p>The IRS uses the ownership percentage to allocate how much profit and loss should be assigned to an individual shareholder. This is easily calculated if the shareholder doesn't see a change in the percentage during the year, but if shares are bought, sold or transfered during the course of the year then profit and loss has to be pro-rated on a per-share basis.</p>
