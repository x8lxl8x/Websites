<h1>IRS Publication 519 - U.S. Tax Guide For Aliens</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that details the tax procedures for aliens - individuals that are not citizens of the United States. Not all aliens are subject to U.S. taxes. Resident aliens, those who have been in the country for a defined period of time, are subject to taxation on their worldwide income just as citizens are. Non-resident aliens are only taxed on income earned within the United States, as well as on certain types of international income.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of IRS Publication 519 is its definition of a taxpayer's status as either a non-resident alien or a resident alien using the Substantial Presence Test, as the applicable tax rules are based on that status. Tax payers may also be considered as dual-resident aliens, and should also determine the tax status of any spouse.</p>
