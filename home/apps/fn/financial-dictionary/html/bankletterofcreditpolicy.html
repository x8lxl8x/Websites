<h1>Bank Letter Of Credit Policy</h1>

<p>An insurance policy that allows U.S. banks to confirm letters of credit issued by foreign financial institutions, facilitating the purchase of domestic exports. The policy was established by the Export-Import Bank of the United States and insures the domestic bank against the possible default of the foreign institution.</p>

<p>Remember, banks take on additional risk when dealing in overseas transactions. Political risk, such as warfare or government intervention, can wipe out a borrower's ability to reimburse the bank. Furthermore, in smaller, less stable nations, foreign exchange risk can be very large. The policy protects banks against any inconvertibility arising from foreign exchange issues.</p>
