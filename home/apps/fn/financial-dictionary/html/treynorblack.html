<h1>Treynor-Black Model</h1>

<p>A type of asset allocation model that was developed by Jack Treynor and Fischer Black. The model tries to determine the optimal combination of passively and actively managed assets in an investment portfolio.When determining the optimal allocation of assets, the model focuses primarily on securities' systematic and unsystematic risk.
If using the Treynor-Black model, an individual can see that the model focuses less on the Beta of a security and more on its unsystematic risk. The more unsystematic risk a security has, the less weight it is given in the Treynor-Black model. As a result of this tendency, the Treynor-Black model is said to favor low-return, low-risk securities over those with higher return and higher risk.           </p>
