<h1>Stuttgart Stock Exchange (STU) .SG </h1>

<p>Germany's second-largest securities market (after the Frankfurt Stock Exchange), the Stuttgart Stock Exchange (in German, BÃ¶erse Stuttgart) handles around 40% of all securities trades in the country. Established in 1860, the Exchange trades in equities, bonds, investment funds and participation certificates.</p>

<p>The Exchange closed from 1914-1919 due to World War I, and briefly during the Great Depression and World War II. In 2004, it became the first German stock exchange to limit commissions. By 2008, all asset classes were traded electronically. That same year, it traded around 400,000 securities and executed more than 1.5 million orders per month.</p>
