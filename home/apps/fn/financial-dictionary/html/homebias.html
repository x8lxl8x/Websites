<h1>Home Bias</h1>

<p>The tendency for investors to invest in a large amount of domestic equities, despite the purported benefits of diversifying into foreign equities. This bias is believed to have arisen as a result of the extra difficulties associated with investing in foreign equities, such as legal restrictions and additional transaction costs.</p>

<p>Investing in foreign equities tends to lower the amount of systematic risk in a portfolio because  foreign investments are less likely to be affected by domestic market changes.</p>

<p>However, investors from all over the world tend to be biased toward investing in domestic equities. For example, an academic study from the late 1980s showed that although Sweden possessed a capitalization that only represented about 1% of the world's market value of equities, Swedish investors put their money almost exclusively into domestic investments.</p>
