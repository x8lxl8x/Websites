<h1>Chief Financial Officer - CFO</h1>

<p>The senior manager responsible for overseeing the financial activities of an entire company. The CFO's duties include financial planning and monitoring cash flow. He or she analyzes the company's financial strengths and weaknesses and suggests plans for improvement. The CFO is similar to a treasurer or controller in that he or she is responsible for overseeing the accounting and finance departments and for ensuring that the company's financial reports are accurate and completed on time.</p>

<p>The CFO reports to the president, but has a major say in the company's capital structure, investments and how the company manages its income and expenses. The CFO works closely with other executives and plays a major role in any company's success, especially in the long run. Becoming a CFO requires extensive financial management experience as well as educational credentials in finance and/or accounting.</p>
