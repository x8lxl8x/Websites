<h1>Blow-Off Top</h1>

<p>A chart pattern that indicates a steep and rapid increase in a security's price and trading volume followed by a steep and rapid drop in price and volume. The rapid changes indicated by a blow-off top, also called a blow-off move or exhaustion move, can be the result of actual news or pure speculation.</p>

<p>A blow-off top usually indicates that a security's price is about to fall, while a blow-off bottom usually indicates that a security's price is about to rise. A security can enter a blow-off period during which its value remains inflated for weeks or months. Day traders who want to try to profit from blow-off periods, while limiting their losses from the price drops that inevitably follow a blow-off top, can use trailing stop techniques. Day traders also use blow-off tops to identify potential gap-n-go trades.</p>
