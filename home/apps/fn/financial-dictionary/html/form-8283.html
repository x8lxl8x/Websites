<h1>Form 8283</h1>

<p>A tax form distributed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and used by filers who wish to deduct noncash contributions made to a qualifying charitable organization. Deductions for noncash contributions are reported as itemized deductions. Noncash contributions can include securities, property, vehicles, collectibles or art.</p>

<p>Unlike donating cash, the donated noncash items may require an appraisal in order to determine value. Form 8283 requires a declaration by the appraising party indicating that the party is not the donor, donee, party to the transaction and does not have any conflict of interest that might influence the value at which an item is appraised.</p>
