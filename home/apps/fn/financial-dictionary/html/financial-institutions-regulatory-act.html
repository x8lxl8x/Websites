<h1>Financial Institutions Regulatory Act</h1>

<p>A United States Federal law enacted in 1978 pertaining to depository financial institutions. The act made 5 major changes to these institutions. The act created the Central Liquidity Facility and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), made electronic funds transfers federally regulated, changed the terms under which loans were provided to directors, officers, etc, as well as authorized cease and desist orders to be placed on them.</p>

<p>The FFIEC was formed to offer advice on how to regulate and create standards for depository financial institutions. The Central Liquidity Facility was formed to lend money to credit unions on a short-term basis to help them in times of need.</p>
