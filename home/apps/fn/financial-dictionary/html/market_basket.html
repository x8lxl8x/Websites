<h1>Market Basket</h1>

<p>A subset of products or securities that is designed to mimic the performance of an overall market. Market baskets contain a fixed selection of items, which are used to track such things as inflation, prices or performance levels.</p>

<p>For investors, the market basket is the principal idea behind index funds. A sample of stocks, bonds or other securities are placed in a portfolio that is expected to represent all aspects of the market. This provides investors with a benchmark against which to compare their investment returns.</p>

<p>Another popular market basket relates to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks a variety of consumer goods. The CPI looks at the price levels of consumer products and provides an estimate for inflation.</p>
