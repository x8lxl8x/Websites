<h1>Current Price</h1>

<p>The "real time" price of a security trading on an exchange, as well as the most recent price of a security listed in an investment portfolio. In the case of a bond, a bond's current price will often be quoted as 10% of the par value of $1000.00. A bond that currently trades at $99 is really priced at $990.00.  Current price also refers to the present price of a stock, currency, commodity, stamps or a precious metal.</p>

<p>Current price is the market value or the price at which goods are currently being sold in the market. Similar to market price, which is the price determined by buyers and sellers in an open market, the current price of a security is the price at which at a security is presently traded.</p>
