<h1>Medicare Doughnut Hole</h1>

<p>A range of total prescription drug spending in the Medicare Part D program where all of the costs must be covered out-of-pocket. As a result of the Medicare doughnut hole, Medicare Part D participants are forced to choose between paying higher insurance premiums, or potentially paying thousands of dollars out-of-pocket to bridge the coverage gap. Many lower-income participants in Medicare are unable to afford either option.</p>

<p>While supplemental plans exist which offer some amount coverage through the doughnut hole range, they are significantly more expensive that the standard plans.</p>

<p>For 2009, the coverage gap was between the initial coverage amounts up to $2,700 of total drug spending and the catastrophic coverage level which provides coverage when total drug spending reaches over $6,154 per year. Therefore, if total drug spending was between $2,700 and $6,154 the amount would have to paid out of pocket.</p>
