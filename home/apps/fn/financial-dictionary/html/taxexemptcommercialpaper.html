<h1>Tax-Exempt Commercial Paper</h1>

<p>An unsecured short-term loan, usually issued to finance short-term liabilities, that provides the debt holders (bondholders) some level of tax preference on the earnings from their debt investment at a local, state or federal level, or a combination thereof.</p>

<p>Universities often issue tax-exempt commercial papers to finance their operations with the help of the government. Governments help universities finance their operations because it is beneficial for the population to have post-secondary education. Although governments do not necessarily provide the universities with cash injections, they allow them to issue commercial papers that can earn tax-exempt gains for the people who buy them.</p>
