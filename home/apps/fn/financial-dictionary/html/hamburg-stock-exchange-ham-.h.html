<h1>Hamburg Stock Exchange (HAM) .H</h1>

<p>This now-defunct exchange was located in Hamburg, Germany. It traded stocks, bonds and other securities and was a financial pillar of the city. It offered investment plans such as FONDS-X that impacted both open and closed-end funds.</p>

<p>The HAM was the oldest stock exchange in Germany, founded in 1558. The Hamburg Stock Exchange merged with the Hanover Stock Exchange in 1999 to form the BOAG Borgen AG. However, the Frankfurt exchange has made this new entity virtually obsolete. The former exchange ran from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM.</p>
