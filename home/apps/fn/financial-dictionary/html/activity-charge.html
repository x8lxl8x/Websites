<h1>Activity Charge</h1>

<p>A fee charged to cover the servicing costs of an account. An activity charge is triggered by an activity or event, and should follow a fee schedule outlined in the account contract. These fees can be based on teller and non-teller activities.</p>

<p>Activity charges can be all encompassing; for example, a monthly service charge on a checking account may cover a certain number of transactional items. A different account may charge only per-item fees, such as a fee for each check written or each account withdrawal. A very common activity charge is the service charge for an automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawal at a bank other than your own.</p>
