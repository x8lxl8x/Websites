<h1>Foreign Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund, closed-end fund or exchange-traded fund that invests in companies located outside of the investor's country of residence.</p>

<p>Also known as an "international fund."</p>

<p>Foreign funds offer individual investors access to international markets. Investing abroad poses risks, but can also help investors diversify their portfolios.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize the difference between global funds and foreign funds. Global funds can invest in securities from any country, including the investor's home country.</p>
