<h1>Consumer And Business Lending Initiative</h1>

<p>A plan initiated to aid in the government's goal of correcting the credit crisis by working on the secondary lending markets. Execution of the plan means extensive lending and reorganization of TALF.</p>

<p>Without an effective secondary lending market, a large strain is placed on the major commercial banks, as the two lending mediums work hand in hand. Banks often combine their loans and sell them to the secondary markets, which keeps money flowing freely in the banks allowing them to continue to distribute both personal and business loans. Therefore, without the secondary markets, the lending from commercial banks dries up.</p>
