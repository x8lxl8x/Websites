<h1>Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey - CLIPS</h1>

<p>An annual survey from the consulting firm Towers Perrin that reveals commercial insurance pricing trends. It tracks prices charged by over 30 insurance carriers for underwriting business casualty and property insurance policies. The survey can be used to track year-over-year variations in policy prices. CLIPS is considered an industry-leading survey and benchmarking tool.</p>

<p>Commercial property insurance covers potential financial loss due to damage, theft or loss of real or personal property. Casualty insurance provides financial coverage for the actual business itself. For example, if a business was unable to open because of damage caused by fire, the property insurance would apply to the physical building while the casualty insurance would help compensate for the financial loss created by the interruption in work. Casualty insurance options have grown since the 1990s to include coverage for business interruption due to terrorism, government instability, cyber fraud and identity theft. The variation in policy premiums compose the premise of CLIPS.</p>
