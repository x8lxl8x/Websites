<h1>Benefit Period</h1>

<p>The benefit period is the length of time during which a benefit is paid. This can involve a government benefit program such as Medicare, or payment from an insurance policy, such as health or disability insurance. The benefit period is defined in each program or policy's guidelines.</p>

<p>The benefit period can vary from policy to policy. For example, the benefit period in the context of Medicare begins the day an insured is admitted to a hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF), and ends when the insured has not received any care for 60 days in a row.</p>
