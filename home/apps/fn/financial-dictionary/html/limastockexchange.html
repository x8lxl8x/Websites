<h1>Lima Stock Exchange (LMA) .LM</h1>

<p>The major securities exchange market in Peru, the Lima Stock Exchange (in Spanish, the Bolsa de Valores de Lima) began operations in 1861 but did not trade in any type of stocks for the first 30 years. The Exchange was re-launched in 1898. Business is conducted both on a trading floor and through an electroncic system that was established in 1995.</p>

<p>The functions of the Lima Stock Exchange include informing members on purchases and sales, impartially executing trade instructions, registering securities, promoting securities trading, keeping the general public informed about stock values, investigating potential new products, and more. Its value-weighted IGBVL index, the general index of the Lima Stock Exchange, tracks the Exchange's largest and most actively traded stocks.</p>
