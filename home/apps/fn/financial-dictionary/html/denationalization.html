<h1>Denationalization</h1>

<p>The act of changing a government-run firm into a private-sector firm. In order to accomplish this transition, the government must either sell or otherwise redistribute the formerly government-run firm in a way that is equitable to citizens.</p>

<p>Denationalization is also known as "privatization".</p>

<p>A recent example of denationalization can be found in the formerly government-owned Japan Post Group. This group of companies provided postal services, banking and insurance products in Japan. However, the group was unable to turn a profit under government management. As part of an ongoing campaign to cut government spending, the Japan Post Group was denationalized by the Japanese government.</p>
