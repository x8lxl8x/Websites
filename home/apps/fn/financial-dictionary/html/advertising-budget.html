<h1>Advertising Budget</h1>

<p>An estimation of a company's promotional expenditures over a period of time. An advertising budget is the money a company is willing to set aside to accomplish its marketing objectives. When creating the advertising budget, a company must weigh the trade-offs between spending one additional advertising dollar with the amount of revenue that dollar will bring in as revenue.</p>

<p>Companies can determine what level to set their advertising budget several different ways, each of which has its positives and negatives. A business can set its budget as a percentage of sales, at the same level as its competitors, as the amount required to meet a certain objective, as the entirety of its profits or as a function of the units of product it wants to sell among others.</p>
