<h1>Swing High</h1>

<p>A term used in technical analysis that refers to the peak reached by an indicator or an asset's price. A swing high is formed when the high of a price is greater than a given number of highs positioned around it. A series of consecutively higher swing highs indicates that the given asset is in an uptrend.</p>

<p>Swing highs can be used by traders to identify possible areas of support and resistance, which can then be used to determine optimal positions for stop-loss orders. If an indicator fails to create a new swing high while the price of the security does reach a new high, there is a  divergence between price and indicator, which could be a signal that the trend is reversing.</p>
