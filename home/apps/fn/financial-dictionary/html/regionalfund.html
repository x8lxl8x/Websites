<h1>Regional Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that confines itself to investments in securities from a specified geographical area, such as Latin America, Europe or Asia. A regional mutual fund will generally look to own a diversified portfolio of companies based in and operating out of its specified geographical area. However, some regional funds can also be set up to invest in a specific segment of the region's economy, such as energy.</p>

<p>For the investor, the primary benefit of a regional fund is that he/she increases his/her diversification by being exposed to a specific foreign geographical area. These funds are practical for the average investor, since most people wouldn't have enough capital to adequately diversify themselves across many investments in the region.</p>

<p>Regional funds select securities that pass geographical criteria. They are not to be confused with other mutual funds such as international funds, which attempt to provide investors with a diversified portfolio spanning the globe, or country funds, which provide investors with diversified exposure to companies in one specific nation.          </p>
