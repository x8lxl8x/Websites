<h1>Taxable Municipal Bond</h1>

<p>A fixed-income security issued by a local government such as a city or county or related agencies, the income from which is not exempt from tax. Taxable municipal bonds are generally issued to finance a project or activity that does not provide a major benefit to the public. In such cases, the federal government will not permit the tax-exemption that is a prominent feature of most municipal bonds.</p>

<p>Most municipal bonds are tax exempt. Since income from such non tax exempt bonds is taxable in the hands of the investor, they offer risk-adjusted yields that are comparable to those available from other taxable entities such as corporate bonds, rather than tax-exempt munis.</p>

<p>Examples of situations where taxable municipal bonds may be issued include financing local sports facilities or funding an under-funded municipal pension plan. Build America Bonds (BABs) are an example of taxable municipal bonds; they were created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and, although taxable, have special tax credits and federal subsidies for either the bond issuer or holder.</p>
