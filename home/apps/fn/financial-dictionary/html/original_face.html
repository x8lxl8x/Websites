<h1>Original Face</h1>

<p>The par value of a mortgage-backed security at the time it is issued. Unlike most other types of bonds, mortgage-backed securities return both principal and interest to the holder in periodic payments (usually monthly). Over time, the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage-backed security will be reduced. The original face remains an important and distinguishing piece of information associated with a mortgage-backed security.</p>

<p>By definition, a new issue mortgage-backed security will have a pool factor of 1; in other words, the original face will equal the current face. As the principal is paid down, the current face will be less than the original face.</p>

<p>The current face is derived by multiplying the original face by the current pool factor.</p>
