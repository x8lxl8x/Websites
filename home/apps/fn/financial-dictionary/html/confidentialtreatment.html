<h1>Confidential Treatment Application</h1>

<p>A form filled out in accordance with a company's 8-K, 10-Q, or 10-K report. It allows for information in the SEC filing to be kept secret, if leaking such information could cause material or financial harm to the company or a business partner.</p>

<p>For example, specific pricing information in company contracts with clients may qualify for confidential treatment. This is because exposing such information would most likely hurt a company's financial performance as competitors can use this information to undercut the company.</p>

<p>These requests are not usually granted by the SEC at will, but in certain instances it can be deemed in the best interest of the company and investors to keep the information confidential for a certain period of time.</p>
