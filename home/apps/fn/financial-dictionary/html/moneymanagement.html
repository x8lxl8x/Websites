<h1>Money Management</h1>

<p>The process of budgeting, saving, investing, spending or otherwise in overseeing the cash usage of an individual or group. The predominant use of the phrase in financial markets is that of an investment professional making investment decisions for large pools of funds, such as mutual funds or pension plans.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "investment management" and/or "portfolio management".</p>

<p>While the term is usually used in reference to professional money managers, everyone practices some form of investment management with their personal finances. There are a wide range of money management services, from the operation of passively-managed mutual funds with low fees to in-depth estate planning and consulting.</p>
