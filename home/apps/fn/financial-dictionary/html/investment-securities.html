<h1>Investment Securities</h1>

<p>Securities that are purchased in order to be held for investment. This is in contrast to securities that are purchased by a broker-dealer or other intermediary for resale. Banks often purchase marketable securities to hold in their portfolios.</p>

<p>Investment securities held by banks are usually one of two main sources of revenue, along with loans. Investment securities provide banks with a source of liquidity along with the profits from realized capital gains when they are sold.</p>
