<h1>Firm Order</h1>

<p>1. A market order to buy or sell a security for a brokerage's proprietary account. A firm order requires a trader to be fully authorized by the brokerage before executing the transaction.</p>

<p>2. A buy or sell order executed by a broker for a client's account. This is not contingent on the customer's confirmation.</p>

<p>1. A firm order is made for the brokerage's equity portfolio and is held in the firm's trading account. Shares purchased under a firm order are held directly by the brokerage.</p>

<p>2. Full trading authorization is typically required for a broker to execute a transaction on behalf of a client without first confirming the order. This type of trade allows a client to benefit from any timely knowledge the broker may have.</p>
