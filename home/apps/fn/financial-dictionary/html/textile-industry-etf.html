<h1>Textile Industry ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that invests in textile manufacturers. An ETF dedicated solely to textiles does not exist as of 2010. This may be due to a number of reasons including little investor interest, the lack of an investable textile index and the fact that most textile manufacturers are relatively smaller companies based in Asia.</p>

<p>There are very few ways to invest in the textile industry through an ETF. One alternative is to invest in cotton, which is a key input in many textile products including denim and terrycloth. There are a few ETFs and ETNs traded in the U.S. that focus on soft commodities and have a significant weight in cotton.</p>
