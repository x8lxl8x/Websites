<h1>Credit Limit</h1>

<p>The amount of credit that a financial institution extends to a client. Credit limit also refers to the maximum amount a credit card company will allow someone to borrow on a single card. Credit limits are usually determined based on information contained in the application of the person seeking credit, or that person's credit rating.</p>

<p>A borrower's credit limit may be raised after he or she exhibits timely and full repayments.  However, having a high credit limit and multiple lines of credit may hurt a person's overall credit rating.  In these cases, new potential lenders can see that the applicant has access to a large amount of debt, which may lower the chances that this person will be able to repay his or her debts in the future. As a result, new potential lenders might be less likely to offer an additional source of debt.</p>
