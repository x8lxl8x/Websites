<h1>Private Foundation</h1>

<p>A charitable organization that, while serving a good cause, does not qualify as a public charity by government standards. A private foundation is a nonprofit organization which is usually created via a single primary donation from an individual or a business and whose funds and programs are managed by its own trustees or directors. As such, rather than funding its ongoing operations through periodic donations, a private foundation generates income by investing its initial donation, often disbursing the bulk of its investment income each year to desired charitable activities.</p>

<p>Private foundations generally fit into two categories: private operating foundations and private non-operating foundations. Private operating foundations actually run the charitable activities or organizations they fund with their investment income, while private non-operating foundations simply disburse funds to other charitable organizations.</p>
