<h1>Revaluation Rates</h1>

<p>Market currency rates from a specific point in time that are used as a base value by currency traders to assess whether a profit or a loss has been realized for the day. In most cases, the revaluation rate is the closing rate for the previous trading day.</p>

<p>For example, in order to assess how much profit a currency trader made today, he or she would use yesterday's closing rate (today's revaluation rate) of 1.15 USD/CAD as a baseline for comparing today's closing rate of 1.145 USD/CAD. If the trader shorts the U.S. dollar in early trading and then buys it back at the end of the day, he or she will make $0.005 for every U.S. dollar traded.</p>
