<h1>Backwardation</h1>

<p>A theory developed in respect to the price of a futures contract and the contract's time to expire. Backwardation says that as the contract approaches expiration, the futures contract will trade at a higher price compared to when the contract was further away from expiration. This is said to occur due to the convenience yield being higher than the prevailing risk free rate.</p>

<p>When backwardation does occur in a futures market it has been suggested that an individual in the short position would benefit the most by delivering as late as possible.</p>

<p>Backwardation in futures contracts was called "normal backwardation" by economist John Maynard Keynes. This is because he believed that a price movement like the one suggested by backwardation was not random but consistent with the prevailing market conditions.</p>

<p>Backwardation is the opposite of contango.</p>
