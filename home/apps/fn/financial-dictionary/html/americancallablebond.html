<h1>American Callable Bond</h1>

<p>A bond that can be redeemed by the issuer at any time prior to its maturity. Usually a premium is paid to the bondholder when the bond is called.</p>

<p>The main cause of a call is a decline in interest rates since the first date of issue. The issuer would likely call the current bonds and distribute new bonds at a lower interest rate. Unfortunately, these types of bonds pose considerable interest rate risk to bondholders. Also, since the issuer can call the bond at any time before maturity, there is also uncertainty as to when the call (and corresponding interest rate exposure) will occur.</p>
