<h1>Activities, Interests And Opinions - AIO</h1>

<p>A person's characteristics used by market researchers to construct the individual's psychographic profile. An individual's activities, interests and opinions are typically unearthed by researchers through their responses to statements or questions in a survey. The most common applications of AIO are in market segmentation and advertising, where they help in focusing a company's marketing and promotional efforts to its target audience.</p>

<p>In a typical AIO survey, a researcher will ask the respondent to indicate their degree of agreement or disagreement with a number of statements pertaining to his or her lifestyle, entertainment choices, fashion preferences and so on. AIO data are particularly useful when used in conjunction with other data, such as demographics, rather than in isolation.</p>
