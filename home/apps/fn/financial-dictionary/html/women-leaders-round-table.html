<h1>Women Leaders Round Table - WLRT</h1>

<p>The first recorded organization for women in the insurance industry. The Women Leaders Round Table was founded in 1936, and met annually to recognize female leaders in insurance sales. Membership was based solely on meeting certain production thresholds. The organization later dissolved because so many of the members qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table, becoming instead the Women Life Underwriters Conference (WLUC). WLUC was formed in 1979 to broaden the women agents' perspective in the insurance industry.</p>

<p>In 2000, the Women Life Underwriters Conference was replaced by the acronym WIFS, standing for Women in Insurance & Financial Services. By 2010, WIFS had grown to over 1,200 members with 30 local chapters, with an emphasis on membership, education, and corporate and public initiatives. It celebrated its 75th anniversary as an organization in 2011.</p>
