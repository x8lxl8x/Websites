<h1>Negative Points</h1>

<p>A cash rebate paid by lenders to a mortgage broker or the borrower for a mortgage with an interest rate above the lender's par interest rate. When the rebate is paid to the mortgage broker, it is known as a yield spread premium, and is part of the mortgage broker's compensation.</p>

<p>When the rebate is credited to the borrower it can be used to defray loan settlement costs. This is typically known as a no-cost mortgage. The amount credited to the borrower may not exceed loan settlement costs, and may not be used as part of the down payment.</p>

<p>Negative points provide a way for borrowers with little or no money to pay the settlement costs and obtain a mortgage. However, the true economics of using negative points will depend on the borrower's time horizon.</p>

<p>If the borrower intends to hold the mortgage for a short period of time, it can be economical to avoid upfront costs in exchange for a relatively higher interest rate. If the borrower intends to hold the mortgage for a long period of time, it is most likely more economical to pay upfront settlement costs in exchange for a relatively lower interest rate.</p>
