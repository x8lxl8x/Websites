<h1>Cum Laude</h1>

<p>An academic level of distinction used by educational institutions to signify an academic degree which was received "with honor". Cum laude is one of three commonly used types of Latin honors which are recognized in the United States, the other two being summa cum laude and magna cum laude.</p>

<p>The guidelines by which each level of academic honors is acheived differs between academic institutions, however every university or college will outline their expectations for each program. Although Latin honors are quite common in the United States, very few countries around the world use the Latin system.</p>
