<h1>International Portfolio</h1>

<p>A grouping of investment assets that focuses on securities from foreign markets rather than domestic ones. An international portfolio is designed to give the investor exposure to growth in emerging and international markets and provide diversification.</p>

<p>International portfolios allow investors to further diversify their assets by moving away from a domestic-only portfolio. This type of portfolio can carry increased risk due to potential economic instability stemming from emerging markets, but can also bring increased stability through investments in industrialized and more stable markets.</p>

<p>Due to the integration of global financial markets, many companies already have operations in more than one country.</p>
