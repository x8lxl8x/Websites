<h1>Form 8282: Donee Information Return</h1>

<p>An IRS tax form used by organizations to report the sale or disposition of donated property to the IRS and to donors. Form 8282 is used by the original and successor organizations that received a piece of property if the property is disposed of within three years of the original donation.</p>

<p>If the property in question is worth less than $500 or if it is disposed of in order to fulfill the purpose of the charitable organization (e.g. school supplies distributed by an education-related charity), then the organization may not have to file Form 8282.</p>

<p>The original organization that received the property must provide the successive organization (the one receiving the property) with a copy of Form 8283, which was signed by the donor at the time of the donation to the original organization, as well as a copy of Form 8282 within 15 days of the disposition. The successor organization must provide the original organization with a document outlining the date the transfer of property was received. The original donor must be provided with a copy of Form 8282.</p>

<p>If an organization disposes of a motor vehicle, boat or airplane, it should refer to IRS Publication 526 for more information.</p>
