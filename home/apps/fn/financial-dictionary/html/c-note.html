<h1>C-Note</h1>

<p>A slang term for a one hundred dollar banknote. The "C" in C-note refers to the Roman numeral for 100, which was printed on $100 bills. "C" can also refer to century.</p>

<p>The term came to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s, and was popularized in a number of gangster films. C-note is used less frequently in modern slang, and has been replaced by "Benjamin" as Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States, is on the $100 banknote.</p>
