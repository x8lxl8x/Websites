<h1>Convertible Bond Arbitrage</h1>

<p>An arbitrage strategy that aims to capitalize on mispricing between a convertible bond and its underlying stock. The strategy is generally market neutral; in other words, the arbitrageur seeks to generate consistent returns with minimal volatility regardless of market direction through a combination of long and short positions in the convertible bond and underlying stock.</p>

<p>If the convertible bond is cheap or undervalued relative to the underlying stock, the arbitrageur will take a long position in the convertible bond and a simultaneous short position in the stock. Conversely, if the convertible bond is overpriced relative to the underlying stock, the arbitrageur will take a short position in the convertible bond and a simultaneous long position in the underlying stock.</p>

<p>The price of a convertible bond is especially sensitive to changes in interest rates, the price of the underlying stock, and the issuer's credit rating. Therefore, another type of convertible bond arbitrage involves buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors so as to get exposure to the third factor at an attractive price.</p>
