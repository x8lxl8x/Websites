<h1>Macro Environment</h1>

<p>The conditions that exist in the economy as a whole, rather than in a particular sector or region. In general, the macro environment will include trends in gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, employment, spending, and monetary and fiscal policy. The macro environment is closely linked to the general business cycle, as opposed to the performance of an individual business sector.</p>

<p>The macro environment in which a company or sector operates will influence its performance, and the amount of the influence will depend on how much of the company's business is dependent on the health of the overall economy. Cyclical industries, for example, are heavily influenced by the macro environment, while consumer staples are less so.</p>
