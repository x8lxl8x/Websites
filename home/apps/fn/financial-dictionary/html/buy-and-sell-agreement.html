<h1>Buy And Sell Agreement</h1>

<p>An approach used by sole proprietorships, partnerships and closed corporations to divide the business share or interest of a proprietor, partner, or shareholder. The owner of the business interest being considered has to be disabled, deceased, retired or expressed interest in selling. The buy and sell agreement requires that the business share is sold according to a predetermined formula to the company or the remaining members of the business. Before the interest of a deceased partner can be sold to the company or remaining partners, the deceased's estate must agree to sell.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the availability of funds in the event of a partner's death, most parties will purchase life insurance policies on the other partners. In the event of a death, the proceeds from the life insurance policy are used to purchase a portion of the deceased's business interest.  It is important to note that when a sole proprietor dies, since he/she has no partners, a key employee is the buyer or successor.</p>
