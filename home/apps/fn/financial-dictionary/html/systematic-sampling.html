<h1>Systematic Sampling</h1>

<p>A method of selecting sample members from a larger population according to a random starting point and a fixed, periodic interval. Typically, every "nth" member is selected from the total population for inclusion in the sample population. Systematic sampling is still thought of as being random, as long as the periodic interval is determined beforehand and the starting point is random.</p>

<p>A common way of selecting members for a sample population using systematic sampling is simply to divide the total number of units in the general population by the desired number of units for the sample population. The result of the division serves as the marker for selecting sample units from within the general population.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to select a random group of 1,000 people from a population of 50,000 using systematic sampling, you would simply select every 50th person, since 50,000/1,000 = 50.</p>
