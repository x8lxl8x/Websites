<h1>Tipping</h1>

<p>The act of providing material non-public information about a publicly-traded company to a person who is not authorized to have the information. This is an illegal act. Information is considered non-public until it has been publicly released and the financial markets have had sufficient time to digest the impact the information may have had on prices.</p>

<p>Investment bankers are often in possession of material non-public information that can be used for tipping, although occurrences of tipping are very rare. In the event that a person unknowingly passes on a tip, he or she may still have performed a criminal act by being careless with the information.</p>

<p>Tips can be used to make insider trades before the information becomes available to the public. The law prohibits tippees, or those who receive material non-public information, from making financial transactions based on the information they have received.</p>
