<h1>Tide</h1>

<p>A metaphor for a long-term market trend. The tide would refer to trends in the market that have long term affects, rather than short term changes that may reverse in a short period. Issues such as inflation, high unemployment and/or high interest rates, would affect an economy's tide.</p>

<p>The ocean metaphors for market trends were coined by one of the market's first technical analysts, Robert Rhea.</p>

<p>Tides are often referred to in the context of triple screen trading. Using this system, a trader uses a longer-term chart, or market tide, as the basis for trading decisions. For instance, if a trader plans to trade daily he or she would examine the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, as its slope provides indication of the market tide.</p>
