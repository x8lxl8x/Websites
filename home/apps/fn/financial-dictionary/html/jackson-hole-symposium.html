<h1>Jackson Hole Economic Symposium</h1>

<p>An annual symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1978, and held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, since 1981. The symposium focuses on an important economic issue that faces U.S. and world economies. Participants include prominent central bankers and finance ministers, as well as academic luminaries and leading financial market players from around the world.
The Symposium proceedings are closely followed by market participants, as unexpected remarks emanating from the heavyweights at the Symposium have the potential to affect global stock and currency markets.</p>

<p>The topic for the 2010 Symposium was "Macroeconomic Challenges: The Decade Ahead." Speakers included Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, and Kansas City Fed President Tom Hoenig.</p>
