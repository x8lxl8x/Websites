<h1>Minimum Deposit</h1>

<p>The smallest amount of money that an investor/trader must initially deposit into a new brokerage account. Minimum deposits are required to cover the baseline costs associated with setting up a new account and maintaining it thereafter.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "Minimum to Open an Account."</p>

<p>Depending on the purpose of the account, minimum deposit amounts can range anywhere from $0 to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most large, well-known companies will offer some form of investment account that can be started with a modest amount between $500 and $2,000 for a retail investor.</p>

<p>Minimum deposit levels are also found with certificates of deposit (CDs) at a banking institution, or retirement accounts such as IRAs.</p>
