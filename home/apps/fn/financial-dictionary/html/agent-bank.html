<h1>Agent Bank </h1>

<p>A bank that acts in some capacity on behalf of another bank. It can mean any of three types of bank:
(1) The bank in a loan syndicate that advises other participating banks of advances taken and changes in interest rates for a foreign or domestic borrower
(2) A bank that participates in the credit card program of another bank by issuing credit cards and performing other duties (excluding financing card receivables)
(3) A foreign bank doing business in the U.S. on behalf of its parent bank, performing such tasks as issuing international letters of credit, but not accepting deposits</p>

<p>Also known as an "agency bank."</p>

<p>A syndicate manager will receive a mandate from a borrower to arrange a syndicated loan. After the agreement closes, the duties of the syndicate manager end. At that point, the syndicate manager is usually appointed the agent bank, which coordinates the loan between the borrower and participating banks.</p>
