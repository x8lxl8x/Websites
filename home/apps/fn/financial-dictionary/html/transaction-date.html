<h1>Transaction Date</h1>

<p>The date upon which a security or other financial instrument is traded. The transaction date represents the time at which ownership is transferred. In banking, the date a transaction appears in the account is also referred to as the transaction date, although it is not necessarily the date on which the bank clears the transaction and deposits or withdraws funds.</p>

<p>The transaction date is not necessarily the same as the settlement date, which can happen several days after the transaction occurs. The seller is paid upon settlement because all of the details about the transaction have been finalized, and because the buyer is certain that what has been promised has actually been delivered.</p>
