<h1>Daily Chart</h1>

<p>A line graph that displays the intraday movements of a given security. This contrasts to longer term charts, such as those that show a security's movement over a period of days, months or even years.</p>

<p>Daily charts display all of the price movement for the period and are typically used by day traders to implement short-term strategies.</p>

<p>Because the forex operates 24 hours a day, there is technically no stoppage of trading between one trading day and the next as there is in other markets. As a result, the convention is to consider a forex day to be from 5pm EST to the same time on the following day, and most daily charts are displayed this way.</p>
