<h1>Last Will And Testament</h1>

<p>A legal document that communicates a person's final wishes, as pertaining to possessions and dependents. A person's last will and testament will outline what to do with possessions, whether they are being left to another person, group or donated to charity, and what will happen to other things for which they are responsible, such as custody of dependents and accounts and interests management.</p>

<p>A will is written while a person is alive and carried out once they've passed away. In the will, a still-living person is named as the executor of the estate, and that person is responsible for administering the estate and is usually supervised by the probate court to ensure that what is specified in the will is carried out.</p>
