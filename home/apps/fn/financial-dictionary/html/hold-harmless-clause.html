<h1>Hold Harmless Clause</h1>

<p>A statement in a legal contract stating that an individual or organization is not liable for any injuries or damages caused to the individual signing the contract. An individual may be asked to sign a hold harmless agreement when undertaking an activity that involves risk for which the enabling entity does not want to be legally or financially responsible.</p>

<p>Also known as <i>hold harmless provision.</i></p>

<p>For example, a sports club may include a hold harmless clause in its contract to prevent its members from suing if they are injured in the course of participating in a tennis match. In this example, the hold harmless clause would ask the participant to accept all risks associated with the activity, including the risks of injury or death.</p>
