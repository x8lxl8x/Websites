<h1>Medicare</h1>

<p>A U.S. federal health program that subsidizes people who meet one of the following criteria:</p>

<p>1. An individual over the age of 65 who has been a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident for five years.</p>

<p>2. An individual who is disabled and has collected Social Security for a minimum of two years.</p>

<p>3. An individual who is undergoing dialysis for kidney failure or who is in need of a kidney transplant.</p>

<p>4. An individual who has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease).</p>

<p>Medicare helps out people at a time in their lives when they may have serious health problems but lack the funding for treatment.</p>

<p>Medicare is divided into two parts. The first part of the coverage encompasses in-patient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice care. The second part of coverage encompasses almost all the necessary medical services (doctors' services, laboratory and x-ray services, wheelchairs, etc).</p>
