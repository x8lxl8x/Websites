<h1>ECN Broker</h1>

<p>A forex financial expert who uses electronic communications networks (ECNs) to provide its clients direct access to other participants in the currency markets. Because an ECN broker consolidates price quotations from several market participants, it can generally offer its clients tighter bid/ask spreads than would be otherwise available to them.</p>

<p>Since an ECN broker only matches trades between market participants, it cannot trade against the client, an allegation often directed against some unscrupulous retail forex brokers. Because ECN spreads are much narrower than those used by everyday brokers, electronic communication networks brokers charge clients a fixed commission per transaction.</p>
