<h1>Rental Real Estate Loss Allowance</h1>

<p>A federal tax deduction of up to $25,000 that is available to non-real estate professionals who own at least a 10% interest in a rental property that they actively manage and that operates at a loss during a particular tax year. Under the tax code, losses from passive activities such as rental real estate ownership normally cannot be deducted from income; the rental real estate loss allowance provides an exception to that rule.</p>

<p>To meet the active participation test, the taxpayer must make management decisions for the property. It is possible to meet this test even if the rental property is run by a management company.
As of 2009, the full deduction is available to single taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $100,000; between $100,000 and $150,000 the deduction gradually phases out, and taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $150,000 may not take the deduction at all.</p>
