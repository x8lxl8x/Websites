<h1>Secured Creditor</h1>

<p>Any creditor or lender that takes collateral for the extension of credit, loan or bond issuance. In the arena of personal finance, the most well-known secured creditors are mortgage lenders whose loans are secured either by a first or second lien on a property.</p>

<p>Secured creditors have the most senior protection in bankruptcy, since they have specific assets that collateralize their loans. Secured creditors also generally have the right to repossess or foreclose on the property against which a lien is held when the borrower is in default.</p>
