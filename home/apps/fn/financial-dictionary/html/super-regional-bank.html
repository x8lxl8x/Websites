<h1>Super Regional Bank</h1>

<p>A mid-sized bank that has a significant presence in a geographical region across multiple states. A super regional bank is smaller than the large national or global banks, but it is much bigger than regional banks. Super regional banks generally offer the complete range of banking services from deposits and loans, to securities brokerage, investment banking and fund management.</p>

<p>Size alone is not enough of a criteria to determine if a bank can be considered super regional. Super regional American banks include U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon, PNC Financial Services Group and BB&T Corp. Some super regional banks have grown over the years by acquiring their smaller rivals. Some regional banks could become super regional by acquiring deposits or branches and expanding across state lines.</p>
