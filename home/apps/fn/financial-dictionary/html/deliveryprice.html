<h1>Delivery Price</h1>

<p>The financial value of the conveyance of the underlying commodities when a futures or forward contract expires. The delivery price is the price at which one party agrees to deliver the underlying commodity and at which the counterparty agrees to accept delivery. Delivery price can also refer to a stock's selling price in options contracts. Delivery prices are set by clearinghouses.</p>

<p>In forward contracts, the forward price and the delivery price are identical when the contract begins, but as time passes, the forward price will fluctuate and the delivery price will remain constant. Also, underlying assets typically are not actually delivered, but rather closed out with offsetting contracts. Another possibility is that a delivery instrument representing the underlying asset, such as a warehouse receipt, will be transferred instead of the actual commodity. If the commodity is physically delivered, the cost of delivery will affect the contract's delivery price.</p>
