<h1>N</h1>

<p>A Nasdaq stock symbol specifying that it is the company's third class of preferred shares. The N in the stock quote will be the fifth letter in the string, thus identifying that the share is not a common share, but rather a preferred share of the third class. On the Nasdaq exchange, N specifically identifies the issue as something other than a single issue of common stock or capital stock.</p>

<p>Preferred stock ownership in a corporation usually has a higher claim on the assets and earnings than common stock. Preferred stock generally has a dividend that must be paid out before dividends to common stockholders. Shareholders of preferred shares often prefer this class of shares due to its higher ranking in the "waterfall" of corporate distributions.</p>
