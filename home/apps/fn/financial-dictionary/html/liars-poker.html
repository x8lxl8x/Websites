<h1>Liar's Poker</h1>

<p>A game often associated with Wall Street traders who use statistical reasoning and behavioral psychology tactics to gamble. Liar's Poker is fairly similar to the card game "cheat." Players hold random dollar bills with close attention to their own bill serial number. The objective of the game is to bluff the opponents into believing that your bid does not exceed the combined sum of all of the serial numbers.</p>

<p><i>Liar's Poker</i> is also book by Michael Lewis that depicts the Wall Street bond trading culture at Salomon Brother's.</p>

<p>In <i>Liar's Poker</i>, if one player bids three 4s, he predicts that within all of the dollar serial numbers held by all players, there are at least three 4s. If the player's bluff is not called, the next player must either bid a higher frequency of any other digit (five 2s) or can bid a higher number at the same frequency level (three 6s).</p>
