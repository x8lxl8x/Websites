<h1>Adjustable Peg</h1>

<p>An exchange rate policy adopted by some countries wherein the national currency is largely pegged or fixed to a major currency such as the U.S. dollar or euro, but can be readjusted from time to time within a narrow interval. The periodic adjustments can are usually intended to improve the country's competitive position in the export market.</p>

<p>Following the adoption of the Bretton Woods system in 1944, most Western European nations pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar, until 1971.</p>

<p>The Chinese renminbi or yuan was informally pegged to the US dollar in the mid-1990s until 2005 at a rate of approximately 8.28 per dollar. The peg was adjusted to about 6.83 yuan per U.S. dollar from July 2008, after three years of appreciation.</p>
