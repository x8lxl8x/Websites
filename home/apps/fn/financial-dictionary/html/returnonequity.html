<h1>Return On Equity - ROE</h1>

<p>The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.</p>

<p>ROE is expressed as a percentage and calculated as:</p>

<p><b>Return on Equity = Net Income/Shareholder's Equity</b></p>

<p>Net income is for the full fiscal year (before dividends paid to common stock holders but after dividends to preferred stock.) Shareholder's equity does not include preferred shares.</p>

<p>Also known as "return on net worth" (RONW).</p>

<p>The ROE is useful for comparing the profitability of a company to that of other firms in the same industry.</p>

<p>There are several variations on the formula that investors may use:</p>

<p>1. Investors wishing to see the return on common equity may modify the formula above by subtracting preferred dividends from net income and subtracting preferred equity from shareholders' equity, giving the following: return on common equity (ROCE) = net income - preferred dividends / common equity.</p>

<p>2. Return on equity may also be calculated by dividing net income by <i>average</i> shareholders' equity. Average shareholders' equity is calculated by adding the shareholders' equity at the beginning of a period to the shareholders' equity at period's end and dividing the result by two.</p>

<p>3. Investors may also calculate the change in ROE for a period by first using the shareholders' equity figure from the beginning of a period as a denominator to determine the beginning ROE. Then, the end-of-period shareholders' equity can be used as the denominator to determine the ending ROE. Calculating both beginning and ending ROEs allows an investor to determine the change in profitability over the period.</p>
