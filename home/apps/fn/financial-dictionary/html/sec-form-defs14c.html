<h1>SEC Form DEFS14C</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be filed by a registrant intending to hold a special meeting. SEC Form DEFS14C applies to security holders who were entitled to vote on issues for which the company was not soliciting proxies. It provided security holders with information required by Schedule 14A as well as information about whether certain persons, such as directors, officers and associates, had an interest in corporate matters that differed from the interest of general shareholders, or intended to oppose action to be taken by the corporation at a shareholders' meeting. The form was required to state that proxies were not being solicited.</p>

<p>Form DEFS14C, "Definitive information statement for special meeting",  was required under Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form was filed with the SEC when a registrant intended to hold a special meeting and helped the SEC protect shareholders' rights by ensuring that they received key information, clearly presented.</p>
