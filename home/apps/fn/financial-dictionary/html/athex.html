<h1>Athens Stock Exchange - ATHEX</h1>

<p>The Athens Stock Exchange or ASE or ATHEX is a stock exchange located in Athens, Greece. The Athens Stock Exchange originally began trading in the late 1870s. Until 2007 the exchange was located in Psiris, Athens. The street where it was located, Sofocleous St., became synonymous with the exchange, much like Wall Street in New York City.</p>

<p>As of 2010, the Athens Stock Exchange is a subsidiary of Hellenic Exchanges S.A., a public company which lists its shares on the ATHEX. In 1999, derivatives began being offered on the exchange, and in 2002 the Athens Stock Exchange and the Athens Derivatives Exchange merged to form the ATHEX.</p>
