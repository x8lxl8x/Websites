<h1>Dealer Financing</h1>

<p>Loans that are originated by a retailer to its customers and are then sold to a bank or other third-party financial institution. The bank purchases these loans at a discount and then collects principle and interest payments from the borrower. Also called an indirect loan.</p>

<p>A well-known example of dealer financing is auto dealers that offer car purchase financing. Many car dealers markup the finance company's interest rate and keep the difference as additional profit.</p>
