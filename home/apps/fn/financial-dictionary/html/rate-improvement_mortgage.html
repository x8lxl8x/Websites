<h1>Rate-Improvement Mortgage</h1>

<p>A type of fixed-rate mortgage, which contains a clause that entitles the borrower to reduce the fixed-interest-rate charge on the mortgage once, and early in the mortgage. The option will be exercised when interest rates fall lower then the borrowers initial mortgage rate.</p>

<p>There is typically a fee associated with exercising this option, and the initial mortgage might have a higher-than market-interest rate and/or high costs. However, the rate reduction option could save the borrower the costs of refinancing which might be more then the cost of using their rate improvement option.</p>

<p>There is no "free lunch" in the world of finance. A borrower who is told that they are being "given" the option to reduce their interest rate for a minimal fee should be aware that the lender has the true cost of that option priced in the transaction somewhere.</p>

<p>That's not to say the option is not fairly priced and could be valuable to the borrower should interest rates fall. The borrower should simply have a good understanding of the costs, risks and benefits of paying for the option in the initial transaction.</p>
