<h1>SEC Form S-11</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is used to register securities that are issued by real estate investment trusts (REITs) or by those whose business is acquiring or holding real estate for the purpose of investment.</p>

<p>Form S-11, is also known as the Registration Statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 for certain real estate companies. The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
