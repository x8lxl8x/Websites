<h1>Legging In</h1>

<p>1. Setting up the entry position of a complex financial investment separately from setting up the exit or unwinding of the position.</p>

<p>2. When a debtor or creditor enters into a hedging contract after the debt instrument has been issued or acquired in order to lower financial risk.</p>

<p>Legging in is a common practice used to lower risk when buying and selling commodities futures contracts. Any gain or loss as a result of the legging-in hedging strategy is deferred until the qualified instrument matures, at which time it is either disposed of or otherwise terminated.</p>

<p>Legging in can also refer to a slow paced investment strategy characterized by numerous continued buy/sell orders rather than entering/exiting into a position in bulk amounts.</p>
