<h1>SEC Form 25</h1>

<p>A notification given to the SEC by a national securities exchange telling of the removal from listing on that exchange and registration of matured, redeemed or retired corporate securities. SEC Form 25 is required by Rule 12d2-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A security is considered to be delisted 10 days after the filing of Form 25 with the SEC.</p>

<p>Securities may be delisted from an exchange for various reasons. Bonds may have matured or been called and redeemed by a company. Another reason may be that a company has been taken over by another company and all of its outstanding securities have been exchanged for cash or another security.</p>
