<h1>Speculation</h1>

<p>The act of trading in an asset, or conducting a financial transaction, that has a significant risk of losing most or all of the initial outlay, in expectation of a substantial gain. With speculation, the risk of loss is more than offset by the possibility of a huge gain; otherwise, there would be very little motivation to speculate. While it is often confused with gambling, the key difference is that speculation is generally tantamount to taking a calculated risk and is not dependent on pure chance, whereas gambling depends on totally random outcomes or chance.</p>

<p>It may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between speculation and investment, and whether an activity qualifies as speculative or investing depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset, the expected duration of the holding period, and the amount of leverage.</p>

<p>For example, while acquiring an additional property (in addition to one's principal residence) with the intention of renting it out would qualify as a bona fide investing activity, buying half a dozen condominiums with minimal down payments for the purpose of "condo-flipping" would undoubtedly be regarded as speculation.</p>

<p>Speculation has its benefits in a free economy. By their willingness to assume the other side of the trade (for a price, of course), speculators provide market liquidity and narrow the bid-ask spread, enabling producers to hedge price risk. Speculative short-selling may also keep rampant bullishness in check and prevent the formation of asset price bubbles.</p>
