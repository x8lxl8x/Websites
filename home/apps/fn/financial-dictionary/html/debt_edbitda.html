<p>Debt/EBITDA is a common metric used by credit rating agencies to assess the probability of defaulting on issued debt. A high debt/EBITDA ratio suggests that a firm may not be able to service their debt in an appropriate manner and can result in a lowered credit rating. Conversely, a low ratio can suggest that the firm may want take on more debt if needed and it often warrants a relatively high credit rating.</p>
