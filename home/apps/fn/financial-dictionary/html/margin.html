<h1>Margin</h1>

<p>1. Borrowed money that is used to purchase securities. This practice is referred to as "buying on margin".</p>

<p>2. The amount of equity contributed by a customer as a percentage of the current market value of the securities held in a margin account.</p>

<p>3. In a general business context, the difference between a product's (or service's) selling price and the cost of production.</p>

<p>4. The portion of the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage that is over and above the adjustment-index rate. This portion is retained as profit by the lender.</p>

<p>1. Buying with borrowed money can be extremely risky because both gains and losses are amplified. That is, while the potential for greater profit exists, this comes at a hefty price - the potential for greater losses. Margin also subjects the investor to a number of unique risks such as interest payments for use of the borrowed money.</p>

<p>2. For example, if you hold futures contracts in a margin account, you have to maintain a certain amount of margin depending on how the market value of the contracts change.</p>

<p>3. Gross profit margin (which is the difference between revenue and expenses) is one measure of a company's performance.</p>

<p>4. The formula for calculating the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is the adjustment-index rate (e.g. Treasury Index) plus the percentage of the margin. For example, if the Treasury Index is 6% and the interest rate on the mortgage is 8%, the margin is 2%.</p>
