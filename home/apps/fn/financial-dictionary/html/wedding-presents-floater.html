<h1>Wedding Presents Floater </h1>

<p>A type of insurance that can be added to a renter's or homeowner's insurance policy to temporarily cover the value of the gifts a couple receives when they get married. The wedding presents floater is a short-term policy designed to cover the gifts while they are getting moved from the wedding site to the couple's home and/or while they are being moved around as the newly married couple transitions to a new residence.</p>

<p>A typical length for this type of policy is 90 days. Certain types of gifts may be excluded from this coverage, such as vehicles and cash. If a couple receives gifts that are sufficiently valuable and will not be covered by their basic homeowner's or renter's policy, such as silverware or jewelry, they may want to purchase a scheduled personal property floater or personal articles floater to provide long-term coverage for those items.</p>
