<h1>Pure Risk</h1>

<p>A category of risk in which loss is the only possible outcome; there is no beneficial result. Pure risk is related to events that are beyond the risk-taker's control and, therefore, a person cannot consciously take on pure risk.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of speculative risk.</p>

<p>For example, the possibility that a person's house will be destroyed due to a natural disaster is pure risk. In this example, it is unlikely that there would be any potential benefit to this risk.</p>

<p>There are products that can be purchased to mitigate pure risk. For example, home insurance can be used to protect homeowners from the risk that their homes will be destroyed.</p>

<p>Other examples of pure risk events include premature death, identity theft and career-ending disabilities.</p>
