<h1>Closing Quote</h1>

<p>A security's final regular-hours trading price for the day. Because of the forces of supply and demand, the previous day's closing quote will not necessarily be the next day's opening quote. The first trade of the next day will not occur until the first buyer and seller agree on a price. The closing quote is used to compare the change in the price of a security from day to day.</p>

<p>On most exchanges, securities are traded Monday through Friday, from 9:30am to 4pm EST - except for major holidays, when the exchanges are closed. For the NYSE and Nasdaq, these holidays are New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr., Day, President's Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. The highest trading volume still occurs during regular trading hours. However, shares can also be traded pre-market and after hours.</p>
