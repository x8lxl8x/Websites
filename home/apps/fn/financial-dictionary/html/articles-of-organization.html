<h1>Articles Of Organization</h1>

<p>A formal legal document used to establish a limited liability (LLC) company at the state level. The document should include the business's name and address, the names and addresses of the LLC's members, the names and addresses of its managers/organizers/directors, the name of the business's registered agent, and a statement of the business's purpose. The state will also require the business to pay a fee when it files its articles of organization.</p>

<p>Rather than having to write articles of organization from scratch, it's often possible to obtain a fill-in-the-blank form from the state government's website. Although all articles of organization generally require the same basic information, requirements will vary slightly from state to state.</p>
