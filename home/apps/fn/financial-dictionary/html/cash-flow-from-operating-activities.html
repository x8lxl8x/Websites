<h1>Cash Flow From Operating Activities (CFO)</h1>

<p>An accounting item indicating the cash a company brings in from ongoing, regular business activities. Cash flow from operating activities does not include long-term capital or investment costs. It can be calculated as:</p>

<p>Cash Flow From Operating Activities = EBIT + Depreciation - Taxes</p>

<p>Also called Operating Cash Flow.</p>

<p>Cash flow from operating activities is reported on the cash flow statement in a company's quarterly/annual report. Income that a company receives from investment activities is reported separately, since it is not from business operations.</p>

<p>Comparing the cash flow from operating activities with EBITDA can give insights into how a company finances short-term capital.</p>
