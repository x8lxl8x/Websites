<h1>Nonsegregated Disclosures </h1>

<p>Information that legally must be presented anywhere in a lease agreement. Nonsegregated disclosures are required by the Federal Reserve Board Regulation M. The lease agreement must also contain segregated disclosures, which are placed in a distinct and defined section of the contract. These are intended to protect consumers by clearly providing them with all the information they need to understand the contracts they are entering.</p>

<p>Nonsegregated disclosures include information about government-required fees and taxes; whether the lessor or lessee will be responsible for insurance and how much it will cost; the leased item's estimated residual value; standards of excess wear and tear; lessor and lessee maintenance responsibilities; early termination and default; warranties; lessor's security interest; late payment fees; and whether there is a purchase option and what the purchase option price is.</p>
