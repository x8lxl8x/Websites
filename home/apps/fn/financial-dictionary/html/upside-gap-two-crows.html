<h1>Upside Gap Two Crows</h1>

<p>A bearish market reversal signal in technical analysis. The upside gap two crows pattern is a three-day formation on candlestick charts that typically develops in the following manner:</p>

<p>Day 1 - A bullish day that continues the uptrend, represented by a long white candlestick, which indicates that the closing price of the index or security is well above the opening price.</p>

<p>Day 2 - A bearish day despite the index or security gapping higher at the open, represented by a small black or colored candlestick.</p>

<p>Day 3 - A second bearish day, with the index or security opening higher than the Day 2 open, but closing below the Day 2 close and above the Day 1 close. This is visually represented by a bigger black or colored candlestick that "engulfs" the Day 2 candlestick.</p>

<p>The upside gap two crows is viewed by chartists as a somewhat ominous pattern, since it potentially signals that the index or security may be rolling over as its upward move ends and a downtrend commences. The rationale for this interpretation is that despite two stronger opens (on Days 2 and 3), the bulls have been unable to maintain upward momentum, suggesting that sentiment is turning from bullish to bearish for the index or security.</p>
