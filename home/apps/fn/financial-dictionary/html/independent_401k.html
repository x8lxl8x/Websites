<h1>Independent 401(k)</h1>

<p>A 401(k) plan set up for an individual running a sole proprietorship or a small business with a spouse/immediate family member. Plan contribution limits for the individual are equal to a typical company-sponsored 401(k), but the sole proprietor can also make an employer contribution to an independent 401(k), thereby raising the total contribution allowed.</p>

<p>The independent 401(k) may also be called a "solo 401(k)" or an "indie K".</p>

<p>As with standard 401(k) plans, catch-up contributions are allowed for those above age 50 who have indie 401(k)s - up to $5,000 in 2006. Contributions made to the plan as an employer are also tax-deductible, which can help to save the sole proprietor a great deal in taxes.</p>

<p>The independent 401(k) offers many of the same features as a Keogh plan or an SEP IRA, but an independent 401(k) can be cheaper to establish and maintain, and loans are often allowed against an independent 401(k).</p>

<p>The major drawback to the independent 401(k) is that no outside employees can be hired, or the window of applicability closes.</p>
