<h1>Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate - SONIA</h1>

<p>An index that the tracks Sterling overnight funding rates for trades that occur in off hours. The Sterling overnight funding rate is a reflection of the depth of the overnight business in the market.</p>

<p>The Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (SONIA) was established in 1997 by the Wholesale Markets Brokers' Association in Great Britain. Prior to the SONIA the Wholesale Markets Brokers' Association had no Sterling overnight funding rate. This void created volatility in England's overnight interest rates. When the SONIA was created, it gave a stability to overnight rates and also encouraged the creation of the Overnight Index Swaps markets and the Sterling Money Markets in Great Britain.</p>
