<h1>Periodic Payment Plan</h1>

<p>A type of investment plan, often sold to military personnel, that allows an investor to accumulate shares of a mutual fund indirectly by contributing a small, fixed sum over a period of usually 10, 15, or 25 years. In exchange for these payments, the investor owns an interest in a plan trust, which invests in a mutual fund. The plan trust's sponsor makes money by charging a "creation and sales charge", also known as a "front-end load", to investors. This sales charge is as high as 50% of the first 12 months' worth of payments, making periodic payment plans a potentially expensive investment option, especially for investors who do not remain invested for the full length of the plan.</p>

<p>Most periodic payment plans also have an annual fee and small monthly custodial fees. As a result of these fees, investors may be able to get a better deal by purchasing mutual fund shares directly. While the low required monthly contribution may be a selling point of a periodic payment plan, some brokerage companies, whose fees may be lower than that of a periodic payment plan, will allow investors to make small monthly investments and avoid large minimum investments if they establish automatic deposits.</p>

<p>Also known as a "contractual plan" or "systematic investment plan".</p>
