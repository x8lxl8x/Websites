<h1>Canada's New Stock Exchange - CNQ</h1>

<p>An alternative stock exchange for micro-cap and emerging companies in Canada. Canada's New Stock Exchange (CNQ) offers companies simplified reporting requirements and reduced barriers to entry, compared to the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange. The CNQ does this through its model, which attempts to remove the duplication of regulation between the exchange and the provincial securities commissions.</p>

<p>The purpose of the CNQ is to strengthen investor confidence in emerging companies through enhanced disclosure and high regulatory oversight standards. The result is a stock exchange that maximizes liquidity and fosters entrepreneurial spirit, while also offering better protection to investors.</p>
