<h1>Magna Cum Laude</h1>

<p>An academic level of distinction used by educational institutions to signify an academic degree which was received "with great honor". Magna cum laude is one of three commonly used types of Latin honors which are recognized in the United States, the other two being summa cum laude and cum laude. Magna cum laude is typically more prestigious than cum laude honors but less prestigious than summa cum laude honors.</p>

<p>The guidelines by which each level of academic honors is achieved differs between academic institutions, however every university or college will outline their expectations for each program. Although Latin honors are quite common in the United States, very few countries around the world use the Latin system.</p>
