<h1>Redenomination</h1>

<p>1. The process whereby a country's currency is recalibrated due to significant inflation and currency devaluation. Certain currencies have been redenominated a number of times over the last century for various reasons.</p>

<p>2. The process of changing the currency value on a financial security.
1. For example, the Bulgarian lev was redenominated due to inflation arising at the end of the Second World War. After the redenomination, one "new" lev was equal to 100 "old" levs. The lev was redenominated three times in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>2. A recent example of redenomination arose when the euro was introduced and the denomination on many European securities had to be changed to the euro.           </p>
