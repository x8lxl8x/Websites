<h1>American Association Of Individual Investors - AAII</h1>

<p>A non-profit, membership-driven investor education organization. The American Association Of Individual Investors (AAII) was founded in 1978 by James Cloonan. The AAII's mission is to teach individuals to manage their own portfolios and to beat average S&P 500 returns, while taking on lower-than-average levels of risk. AAII also publishes the results of its weekly investor confidence surveys that are based on its members' feelings about where the stock market is headed.</p>

<p>AAII charges annual dues for access to its investor education materials, which include the monthly AAII Journal, mutual fund analysis, stock reports and research, stock picks, stock screeners, an annual tax strategy guide and model portfolios for stocks and mutual funds. The organization has local chapters throughout the United States, has been selected for Forbes' Best of the Web directory and has been highly rated by the Better Business Bureau.</p>
