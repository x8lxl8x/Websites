<h1>Commuting Expenses</h1>

<p>Expenses that are incurred as a result of the taxpayer's regular means of getting back and forth to his or her place of employment. Commuting expenses can include car expenses and public transportation costs.</p>

<p>Commuting expenses are never deductible, unless the taxpayer has more than one job. In this case, the cost of commuting from one place of employment to the other on a regular basis would be tax deductible.</p>
