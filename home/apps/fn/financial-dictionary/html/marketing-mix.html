<h1>Marketing Mix</h1>

<p>Usually referring to E. Jerome McCarthy's 4 P classification for developing an effective marketing strategy, which encompasses: product, price, placement (distribution) and promotion. When it's a consumer-centric marketing mix, it has been extended to include three more Ps: people, process and physical evidence, and three Cs: cost, consumer and competitor. Depending on the industry and the target of the marketing plan, marketing managers will take various approaches to each of the four Ps.</p>

<p>The term "marketing-mix," was first coined by Neil Borden, the president of the American Marketing Association in 1953. It is still used today to make important decisions that lead to the execution of a marketing plan. The various approaches that are used have evolved over time, especially with the increased use of technology.</p>
