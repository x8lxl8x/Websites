<h1>Joint Account</h1>

<p>A bank or brokerage account that is shared between two or more individuals. Joint accounts are most likely to be used between relatives, couples or business partners who have a level of familiarity and trust for each other, as this type of account typically allows anyone named on the account to access funds within it.</p>

<p>Joint accounts can be established on a permanent basis, such as an account between a couple where their salaries are deposited, or may be temporary, such as an account between two parties who contribute funds for a short-term purpose. In the event of a death of one of the account holders, the remaining account holders will have sole access to the funds, as well as any debts associated with the account.</p>
