<h1>Clean Balance Sheet</h1>

<p>A company's financial statement that summarizes its assets, liabilities and shareholder equity, and where the company is shown to have very little or no debt. A clean balance sheet indicates the company has no significant debt during the statement period. A company that has a lot of debt may be advised to "clean up its balance sheet" in order to become more attractive to investors.</p>

<p>A clean balance sheet is challenging to maintain, especially for businesses that derive a significant percentage of yearly revenues from seasonal activity. Many investors find companies with clean balance sheets attractive because the minimal leverage reduces downside risks.</p>
