<h1>Credit Denial</h1>

<p>The rejection of a credit application by the prospective lender. Usually credit denial comes as a result of the borrower's perceived inability to pay back the loan. This is often due to previous blemishes on the borrower's credit history, but it can also stem from an incomplete credit application or lack of any kind of borrowing history.</p>

<p>The Equal Credit Opportunity Act mandates that lenders who deny credit to their applicants must state their reason for the rejection. Borrowers who are rejected because of adverse reports from other creditors have the right to review a copy of their credit report. This term is synonymous with credit decline or credit rejection.</p>
