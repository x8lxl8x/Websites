<h1>Automatic Stay</h1>

<p>A legal provision that temporarily prevents creditors from pursuing debtors for amounts owed. An automatic stay goes into effect immediately when a debtor files for bankruptcy. Creditors who believe they have sufficient grounds can petition the court to lift the automatic stay so they can continue the collection process. A bankruptcy filing in bad faith will not create an automatic stay. Also, certain debts, such as child support, are not stayed.</p>

<p>Once an automatic stay is in effect, creditors are unlikely to receive the full amounts they are owed. Instead, they will receive a proportional share of the bankrupt debtor's limited assets. A debtor may sue a creditor who continues to contact them or who attempts to sue them after an automatic stay is in place.</p>
