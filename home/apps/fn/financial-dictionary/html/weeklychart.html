<h1>Weekly Chart</h1>

<p>A chart where each data point is comprised of the price movement for a single week of trading. This type of chart typically shows high, low, open, and close for the whole week and does not show the day-to-day movements of the security. This type of chart is used by technical analysts to gauge the long-term trend of a given asset.</p>

<p>A weekly chart can vary in appearance depending on what form of chart the analyst chooses to use. For example, a weekly line chart will only include the weekly closing price while a weekly candlestick chart will display the open, high, low and close for the week. This chart construction is used to give a long-term view of the security as it includes much more historical price movement than an equivalent period day chart.</p>
