<h1>Forex Training</h1>

<p>A form of instruction or mentorship that provides information on forex trading tactics, methods and successful practices. Forex training acts as a guide for the retail forex trader, providing insight into successful strategies, signals and systems as well as other general information on the foreign exchange market.</p>

<p>Because of the massive size of the forex market, there is a wealth of information available for traders who are looking to enhance their trading knowledge.</p>

<p>Remember that there is no "holy grail" of trading! If the system and signals in the training program were foolproof, the developer would be using them exclusively, rather than distributing the information to others.</p>
