<h1>All-Pay Auction</h1>

<p>An economic and game theory concept in which participants place silent bids on a particular item. Unlike a standard auction, all-pay auction has everybody pay for their bid, regardless of whether they win the item being sold. Of course, in a standard auction, the highest bid wins the item.</p>

<p>An example of an all-pay auction is a Tullock auction, which is sometimes referred to as a Tullock lottery. Rather than being just another form of commerce, the Tullock auction and other all-pay auctions are largely intellectual pursuits, used to describe economic behaviors.</p>

<p>For example, in a standard auction, a seller might expect to receive fair value for the goods he or she is offering. However, in an all-play auction, overbidding is common and the seller might expect to get better-than-fair value.</p>
