<h1>Mortgage Constant</h1>

<p>A ratio between the annual amount of debt servicing to the total value of the loan. The mortgage constant is only applicable to mortgages that pay a fixed rate.</p>

<p>Also known as the "mortgage capitalization rate".
This constant also can be used to calculate the highest loan value that could be received on a property given the income generated by that property, if it is a commercial or rental property. For example, if the total amount paid annually on a $200,000 loan is $5,000, the mortgage constant would be 5,000 / 200,000 = .025, or 2.5%.            </p>
