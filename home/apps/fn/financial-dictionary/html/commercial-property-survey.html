<h1>Commercial Property/Casualty Market Index Survey</h1>

<p>A survey of its members in the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers regarding the commercial property/casualty market. This quarterly Commercial Property/Casualty Market Index Survey covers the rate of premiums over small, medium and large commercial accounts; tracks regional trends; and provides member commentary on market conditions, pricing practices and trends. The council's other survey is the biannual Employee Benefits Market Index.</p>

<p>Commercial Property/Casualty Market Index surveys are promoted by press releases and used by news media, policy makers and consumers to learn about and comment on market conditions. It was established in 1999 and is the longest-running survey of its kind. The council's members are particularly qualified to provide the data for this survey because they place 80% of all commercial property/casualty premiums in the United States.</p>
