<h1>Advance Canvass</h1>

<p>A technique used by companies to generate "buzz" in advance of a new product launch or promotional campaign, by visiting retailers to obtain their support. Advance canvassing is generally done when the launch is imminent, as doing it well ahead of the launch may reduce its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Marketing representatives who are advance canvassers may offer additional incentives to their retailers for favored product placement and for exceeding sales targets for the new product. The company behind the new product needs to ensure not only that it has sufficient quantities in stock to satisfy initial demand, but also that the product performance lives up to the high expectations created by advance canvassing.</p>
