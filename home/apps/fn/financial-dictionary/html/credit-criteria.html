<h1>Credit Criteria</h1>

<p>The various financial characteristics that lenders analyze when scrutinizing a prospective borrower. Credit criteria include a borrower's assets and liabilities, income and expenses and credit history. Favorable criteria will usually result in approval, with poor criteria typically having the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Credit criteria can also include the number of open accounts with other creditors and the borrower's standing with each one. Any single credit criterion can be used to deny credit to the prospective borrower, but the lender must obey all laws of the credit protection act. Race, age and gender are not acceptable criteria for acceptance or rejection of credit.</p>
