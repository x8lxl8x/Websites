<h1>Underinsured Motorist Coverage</h1>

<p>An auto insurance policy provision that extends coverage to include property and bodily damage caused by a motorist with insufficient insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage is designed to provide the injured party with compensation above what is alloted by the at-fault party's policy.</p>

<p>State laws typically require all motorists to have some form of auto insurance, although it is difficult for those states to maintain 100% compliance. Some drivers will purchase only the minimum amount of coverage required by law. The addition of underinsured motorist coverage usually adds only a nominal expense to the general insurance coverage.</p>
