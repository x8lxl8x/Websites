<h1>Interpolated Yield Curve - I Curve</h1>

<p>A yield curve derived by using on-the-run treasuries. Because on-the-run treasuries are limited to specific maturities, the yield of maturities that lies between the on-the-run treasuries must be interpolated. This can be accomplished by a number of methodologies, including bootstrapping and regressions.</p>

<p>Several different types of fixed-income securities trade at yield spreads to the I curve, making it an important benchmark.</p>

<p>For example, certain agency CMOs trade at a spread to the I curve at a spot on the curve equal to their weighted average lives. A CMO's weighted average life will most likely lie somewhere within the on-the-run treasuries, which makes the derivation of the I curve necessary.</p>
