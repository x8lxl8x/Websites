<h1>Labor Productivity</h1>

<p>A measurement of economic growth of a country. Labor productivity measures the amount of goods and services produced by one hour of labor. More specifically, labor productivity measures the amount of real GDP produced by an hour of labor. Growing labor productivity depends on three main factors: investment and saving in physical capital, new technology and human capital.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the real GDP of an economy is $10 trillion and the aggregate hours of labor in the country was 300 billion. The labor productivity would be $10 trillion divided by 300 billion, equaling about $33 per labor hour. Growth in this labor productivity number can usually be interpreted as improvements or rising standards of living in the country.</p>
