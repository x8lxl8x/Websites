<h1>Quote Driven Market</h1>

<p>An electronic stock exchange system in which prices are determined from bid and ask quotations made by market makers, dealers or specialists. In a quote driven market, also known as a price driven market, dealers fill orders from their own inventory or by matching them with other orders. A quote driven market is the opposite of an order driven market, which displays individual investors' bid and ask prices and the number of shares they want to trade.</p>

<p>Order execution is not guaranteed in an order driven market, but it is guaranteed in a quote driven market because market makers are required to meet the bid and ask prices they quote. A quote driven market is more liquid but lacks transparency. A hybrid market combines the features of both quote driven and order driven markets. The NYSE and Nasdaq are both considered hybrid markets.</p>
