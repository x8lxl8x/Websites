<h1>Spud</h1>

<p>In the oil and gas industry, the process of beginning to drill a well. Initially a larger drill bit is used to drill a surface hole, which is lined with casing and cement to protect groundwater. After the surface hole is completed, the main drill bit is inserted and the well is drilled to the total depth.</p>

<p>Can also be referred to as "spudding in".</p>

<p>Drilling for oil and gas is a highly complex task involving sophisticated techniques and machinery. It often costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill even a simple well.
