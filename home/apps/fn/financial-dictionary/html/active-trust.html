<h1>Active Trust</h1>

<p>A trust where the trustee is held accountable for additional responsibilities. With an active trust, those additional responsibilities can be in respect to the control or management of the trust, collection of rent, profits, and sale proceeds; in other words the administration of the trust property.</p>

<p>Also referred to as a special trust.</p>

<p>An active trust is in contrast to a passive trust in which the trustee performs no active duties. A trust is a relationship where the trustor gives another person, the trustee, the right to hold title to a property or assets for a beneficiary. It is commonly used if the beneficiary is underage or has a disability that impairs them from maintaining their own finances.</p>
