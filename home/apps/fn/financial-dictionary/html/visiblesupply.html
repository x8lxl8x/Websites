<h1>Visible Supply</h1>

<p>The amount of a good that is currently being stored or transported. The visible supply is the amount of goods or commodities that are available to be bought or sold. This supply is important as it identifies a definite quantity of good available for purchase or delivery upon futures contracts.</p>

<p>The price of a good is not completely influenced by the amount of visible supply. Because commodities, such as wheat, are often purchased through futures contracts long before delivery, prices are more likely to be influenced by future supply rather than what is available at that moment. In general, an increase in visible supply is considered to be a bearish signal, while a decrease is considered a bullish one.</p>
