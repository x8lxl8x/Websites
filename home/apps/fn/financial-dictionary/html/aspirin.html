<h1>Australian Stock Price Riskless Indexed Note - ASPIRIN</h1>

<p>A zero-coupon bond with a return linked to the Australian all-ordinaries stock index. The bond has a four-year maturity and is repayable at face value, with a yield derived from the index's percentage increase over a predetermined level.</p>

<p>Also known as an "All-Ordinaries Share Price Riskless Indexed Note".</p>

<p>An aspirin is an alternative investment opportunity to those who wish to capture gains in the stock market, but mitigate the downside risk. The note will pay the investor a return when the stock index performs above a specific percentage, for example, if the hurdle was 10% and the index returned 15%, the aspirin holder would receive a yield of 5%. The downside of the note occurs if the index does not outperform its hurdle. In this case, the investor experiences zero return over a four-year period.</p>
