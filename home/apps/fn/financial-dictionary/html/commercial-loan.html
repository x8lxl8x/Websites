<h1>Commercial Loan</h1>

<p>A debt-based funding arrangement that a business can set up with a financial institution. The proceeds of commercial loans may be used to fund large capital expenditures and/or operations that a business may otherwise be unable to afford.</p>

<p>Due to expensive upfront costs and regulation related hurdles, smaller businesses do not typically have direct access to the debt and equity markets for financing purposes. Therefore,  they must rely on financial institutions to meet their financing needs.</p>

<p>Similar to consumer credit, businesses have a variety of lending products to choose from. A line of credit, term loans and unsecured loans are just a few examples. However, small businesses should shop around at different institutions to determine which lender offers the best terms for the loan.</p>
