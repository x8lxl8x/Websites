<h1>Domestic Corporate Goods Price Index Japan</h1>

<p>A Japanese index that measures the prices of goods created by firms at the producer and wholesaler level in Japan. The Domestic Corporate Goods Price Index (CGPI) tracks changes in supply side prices within the Japanese economy. Changes in the CGPI often precede changes in the overall Consumer Price Index, as input values determine the overall retail values of the consumer goods. Thus, a large increase in the domestic CGPI will lead to a large increase in the overall CPI.</p>

<p>The domestic CGPI has a base year of 2005, using 100 as its base value. The index is published on the eighth business day of each month and typically can have a large effect on the equities, commodities and forex markets following its release. The headline figures are the percentage change in the overall domestic CGPI month over month, while the report itself publishes separate indices for each commodity category.</p>
