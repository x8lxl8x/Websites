<h1>SEC Form F-X</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that requires an issuer that is doing one of the following to appoint an agent that may be served processes, pleadings, subpoenas or other papers:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering securities using SEC Forms F-8, F-9, F-10 or F-80 under the Securities Act of 1933;</li>
<li>registering securities using SEC Form 40-F under the Securities Act of 1933;</li>
<li>filing tender offer documents on SEC Forms 13E-4F, 14D-1F or 14D-9F;</li>
<li>a Canadian issuer qualifying an offering pursuant to Regulation A; or</li>
<li>any foreign issuer using Form CB in connection with a tender offer, rights offering or business combination; or acting as trustee for securities registered using form F-7, F-8, F-9, F-10, F-80</li>
</ul>

<p>Form F-X is also known as the Appointment of Agent for Service of Process and Undertaking, and is filed under the Securities Act of 1933. This Act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the Act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
