<h1>Sales Meeting</h1>

<p>A gathering in which a product or service is being discussed, and the benefits are outlined to the potential buyer. The sales meeting is not always a presentation format; it can sometimes be an informal conversation, phone call or online affair. The parties involved have this meeting between the initial contact and final purchase, in order to entice the customer.</p>

<p>Also known as a sales conference.</p>

<p>A sales meeting is designed to sell the product, build relationships, identify needs and outline benefits of the product. Personal financial planners would use a sales meeting to discuss retirement goals, build rapport and explain how the investment products and fund management will meet the goals of the potential client.</p>
