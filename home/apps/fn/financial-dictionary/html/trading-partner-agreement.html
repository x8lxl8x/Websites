<h1>Trading Partner Agreement</h1>

<p>An agreement drawn up by two parties that have agreed to trade certain items or information to each other. The agreement outlines the terms of the trade or trading process, such as compensation for the shorted party in an inequitable trade. Trading Partner Agreements are often tailored for electronic transactions.</p>

<p>Trading Partner Agreements may include a list of duties and responsibilities to be allocated to each party in the trade. They could also specify the terms of delivery or receipt of the goods or services. There is no single formal format for this type of agreement, or specific required content for them.</p>
