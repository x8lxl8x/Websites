<h1>Schedule I Bank</h1>

<p>A Canadian financial institution regulated under the Federal Bank Act. A Schedule I bank cannot be wholly owned by non-residents.</p>

<p>Under Bill C-8, implemented on October 24, 2001, the Schedule I and II bank structures were replaced with a new size-based ownership regime which is based upon the institution's equity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Institutions with over $5 billion in equity are required to have no person owning more than 20% of the voting shares or 30% of the non-voting shares.</li>
<li>Institutions with equity of $1 billion to $5 billion have fewer restrictions on ownership, as they are only subject to having a public float of 35% of voting shares.</li>
<li>Institutions with less than $1 billion in equity have no ownership restriction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the Schedule I and II bank structures have been replaced, they are still widely used to describe the two structures of bank in Canada.</p>
