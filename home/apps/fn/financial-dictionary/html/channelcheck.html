<h1>Channel Check</h1>

<p>A method of independent stock analysis whereby company information is supplied by third parties. Channel checks are most often conversations or personal research done by researchers or third-party information providers with direct managers of businesses within a certain sector or industry. Channel checks are thought of as getting the information "straight from the horse's mouth."</p>

<p>Many times, when stock analysts provide ratings for specific companies, the company being analyzed supplies the information that is used. When doing a channel check, the analyst is using information that is not supplied by the company because he or she is independently investigating the company's financial health.</p>

<p>Channel checks have come under scrutiny in recent years as regulators question whether such research should be considered inside information, or just personal research.</p>
