<h1>Broad Form Insurance</h1>

<p>Insurance coverage that extends beyond the basics to include rare events that may be of serious risk to the insured. This type of insurance usually requires that a higher premium, and often a deductible, be paid. Broad form insurance can be applied to nearly all forms of insurance including investments, assets, etc.</p>

<p>An example of this type of insurance can be found in automobile insurance. A customer may require glass insurance as the driver is frequently on the highway and obtains a lot of chips in the front window. Glass insurance is not offered under the basic plan and therefore must be specifically requested and a premium must be paid.</p>
