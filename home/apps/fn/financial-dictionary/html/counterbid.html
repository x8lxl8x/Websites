<h1>Counterbid</h1>

<p>A purchase offer made in counter to the offer of another potential purchaser. The term is often used in discussing the sale of one business to another. During a bargaining process it is not uncommmon for each side to issue multiple counter offers during the negotiation process.</p>

<p>Counter offers can come in a variety of options. During a sale negotiation either party will make counter offers opposing the other party's offer to reach an agreed price which more closely suits their preferred price. Informal counter offers occur on a daily basis as well, when deciding where to eat lunch to what to watch on the television.</p>
