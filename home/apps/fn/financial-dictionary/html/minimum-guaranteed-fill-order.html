<h1>Minimum Guaranteed Fill Order- MGF</h1>

<p>A service provided by market makers in its assigned stocks to maintain fair and orderly markets. Minimum guaranteed fill (MGF) orders are a guaranteed fill for small market orders from retail clients up to a specific size at the best posted bid or ask price. Each stock has a MGF volume that depends on its liquidity. Clients who place market orders or limit orders can benefit from MGF orders.</p>

<p>For example, assume a stock that has an MGF volume of 1,200 shares is trading at $4 /$4.10, with 600 shares bid at $4, and 400 shares offered at $4.10. If a client puts in a market order to purchase 900 shares, he or she will receive 400 shares at the posted offer price of $4.10, and the balance 500 shares from the market maker, also at $4.10.</p>
