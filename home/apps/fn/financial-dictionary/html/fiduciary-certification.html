<h1>Fiduciary Certification</h1>

<p>The certification process to ensure that fiduciaries uphold the prudent investment guidelines and practices set forth by state regulations. A certified fiduciary needs to fulfill all legal requirements set forth by the designation and adhere to the best practices doctrine.</p>

<p>Fiduciary certifications are distributed at the state level and can be revoked by the courts if a person is found to neglect his or her duties. To become certified, a fiduciary is required to pass an examination that tests his or her knowledge of laws, practices, and security related procedures such as background checks and screening.</p>
