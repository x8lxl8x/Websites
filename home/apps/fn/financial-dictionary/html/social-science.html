<h1>Social Sciences</h1>

<p>A group of academic disciplines that examine society and how people interact and develop as a culture. Social science as a field of study is separate from the natural sciences, which cover topics such as physics and chemistry. Economics, political science, history, law and geography can be considered social sciences.</p>

<p>Social science as an academic field of study developed out of the Age of Enlightenment as individuals began to take a more disciplined approach to quantifying their observations of society. Over time, similar aspects of a society, such as communication, were separated into unique fields of study. Statistical surveys and research methodologies helped prove or disprove theories.</p>
