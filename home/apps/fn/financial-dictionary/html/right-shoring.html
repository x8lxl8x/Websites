<h1>Right-Shoring</h1>

<p>The placement of a business' components and processes in localities and countries that provide the best combination of cost and efficiency. Right-shoring does not require a company to move business processes overseas. Rather, it is a strategy in which a business analyzes the complexity and importance of required tasks and entrusts their completion with the most suitable workforce, regardless of location.</p>

<p>Right-shoring requires a business to maintain a balance between the work types that can be outsourced overseas and the ones that should be kept domestic. Commonly, less complex types of work and work that carries a lower level of importance can be shifted abroad, while complex and important types, or ones that require extensive customer interaction, are kept at home.</p>
