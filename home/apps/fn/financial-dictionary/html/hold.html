<h1>Hold</h1>

<p>An analyst's recommendation to neither buy nor sell a security. A company with a hold recommendation generally is expected to perform with the market or at the same pace as comparable companies.</p>

<p>Also known as "neutral" or "market perform".</p>

<p>Exact definitions vary by brokerage, but this rating is better than sell, but worse than buy. It means that if you own a security you still shouldn't sell, but you also should not buy the security if you don't own it already (or do not buy more of it if you do).</p>
