<h1>Adam Crozier</h1>

<p>The CEO of British broadcaster ITV. Crozier is also a former CEO of the UK's Royal Mail from 2003 to 2009 and the Football Association (FA) from 1999 to 2002. At FA, his marketing plan skyrocketed the company's revenue in just two years. At the Royal Mail, his job was to prepare the unprofitable company for postal deregulation, when it would no longer be a government monopoly. He achieved this goal, although partly through cutbacks in employees and mail deliveries.</p>

<p>Born in Scotland in 1964, Crozier began his career with pet food company Pedigree in 1984. He then worked at the Daily Telegraph and at advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi before joining the Football Association, England's governing body for soccer.</p>
