<h1>Floor Area Ratio - FAR</h1>

<p>The total square feet of a building divided by the total square feet of the lot the building is located on. FAR is used by local governments in zoning codes. Higher FARs tend to indicate more urban (dense) construction.</p>

<p>Buildings of varying numbers of stories can have the same FAR, because the FAR counts the total floor area of a building, not just the building's footprint. On a 4,000 square-foot lot, a 1,000 square-foot, one-story building would have the same FAR (0.25) as a two-story building where each floor was 500 square feet.</p>
