<h1>Over-55 Home Sale Exemption</h1>

<p>An obsolete tax law that provided homeowners over the age of 55 with a one-time capital gains exclusion. Individuals who met the necessary requirements could exclude up to $125,000 of capital gains on the sale of their personal residences. The exclusion was intended to stimulate the real estate market and reward homeowners for their purchase and subsequent sale.</p>

<p>The over-55 home sale exemption was superceded by provisions in the 1997 Tax Reform Act. This act raised the amount of excludable gain to $250,000 per taxpayer, and also allowed for more than one exclusion per taxpayer per lifetime.</p>
