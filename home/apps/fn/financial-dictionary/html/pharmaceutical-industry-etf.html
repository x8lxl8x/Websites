<h1>Pharmaceutical Industry ETF</h1>

<p>A sector-following fund that invests in developers and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, with the objective of matching the investment performance of an underlying pharmaceutical index. Since it invests largely in drug companies, a pharmaceutical ETF has a narrower focus than a broad healthcare ETF.</p>

<p>While an ETF may hold stocks either in proportion to their weight in an underlying index or in equal weights, this distinction is especially critical for a pharmaceutical ETF. By giving smaller companies the same percentage weighting as large companies, an equal-weighted pharmaceutical ETF may tend to outperform an ETF that is heavily concentrated in the mega-cap companies.</p>
