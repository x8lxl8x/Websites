<h1>Discount Broker</h1>

<p>A stockbroker who carries out buy and sell orders at a reduced commission compared to a full-service broker, but provides no investment advice.</p>

<p>It used to be that only the wealthy could afford a broker and access to the stock market. The internet has brought an explosion of discount brokers which let you trade at a smaller fee. However, it is important to remember that discount brokers don't provide personalized advice. Because of discount brokers, nearly anybody can afford to invest in the market.</p>

<p>For those who wish to do their own research or don't want to invest a lot of money, a discount broker is an excellent way to invest.</p>
