<h1>Assets Under Administration - AUA</h1>

<p>Financial properties that are managed by a bank or financial institution on behalf of clients. Assets under administration are beneficially owned by clients, and all investment decisions pertaining to these assets are also made by clients. Services offered by asset administration providers include custodial and tax-related duties.</p>

<p>Assets under administration are a common measure of  the size of an institution's custodial portfolio, with the largest banks and financial institutions that offer these services having hundreds of billions of dollars in such assets.</p>

<p>Assets under administration are distinct from assets under management (AUM), which refers to assets that are actively managed by fund managers and portfolio managers on behalf of investors.</p>
