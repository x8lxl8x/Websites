<h1>Delayed Draw Term Loan</h1>

<p>A special feature in a term loan that stipulates that the borrower can withdraw predefined amounts of the total pre-approved amount of a term loan at contractual times. This special type of term loan is only offered to individuals and firms that meet and maintain certain contractual requirements and have outstanding credit ratings.</p>

<p>There are different types of contractual caveats the borrower must meet, such as maintaining a certain level of cash on hand or maintaining a minimum quick ratio factor. Any contractual obligations will limit the borrower from performing some particular acts, such as over leveraging, but they are still considered a flexible feature for a term loan.</p>
