<h1>Unchanged</h1>

<p>A situation in which the price or rate of a security does not change between two periods. This can be over any time frame including a trading day, week, or even as much as a year.</p>

<p>Sometimes seen as "UNCH."
For example, assume that the closing price of ABC stock on Tuesday was $13.50 and on Wednesday the price also closed at $13.50. During this period, the price of ABC stock is referred to as being unchanged, even though the price of the stock likely fluctuated during the day.           </p>
