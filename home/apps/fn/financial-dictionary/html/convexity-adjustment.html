<h1>Convexity Adjustment</h1>

<p>The change required to be made to a forward interest rate or yield to get the expected future interest rate or yield. Convexity adjustment refers to the difference between the forward interest rate and the future interest rate; this difference has to be added to the former to arrive at the latter. The need for this adjustment arises because of the non-liner relationship between bond prices and yields.</p>

<p>An adjustment for convexity is often necessary when pricing bonds, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. This adjustment is required because of the unsymmetrical change in the price of a bond in relation to changes in interest rates or yields. In other words, the percentage increase in the price of a bond for a defined decrease in rates or yields, is always more than the decline in the bond price for the same increase in rates or yields. A number of factors influence the convexity of a bond, including its coupon rate, duration, maturity and current price.</p>
