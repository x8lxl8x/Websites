<h1>Macroeconomic Factor</h1>

<p>A factor that is pertinent to a broad economy at the regional or national level and affects a large population rather than a few select individuals. Macroeconomic factors such as economic output, unemployment, inflation, savings and investment are key indicators of economic performance and are closely monitored by governments, businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>The interplay or relationship between various macroeconomic factors is the subject of a great deal of study in the field of macroeconomics. While macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole, microeconomics is concerned with the study of individual agents such as consumers and businesses and their economic decision-making.</p>
