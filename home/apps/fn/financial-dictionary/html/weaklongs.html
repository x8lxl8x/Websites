<h1>Weak Longs</h1>

<p>Refers to the group of investors that holds a long position and is quick to exit that position at the first sign of weakness. This group of investors is generally looking to capture the potential upside in a given security, but is not willing to take much loss. These investors will quickly close their positions when a trade does not work in their favor.</p>

<p>Weak longs are regarded as the opposite of true long-term investors because they are not willing to hold their positions through all types of fluctuations. Weak longs are generally short-term traders who are looking for a quick profit. When the situation is not looking good, they will close their positions and go looking for opportunities elsewhere.</p>
