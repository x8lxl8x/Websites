<h1>Target Market</h1>

<p>The consumers a company wants to sell its products and services to, and to whom it directs its marketing efforts. Identifying the target market is an essential step in the development of a marketing plan. A target market can be separated from the market as a whole by geography, buying power and demographics, as well as by psychographics.</p>

<p>Not all products and services are meant for all types of consumers. In fact, companies may tweak certain aspects of a product, such as the amount of sugar in a soft drink, so that it is more likely to be purchased by consumers with varying tastes. Creating the target market may require the use of limited product roll-outs and focus groups, allowing product managers to get a feel for which aspects of the product are the strongest.</p>
