<h1>Trillion Cubic Feet - Tcf</h1>

<p>A volume measurement used by the oil and gas industry. A trillion cubic feet (1,000,000,000,000 cubic feet) is a volume measurement of natural gas that is equivalent to approximately one Quad. A Quad is an abbreviation for a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) Btu's. A Btu (British Thermal Unit) is a unit of measurement for energy, representing the amount of heat that is needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Trillion cubic feet is commonly called abbreviated Tcf. Similarly, Bcf refers to a billion cubic feet, a gas measurement equal to approximately one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) Btu's. Mcf stands for one thousand cubic feet, a measure that is used more commonly in the low volume segments of the gas industry, such as stripper well production.</p>

<p>Within the oil and gas industry, units of measurement are represented by letters where M= one thousand, MM = one million, B = one billion and T = one trillion. Any of these can appear before certain terms, such as MMBOE (million barrel of oil equivalent) or Tcf (trillion cubic feet).</p>
