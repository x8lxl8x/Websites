<h1>Special Tax Bond</h1>

<p>A type of bond that is repaid by revenues derived from taxation of a particular activity or asset. These bonds are repaid with either excise taxes, special assessment taxes or ad valorem taxes.
For example, say a special tax bond is be issued to fund the building of a new hospital wing dedicated to the treatment of cancer. An excise tax levied on cigarettes at the point of sale would be used to pay the debt to bondholders.</p>

<p>Another example of a project for which a special tax bond may be issued is the building of a new freeway. People who live in areas would be assessed an increased property tax based on their likelihood of using the new road.</p>
