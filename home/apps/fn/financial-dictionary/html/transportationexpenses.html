<h1>Transportation Expenses</h1>

<p>An expense incurred by an employee or self-employed taxpayer while away from home in a travel status for business. Travel expenses are costs associated with business travel, such as taxi fares, meals and lodging. These expenses can be used as tax deductions for businesses and self-employed individuals when filing tax returns.</p>

<p>Travel expenses may only be claimed if the transportation expenses are directly related to the primary business in which the individual works. For example, claiming transportation costs when you have not actually done any traveling for the business is not allowed and can be viewed as a form of tax fraud.</p>
