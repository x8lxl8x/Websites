<h1>Advisor Account</h1>

<p>A type of investment account where an investment advisor works closely with a client in formulating and implementing investment purchases and strategies. In most cases, the client has the final say on all investment decisions.</p>

<p>The fee structure of an advisor account is typically asset-based, in which the annual fee paid by the client is based on a percent of the assets held in the account. There are no trading commission fees.</p>

<p>These types of accounts are generally for investors who would like to take a hands-on approach to their investments but would also like to work with a financial expert. In addition to working with an investment advisor, the client will often have access to a wide range of investments, including IPO stock and lower cost mutual funds.</p>
