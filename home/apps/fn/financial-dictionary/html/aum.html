<h1>Assets Under Management - AUM</h1>

<p>The market value of assets that an investment company manages on behalf of investors. Assets under management (AUM) is looked at as a measure of success against the competition and consists of growth/decline due to both capital appreciation/losses and new money inflow/outflow.</p>

<p>There are widely differing views on what "assets under management" refers to. Some financial institutions include bank deposits, mutual funds and institutional money in their calculations; others limit it to funds under discretionary management, where the client delegates responsibility to the company.</p>
