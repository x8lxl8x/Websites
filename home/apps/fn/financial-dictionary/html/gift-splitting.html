<h1>Gift Splitting</h1>

<p>A taxation rule that allows a married couple to split a gift's total value as if each contributed half of the amount. Gift splitting allows a couple to increase their total gift tax exemption amount by combining individual allowances.</p>

<p>For gift splitting to be official, both spouses must agree to the gift and specify the situation when filing taxes. In 2011, the gift tax exemption was set at $13,000 per individual gift annually. Gift splitting allows a couple to donate a total of $26,000 before being taxed on the contribution.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you want to give your child $20,000 to purchase a vehicle. If you make the gift alone, $7,000 ($20,000-$13,000) will be subject to gift taxes. However, if you split the gift with your spouse, with each of you contributing $10,000, both contributions will fall under the $13,000 limit, making the entire gift non-taxable.</p>
