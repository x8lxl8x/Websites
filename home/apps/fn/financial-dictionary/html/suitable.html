<h1>Suitable (Suitability)</h1>

<p>A situation (and sometimes a legal requirement) that an investment strategy meets the objectives and means of an investor. In most parts of the world financial professionals have a duty to take steps that ensure that an investment is suitable for a client. For example, in the United States these rules are enforced by the NASD.</p>

<p>In other words: is an investment appropriate for an investor? No investment (other than outright scams) are inherently suitable or unsuitable, it depends on the investor's situation. For example, for a 95 year old widow living on a fixed income, speculative investments such as options and futures, penny stocks, etc. are extremely unsuitable because the widow has a low risk tolerance. On the other hand, an executive with significant net worth and investing experience might be comfortable taking on those speculative investments as part of his/her portfolio.</p>
