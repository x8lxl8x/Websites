<h1>B1/B+</h1>

<p>Usually the lowest investment grade rating assigned to a security or insurance carrier. This rating signifies that the issuer or carrier is relatively stable with a moderate chance of default. Investors and policyholders of the rated entity are taking a low to medium risk.</p>

<p>The ratings assigned by the various ratings agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can therefore be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of default. However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.</p>
