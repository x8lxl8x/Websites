<h1>Record Low</h1>

<p>The lowest historical price level reached by a security, commodity or index during trading. A record low can be reached during a trading day, and is recorded regardless of whether it is the closing price. Record lows tend to be nominal values, which do not account for inflation.</p>

<p>Hitting an all-time record low is usually bad news for a publicly traded company. While some investors may be tempted into buying at such a low price, most buyers will be less optimistic about the situation and shy away from the stock. Companies who constantly hit record lows will typically struggle to rebound in value.</p>
