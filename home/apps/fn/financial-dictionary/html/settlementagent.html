<p>2. A real estate professional who functions chiefly for the buyer by conveying the selling interest from the buyer to the seller and ensuring the orderly transfer of the legal title from the seller to the buyer through the closing process.</p>

<p>Also known as a "closing agent" or "conveyancer".</p>
