<h1>Sideways Trend</h1>

<p>Describes the horizontal price movement that occurs when the forces of supply and demand are nearly equal. A sideways trend is often regarded as a period of consolidation before the price continues in the direction of the previous move.</p>

<p>A sideways price trend is also commonly known as a "horizontal trend".</p>

<p>Sideways trend is generally a result of the price traveling between strong levels of support and resistance. It is not uncommon to see a horizontal trend dominate the price action of a specific asset for a prolonged period before starting a move higher or lower. Brief consolidation is often needed during large price runs, as it is nearly impossible for such large price moves to sustain themselves over the longer term.</p>
