<h1>Contingent Value Rights - CVR</h1>

<p>A type of right given to shareholders of an acquired company (or a company facing major restructuring) that ensures they receive additional benefit if a specified event occurs. A contingent value right is similar to an option because it often has an expiration date that relates to the time the contingent event must occur.</p>

<p>For example, shareholders of an acquired company may receive a CVR that enables them to receive additional shares of the target company in the event that target company's share price falls below a certain level by a specified date.</p>

<p>Another example of a CVR would be for a target company to set aside a large sum of money that would be transferred to the shareholders of the acquired company in the event that the price of the target company's shares do not meet a certain target or fall below a specified price.</p>
