<h1>Gifting Phase</h1>

<p>The stage in an investor's life where he or she seeks to use his or her accumulated wealth to provide for the current and future needs of family and friends, as well as to leave a mark on the world by funding charities of his or her choice through philanthropy. The investor's concerns during this phase shift from matters of capital accumulation to estate planning and tax minimization.</p>

<p>While investing is indeed all about making money, the gifting phase of a successful investor's life can be the most personally fulfilling reward for a commitment to long-term investing.  Many prominent investors who were aggressive capitalists in their heyday have gone on to be great philanthropists: for example, the infamous Michael Milken, who made a fortune in the junk bond market in the 1980s but now donates large amounts of money to support prostate cancer research.</p>
