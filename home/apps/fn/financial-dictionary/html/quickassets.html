<h1>Quick Assets</h1>

<p>Anything having commercial or exchange value that can easily be converted into cash, or that is already in cash form. Quick assets are the highly liquid assets held by a company, including cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Quick assets are often calculated as current assets (cash + marketable securities + accounts receivable) minus inventories (since inventories are often a firm's least-liquid current assets). Quick assets are used by companies to calculate certain financial ratios that are used in decision making, including the quick ratio.</p>

<p>The quick ratio (sometimes called the quick asset ratio or "acid test") is a financial ratio that divides a company's cash + marketable securities + accounts receivable by its current liabilities.</p>

<p>By keeping inventories out of the equation, the quick ratio allows the company to focus on its quick assets - those that could be quickly converted to cash - and helps the company determine if it could meet its financial obligations if sales (and revenues) were to cease.</p>

<p>The current ratio, on the other hand, is equal to current assets (including inventories and any assets that could be converted into cash within a "normal" 12-month operating period) divided by current liabilities.</p>
