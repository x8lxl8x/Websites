<h1>Applied Economics</h1>

<p>The application of economic theories and principles to real world situations with the desired aim of predicting potential outcomes. The use of applied economics is designed to analytically review potential outcomes without the "noise" associated with explanations that are not backed by numbers. Applied economics can involve the use of econometrics and case studies.</p>

<p>Because economics relies on the interpretation of historical events in its theories, applied economics can lead to "to do" lists for steps that can be taken to ensure stability in real world events. Although applied economics uses economic theory and principles, it is itself not a field of economics, such as neoclassical economics or the Austrian school.</p>
