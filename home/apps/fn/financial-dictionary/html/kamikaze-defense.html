<h1>Kamikaze Defense </h1>

<p>A type of takeover defense mechanism sometimes resorted to by a company that is the target of a hostile bid. Kamikaze defense involves reshaping the target company - either by divesting substantial assets or by making unappealing acquisitions - so that its attraction to a corporate raider is greatly reduced. Kamikaze defense mechanisms include such aptly-named strategies as the "scorched earth" tactic, the "sale of crown jewels" strategy and the "fatman" maneuver.</p>

<p>Since they can inflict irreparable harm upon the target company, kamikaze defenses can be considered as strategies of last resort to prevent it from falling into hostile hands. The name is derived from the tactics used by Japanese suicide pilots in World War II.</p>
