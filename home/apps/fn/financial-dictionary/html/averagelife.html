<h1>Average Life</h1>

<p>The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding. Average life is an average period before a debt is repaid through amortization or sinking fund payments. To calculate the average life, multiply the date of each payment (expressed as a fraction of years or months) by the percentage of total principal that has been paid by that date, summing the results and dividing by the total issue size.</p>

<p>Also called "weighted average maturity" and "weighted average life."</p>

<p>Average life is calculated to determine how long it will take to pay the outstanding principal of a debt issue such as a t-bill or bond. For example, assume an annual-pay, four-year bond has a face value of $200 and principal payments of $80 during the first year, $60 for the second year, $40 during the third year and $20 for the fourth (and final) year. The average life for this bond would be calculated as:</p>

<p>Average life = 400 / 200 = 2 years. This bond would have an average life of two years against its maturity of four years.</p>
