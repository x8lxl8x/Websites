<h1>Takaful</h1>

<p>A type of Islamic insurance, where members contribute money into a pooling system in order to guarantee each other against loss or damage. Takaful-branded insurance is based on Sharia, Islamic religious law, and explains how it is the responsibility of individuals to cooperate and protect each other.</p>

<p>Takaful insurance companies were introduced as an alternative to commercial insurance companies, which go against the riba (interest), al-maisir (gambling), and al-gharar (uncertainty) principles, that are outlawed in Sharia.</p>
