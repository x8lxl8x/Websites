<h1>Debt-Adjusted Cash Flow - DACF</h1>

<p>A financial ratio commonly used in the analysis of oil companies, representing the after-tax operating cash flow, excluding financial expenses after taxes.</p>

<p>Debt-adjusted cash flow (DACF) is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>DACF = cash flow from operations + financing costs (after tax) + exploration expenses (before tax) +/- working capital adjustment</p>

<p>DACF is often used in the financial ratio EV/DACF, where EV is the enterprise value of the company being analyzed. This ratio is used in place of EV/EBITDA as a valuation ratio. This ratio is good for use in the oil industry because it is an after-tax calculation (good for an industry with high resource taxes) and independent of companies' financing decisions.</p>
