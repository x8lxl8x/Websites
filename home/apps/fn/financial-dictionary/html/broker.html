<h1>Broker</h1>

<p>1. An individual or firm that charges a fee or commission for executing buy and sell orders submitted by an investor.</p>

<p>2. The role of a firm when it acts as an agent for a customer and charges the customer a commission for its services.</p>

<p>3. A licensed real estate professional who typically represents the seller of a property. A broker's duties may include: determining market values, advertising properties for sale, showing properties to prospective buyers, and advising clients with regard to offers and related matters.</p>

<p>Traditionally, only the wealthy could afford a broker and access the stock market. The internet triggered an explosion of discount brokers, which allow investors to trade at a lower cost, but don't provide personalized advice. Because of discount brokers, almost anybody can afford to invest in the market.</p>
