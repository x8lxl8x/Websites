<h1>Deficit Net Worth</h1>

<p>A scenario in which liabilities are higher than assets. Deficit net worth can occur for a variety of reasons, but typically it arises when current or future asset values erode unexpectedly. For example, when home values fall, often one is left owing more on their mortgage than the home is presently worth. Likewise, in frontier days, land and property often gained or lost value suddenly depending on where the nearest railroad was located. Also known as negative net worth.</p>

<p>A negative, or deficit, net worth does not necessarily imply bankruptcy. Just as quickly as asset values can plunge, they can also rise. However, a deficit net worth can negatively influence future financing opportunities and stifle future business growth.</p>
