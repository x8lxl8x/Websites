<h1>SEC Form 8-A12G</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Registration for Listing of a Security on a National Exchange Form, required when a company issues certain stock or bond securities, including warrants and convertible bonds. Information required on Form 8-A12G includes the type of security, its terms (par value, interest rate, maturity, etc), as well as contact information for the issuing company. Related forms: SEC Forms 8-A12G/A, 8-A12B, 8-A12B/A</p>

<p>SEC Form 8-A12G can be very helpful to investors choosing between the purchase of different classes of a company's stock or bond issues. Because a company's additional classes of securities often do not receive the same level of coverage as their common stock, this form can help investors to gather important decision-making information.</p>
