<h1>Value</h1>

<p>The monetary, material or assessed worth of an asset, good or service. In accounting, value describes what something is worth in terms of something else. For example, the value of a loaf of bread might be $3; the $3 for the loaf of bread would represent the generally accepted worth of the bread.</p>

<p>In economics, value describes the merit of the benefits of ownership. The benefits of ownership include utility, the pleasure or satisfaction gained by consumption of a particular good or service; and power, the ability of a good or service to be exchanged for other goods, services or money.</p>

<p>Value is used to quantify the worth of something, and different types of value can be applied to explain various situations. For example, the value of a company can be described in terms of its intrinsic value, book value, actual cash value or market value.</p>

<p>Value can be perceived, as in the way consumers perceive the ability of a good or service to meet their needs and their willingness to pay for the good or service.</p>

<p>The value of an asset, good or service can change over time. For example, the price of a security fluctuates.</p>

<p>Value can also relate to how people feel about something, describing how something is regarded and its importance to the individual. For example, a memento may have very little monetary value but have significant sentimental value.</p>
