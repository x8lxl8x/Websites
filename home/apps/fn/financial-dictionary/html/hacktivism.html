<h1>Hacktivism</h1>

<p>A social or political activist plan that is carried out by breaking into and wreaking havoc on a secure computer system. Hacktivism may be directed at corporate or government targets. Examples of hacktivism include denial of service attacks, which shut down a system to prevent customer access, software that enables users to access censored web pages, and the leaking of sensitive information.</p>

<p>The methods hacktivists use are illegal and are a form of cybercrime. Hacktivists exploit flaws in many organizations' computer systems. Hacktivism poses a threat not only to the organizations that are attacked, but also to the consumers and citizens whose sensitive data are stored by those organizations. LulzSec and Anonymous are two well-known hacktivist groups whose activities have made headlines.</p>
