<h1>Relationship Manager</h1>

<p>A professional who works to improve a firm's relationships with both partner firms and customers. Relationship management is generally divided into two fields: customer relationship management (CRM) and business relationship management (BRM). Both fields share the common goal of facilitating good relationships such that the business maximizes the value of its relationships and maintains a good reputation overall.</p>

<p>Relationships have traditionally been regarded as an intangible aspect of business that was inherently difficult to assess or manage. Relationship managers are part of a movement that seeks to use a scientific approach to gain greater control over business relationships. Relationship managers seek to define, quantify and analyze relationships so that they are not left up to chance.</p>
