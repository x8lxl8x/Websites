<h1>Mortgage Bond</h1>

<p>A bond secured by a mortgage on one or more assets. These bonds are typically backed by real estate holdings and/or real property such as equipment. In a default situation, mortgage bondholders have a claim to the underlying property and could sell it off to compensate for the default.</p>

<p>Mortgage bonds offer the investor a great deal of protection in that the principal is secured by a valuable asset that could theoretically be sold off to cover the debt. However, because of this inherent safety, the average mortgage bond tends to yield a lower rate of return than traditional corporate bonds that are backed only by the corporation's promise and ability to pay.</p>
