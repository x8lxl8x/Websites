<h1>Net-Net</h1>

<p>A value investing technique in which a company is valued solely on its net current assets. The net-net investing method focuses on current assets, taking cash and cash equivalents at full value, reducing accounts receivable for doubtful accounts, and reducing inventories to liquidation values. Total liabilities are then deducted from the adjusted current assets to get the company's net-net value. This method was introduced by Benjamin Graham</p>

<p>Graham used this method back when financial information was not as readily available, valuations as a whole were very low and net-nets were much more prevalent in the market. When a viable company is identified as a net-net, it is about as close to a sure thing as you can get in the markets. These special occurrences are now basically non-existent in the market, but Graham's theories on valuing a company based on tangible assets remain useful.</p>
