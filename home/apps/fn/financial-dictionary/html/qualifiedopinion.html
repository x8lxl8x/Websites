<h1>Qualified Opinion</h1>

<p>A statement written upon the front page of an audit done by a professional auditor. A qualified opinion suggests that the information provided was limited in scope and/or the company being audited has not maintained GAAP accounting principles.
Contrary to its connotation, a qualified opinion is not a good thing. Auditors that deem audits as qualified opinions are advising whomever is reading the document that the information within the audit is not complete or that the accounting methods used by the company do not follow GAAP.            </p>
