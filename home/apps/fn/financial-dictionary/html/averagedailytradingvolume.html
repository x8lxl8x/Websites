<h1>Average Daily Trading Volume - ADTV</h1>

<p>The average amount of individual securities traded in a day or over a specified amount of time. Trading activity relates to the liquidity of a security; therefore, when average daily trading volume is high, the stock can be easily traded and has high liquidity. As a result, average daily trading volume can have an effect on the price of the security. If trading volume isn't very high, the security will tend to be less expensive because people are not as willing to buy it.</p>

<p>When average daily trading volume increases or decreases dramatically, this is a signal that there has been some news released that has affected people's views on the security. Usually, higher average daily trading volumes mean that the security is more competitive, has narrower spreads and is typically less volatile. Stocks are less volatile when they have higher average daily trading volumes because much larger trades would have to be made to have an effect on the price.</p>
