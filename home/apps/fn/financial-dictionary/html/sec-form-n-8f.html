<h1>SEC Form N-8F</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be submitted by a currently registered investment company that is seeking to deregister. To use the SEC Form N-8F, the fund must have undergone a merger or liquidation, qualify for abandonment of registration, or have become a business development company.</p>

<p>SEC Form N-8F is also known as "Application for Deregistration of Certain Registered Investment Companies." It is required under Section 8F of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The purpose of this filing is for the SEC to determine that a registered investment company has ceased to be an investment company.</p>

<p>This filing identifies the reason the company is applying to deregister, the fund's classification, and information about the fund's advisers, underwriters, distribution of funds to shareholders, assets and liabilities, and events leading to the request for deregistration.</p>
