<h1>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) </h1>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in December 1970 under United States President Richard Nixon. The EPA is an agency of the United States federal government whose mission is to protect human and environmental health. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the EPA is responsible for conducting environmental assessment, research and education to create and enforce standards and laws that will promote the health of individuals and the environment.</p>

<p>The Environment Protection Agency seeks to protect and conserve the natural environment and improve the health of humans by researching the effects and mandating limits of chemicals and other pollutants. The EPA regulates the manufacturing, processing, distribution and use of chemicals and other pollutants. In addition, the EPA is charged with determining safe tolerance levels for chemicals and other pollutants in food, animal feed and water. The EPA is able to enforce its findings through fines, sanctions and other procedures.</p>
