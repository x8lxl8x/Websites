<h1>Multiline Insurance</h1>

<p>An insurance instrument used to bundle the risk exposures of multiple insurance obligations into one insurance contract. The risk exposures put together often are related, such as property and casualty risks.</p>

<p>Many different varieties of multiline contracts exist, and they cover a wide range of risk exposures. The basis behind multiline contracts is that a firm often is exposed to a portfolio of risk, and instead of creating a portfolio of insurance policies to manage that risk, they should use a single multiline contract to manage the portfolio of risks. One insurance contract is then more efficient and less costly than many contracts.           </p>
