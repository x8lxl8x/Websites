<h1>Series 79 </h1>

<p>A examination to ensure a candidate is qualified to become a Limited Representative -  Investment Banker. The Series 79 exam is administered by the Financial Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and ensures those looking for positions in investment banking have adequate knowledge in mergers & acquisitions, buyouts, financial restructuring, public investment banking and refinancing. Those looking to write the exam must be sponsored by a FINRA member firm.</p>

<p>The Series 79 exam is intended for investment bankers whose skills are more specific than those provided by the broader Series 7 exam. New rules were enacted in 2009 to better prepare individuals specifically for investment banking activities or supervision of these activities.</p>

<p>The exam focuses on four different areas:
1. Collection, Analysis and Evaluation of Data
2. Underwriting/New Financing Transactions, Types of Offerings and Registration Of Securities
3. Merger and Acquisitions, Tender Offers and Financial Restructuring Transactions
4. General Securities Industry Regulations</p>

<p>These areas are deemed to be important for succeeding in a Limited Representative -  Investment Banker role.</p>
