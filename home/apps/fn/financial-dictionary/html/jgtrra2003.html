<h1>Jobs And Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003</h1>

<p>An act passed by congress that was intended to improve the economy of the United States by reducing the taxes collected, giving the population more money to spend. The act was passed in May 2003 and signed into law shortly after.
The passing of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 lowered the tax rate applied to dividend income by making this income count as capital gains instead of as a part of normal income. The act also simplified rules relating to qualifying retirement plans and increased the personal tax exemption amount of the 'alternative minimum tax'.           </p>
