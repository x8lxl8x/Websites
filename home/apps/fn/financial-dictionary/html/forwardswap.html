<h1>Forward Swap</h1>

<p>A swap agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a "forward start swap," "delayed start swap," and a "deferred start swap."</p>

<p>For example, if an investor wants to hedge for a five-year duration beginning one year from today, this investor can enter into both a one-year and six-year swap, creating the forward swap that meets the needs of his or her portfolio. Sometimes swaps don't perfectly match the needs of investors wishing to hedge certain risks.</p>
