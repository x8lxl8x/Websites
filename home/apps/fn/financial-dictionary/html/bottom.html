<h1>Bottom</h1>

<p>The lowest point or price reached by a financial security, commodity, index or economic cycle in a given time period. A specific time span is usually used to determine a bottom - most commonly, 52 weeks - but that timeframe could stretch over years, or remain intraday.</p>

<p>If a stock has "bottomed out", it means it might have reached its low point and could be in the early stages of an upward trend. Investors usually see a bottom as an opportunity to purchase securities when they are potentially underpriced.</p>

<p>The bottom is used in technical analysis by defining the lowest level of support when charting a stock, commodity, index or economic cycle.</p>
