<h1>Real Economic Growth Rate</h1>

<p>A measure of economic growth from one period to another expressed as a percentage and  adjusted for inflation (i.e. expressed in real as opposed to nominal terms). The real economic growth rate is a measure of the rate of change that a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) experiences from one year to another. Gross national product (GNP) can also be used if a nation's economy is heavily dependent on foreign earnings.</p>

<p>The real economic growth rate builds onto the economic growth rate by taking into account the effect that inflation has on the economy. The real economic growth rate is a "constant dollar" and is therefore a more accurate look at the rate of economic growth because it is not distorted by the effects of extreme inflation or deflation.</p>
