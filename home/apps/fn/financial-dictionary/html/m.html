<h1>M</h1>

<p>The fifth letter of a Nasdaq stock symbol that specifies the issue is the firm's fourth class of preferred shares. Securities that are listed on the Nasdaq exchange have four or five letters.</p>

<p>When a fifth letter appears, it identifies the issue as being one that is other than a single issue of common stock or capital stock. A "P" indicates that the issue is the company's first class of preferred shares; an "O" indicates that the issue is the company's second class of preferred shares; "N" indicates the third class of preferred shares. "M" indicates the fourth class.</p>

<p>Preferred shares give holders a class of ownership that has a higher claim on assets and earnings than holders of the company's common stock. Dividends for preferred shares are paid out before dividends to common stockholders.</p>

<p>However, preferred shareholders generally do not have any voting rights. Dividends for preferred shares are fixed; that is, they do not fluctuate like the dividends for the company's common shares. Nasdaq symbols utilize other fifth-letter identifiers such as "A" for class A shares; "B" for class B shares, "C" for issuer qualification exception; "D" for new issue; "E" for delinquent.</p>
