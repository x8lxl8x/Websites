<h1>Capital Tax</h1>

<p>A tax on a corporation's taxable capital, comprising capital stock, surpluses, indebtedness and reserves. Capital tax is applicable to capital owned by a company, not its spending. Capital taxes, in contrast to income taxes, are charged regardless of the profitability of the firm.
Also known as "corporation capital tax".</p>

<p>In British Columbia, the corporation capital tax (CCT) is a tax levied on financial corporations with a permanent establishment in British Columbia and net paid-up capital in excess of a minimum threshold amount. For the purposes of the CCT, a financial corporation is a bank, trust company, credit union or loan corporation.</p>
