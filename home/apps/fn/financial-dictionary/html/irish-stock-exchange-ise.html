<h1>Irish Stock Exchange â€“ ISE</h1>

<p>A stock exchange located in Ireland. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has existed since 1793 and was first recognized by legislation in 1799, following the Irish Parliament's passing of the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act. The Irish Stock Exchange merged with other British and Irish stock exchanges in 1973, then becoming part of the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland. This merger is now called the London Stock Exchange. After more than two decades, the Irish Stock Exchange became once again independent in 1995. Its registered office is in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<p>The Irish Stock Exchange is a member of the World Federation of Exchanges, as well as the Federation of European Stock Exchanges. It is regulated by the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the regulation and supervision of Ireland's authorized Regulated Markets and Market Operators. Formally called the Irish Stock Exchange Limited, it is an Irish private company limited by guarantee and legal structure, that was assumed in 1995. It has a Board of thirteen directors, whose appointments are subject to the approval of the Financial Regulator.</p>
