<h1>Owner-Occupant</h1>

<p>A resident of a property who also holds the title to that property. In contrast, an absentee owner holds title to the property but does not live there. A landlord is a type of absentee owner.</p>

<p>When applying for a mortgage or refinance, the lender will want to know if the borrower is going to be an owner occupant or an absentee owner. The application will usually say "The borrower intends to occupy the property as his/her primary residence", (or some variation thereof) when the borrower will be an owner-occupant. Some types of loans may only be available to owner-occupants and not to investors.</p>
