<h1>Megamerger</h1>

<p>The joining of two large corporations, typically involving billions of dollars in value. The megamerger creates one corporation that may maintain control over a large percentage of market share within its industry.</p>

<p>Megamergers occur through the acquisition, merger, consolidation or combination of two existing corporations. Megamergers differ from traditional mergers due to their scale.</p>

<p>Megamergers in the recent past have included Pfizer's $68 billion deal for Wyeth (2009), Kraft's nearly $20 billion deal for Cadbury (2010) and the United-Continental merger (2010), which created the world's largest airline.</p>

<p>The first megamerger took place in 1901, when Carnegie Steel Corporation combined with its main rivals to form United States Steel.</p>
