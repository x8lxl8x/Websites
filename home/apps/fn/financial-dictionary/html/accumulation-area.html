<h1>Accumulation Area</h1>

<p>A price range in which investors typically purchase shares of a particular stock. The accumulation area is determined by looking at the volume and its corresponding price. It  appears as a rectangle with a price line bouncing up and down between the upper and lower limits. According to technical analysts, stocks that hit the accumulation area presents an opportunity to buy because it is expected to attract more demand.</p>

<p>Investors use technical analysis techniques, such as the on-balance volume (OBV) method, to detect the momentum of a stock. If a stock doesn't seem to fall below a certain price, this can be a sign that the stock is in an accumulation area and may be more likely to attract more investors, allowing traders who see the trend to profit from increased buyer interest.</p>
