<h1>Nonrecurring Charge</h1>

<p>An entry that appears on a company's financial statements for a one-time expense that is unlikely to happen again. A nonrecurring charge is a one-time charge for an unpredictable event.</p>

<p>Also known as a nonrecurring item.</p>

<p>Nonrecurring charges appear on a company's financial statements under operating expenses. The company's earnings are correspondingly reduced for the time period shown in the financial statement; however, notations will make it clear that the nonrecurring charge is for a one-time, unusual event, and should not be considered an expense that the company will be exposed to again in the future. An example of a nonrecurring charge would be costs associated with replacing windows following a natural disaster.</p>
