<h1>SEC Form N-30B-2</h1>

<p>A form filed with the SEC that applies to investment companies (mutual funds). SEC Form N-30B-2 informs the SEC that the company is current with the mailing of periodic and interim reports, such as quarterly reports, to shareholders of mutual funds.</p>

<p>Quarterly reports, as well as semi-annual and annual reports, are important to mutual fund shareholders. Shareholders can see what fees and management costs the fund company is charging them. Shareholders can also track the fund's performance and see what securities are in the fund's portfolio.</p>
