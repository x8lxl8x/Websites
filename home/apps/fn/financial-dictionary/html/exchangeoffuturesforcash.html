<h1>Exchange of Futures for Cash</h1>

<p>A method by which opposite parties of a futures contract that has underlying cash commodities aim to close out their positions simultaneously. Also know as exchange for physicals (EFP).
This process is similar to a swap and can be completed in two ways:</p>

<p>1. Through a transfer of a corresponding quantity of long futures contracts from the buyer of the commodity to the seller.</p>

<p>2. Through a transfer of a corresponding quantity of short futures contracts from the seller of the commodity to the buyer.</p>

<p>In both instances, the transfer of the futures contracts must be done at a price that is mutually agreed upon.          </p>
