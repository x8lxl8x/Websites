<h1>Stock Savings Plan</h1>

<p>In Canada, a plan wherein certain provinces (such as Alberta, Ontario and Quebec) provide tax credits for provincial income taxes to residents who purchase certain investments, in particular the initial public offerings (IPOs) of local companies. Stock savings plans provide tax benefits to Canadian residents and are intended to encourage residents to invest in the provincial economy. Each Canadian province has its own unique stock savings plan.</p>

<p>The Quebec Stock Savings Plan, for example, is the plan for the Canadian province of Quebec. This particular plan provides tax benefits to Quebec residents who buy new issues of stock from local Quebec companies. In March 2012, stocks of Nemaska Lithium, an exploration and development company in Quebec's James Bay Region, were listed as "valid shares" and qualified for the province's stock savings plan.</p>
