<h1>Investment Real Estate</h1>

<p>Real estate that generates income or is otherwise intended for investment purposes rather than as a primary residence. It is common for investors to own multiple pieces of real estate, one of which serves as a primary residence, while the others are used to generate rental income and profits through price appreciation. The tax implications for investment real estate are often different than those for residential real estate.</p>

<p>Common examples of investment properties are apartment buildings and rental houses, in which the owners do not live in the residential units, but use them to generate ongoing rental income from tenants. Those who invest in real estate also expect to generate capital gains as property values increase over time.</p>
