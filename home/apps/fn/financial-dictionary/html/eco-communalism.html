<h1>Eco-Communalism</h1>

<p>An economic/environmental philosophy focused upon local economies, sustainability and self-sufficiency. Eco-communalism is centered upon the belief that many self-sufficient local economies connected to one another will be a greater benefit to society as a whole than a centralized capitalistic one. The primary principles of eco-communalism include green economics, biodiversity and decentralization of government.</p>

<p>Eco-communalists believe that the goodness of society is the key to creating a world that is less reliant on capitalistic traits and more concerned with the common good. In this vain eco-communalism is often closely associated with the ideals of eco-socialism, which is focused on moving towards a more socialist mandate and away from the materialism of modern capitalism.</p>
