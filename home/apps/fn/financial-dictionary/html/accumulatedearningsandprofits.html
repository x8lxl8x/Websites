<h1>Accumulated Earnings and Profits</h1>

<p>An accounting term applicable to stockholders of closely held businesses. Accumulated earnings and profits are a company's net profits after deducting distributions to the stockholders. This is calculated as of the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>Accumulated earnings and profits are similar to retained earnings, because both terms refer to the net profits of a company after shareholder distributions. However, accumulated earnings and profits also can include reserve accounts, which are not deductible and which can be included when computing taxable earnings.</p>
