<h1>Twinternship</h1>

<p>An internship in which the intern is charged with using social media to drive attention to a company and its products. A twinternship is usually an unpaid, temporary position in which a "twintern" will use popular social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, to publicize products and promotions for a business.</p>

<p>Also known as a "brand advocate."</p>

<p>Twinterns usually work as a part of a company's public relations team. Twinternships have gained popularity as a cheap and relatively easy way to communicate a company's brand with younger, tech-savvy consumers. Some companies have even held promotional contests to award similar paid positions to young twinternship hopefuls.</p>
