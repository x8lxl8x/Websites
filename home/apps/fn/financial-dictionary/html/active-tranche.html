<h1>Active Tranche</h1>

<p>A tranche of a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) that is currently receiving principal payments that are passed through to its investors. While interest is paid on all tranches of a CMO when it is first issued, principal payments on each tranche are made according to a set schedule that is defined in the CMO prospectus. A tranche becomes the active tranche during the period when it is receiving (and paying out to investors) principal payments as per the schedule, in addition to interest.</p>

<p>After an active tranche in a CMO receives the last principal payment, it is retired. The next tranche then becomes the active one. The process continues until all tranches in the CMO are retired.</p>
