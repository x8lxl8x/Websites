<h1>Moody's Bond Survey</h1>

<p>A weekly publication that reports changes in corporate bond quality ratings for publicly traded companies, lists new debt registrations and provides market commentary. Also known as "Moody's Credit Survey."</p>

<p>The survey reports all changes in bond ratings which occur each week and also covers assets such as preferred equity and commercial paper. Since bond prices, and thus bond yields, are affected by a corporation's bond rating, investors choosing to trade in bonds should pay close attention to any changes in corporate bond ratings affecting their holdings.</p>
