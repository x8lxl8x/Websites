<h1>Tax-Advantaged</h1>

<p>Any type of investment, account or plan that is either exempt from taxation, tax-deferred or offers other types of tax benefits. Examples of Tax-Advantaged investments are municipal bonds, partnerships, UITs and annuities. Tax-advantaged plans include IRAs and qualified plans.</p>

<p>Tax-advantaged investments and accounts are used by a wide variety of investors and employees in various financial situations. High-income taxpayers seek tax-free municipal bond income, while employees save for retirement with IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plans. Selecting the proper type of tax-advantaged accounts or investments depends on an investor's financial situation.</p>
