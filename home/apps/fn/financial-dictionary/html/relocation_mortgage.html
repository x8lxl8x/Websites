<h1>Relocation Mortgage - Relo</h1>

<p>A type of mortgage that is designed for relocating/transferring employees. Corporations sometime make special mortgages available for relocating employees in an effort to make the moving process easier and more economical. Oftentimes, there are bonuses for the employee, such as the company paying the closing costs. Some mortgage companies specialize in offering relo mortgages.</p>

<p>Historical data shows that employees who relocate for their jobs are likely to relocate repeatedly at predictable time intervals; therefore, relo mortgages have more predictable prepayment characteristics than non-relo mortgages. Because the prepayment characteristics of any mortgage-backed security (MBS) are very important to its valuation by traders, the more predictable prepayment characteristics of MBSs backed by relo mortgages allow relo MBSs to trade at a premium relative to other MBSs.</p>
