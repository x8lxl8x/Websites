<h1>Average Price</h1>

<p>1. A representative measure of a range of prices that is calculated by taking the sum of the values and dividing it by the number of prices being examined. The average price reduces the range into a single value, which can then be compared to any point to determine if the value is higher or lower than what would be expected.</p>

<p>2. A bond's average price is calculated by adding its face value to the price paid for it and dividing the sum by two. The average price is sometimes used in determining a bond's yield to maturity where the average price replaces the purchase price in the yield to maturity calculation.</p>

<p>1. In situations where there is a range of prices it can be useful to calculate the average price to  simplify a range of numbers into a single value. For example, if over a four-month period you paid $104, $105, $110, and $115 for your utilities, the average price or cost of your monthly utilities would be $108.50.</p>

<p>2. Although the average price of a bond is not the most accurate method to find its YTM, it does give investors a rough and simple gauge to find out what a bond is worth.</p>
