<h1>Article 9</h1>

<p>An article under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that governs secured transactions. Article 9 encompasses a wide variety of possessory liens and determines the legal right of ownership if a debtor does not meet his or her obligations.</p>

<p>In 2002, Article 9 was revised to substantially modernize and expand the scope of what can be used as collateral to include credit card receivables, electronic chattel paper, accounts receivable and business inventory.</p>

<p>Although Article 9 goes into great detail to incorporate the many loans secured by various types of collateral, there are still many disputes over who has ownership priority of an asset subject to a security interest transaction.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that George brings his computer to be serviced by Mike. Upon completing the repairs, George does not have the funds to pay Mike. In this case, Article 9 states that Mike may keep the computer until payment is received.</p>
