<h1>Investment Advice</h1>

<p>Any recommendation or guidance that attempts to educate, inform or guide an investor regarding a particular investment product or series of products. Investment advice can be professional; that is, the investor pays a fee in exchange for the qualified professional's guidance and expertise, as seen with financial planners; or, investment advice can be amateur in nature, as with certain internet blogs, chat rooms or even conversations.</p>

<p>Investment advice refers to any recommendations regarding an investor's portfolio. Many professionals, including financial planners, bankers and brokers, can provide investors with investment advice that is specific to their financial situation and short- and long-term financial goals. Due to the vast amount of investment advice available, particularly online, an investor may wish to determine the qualifications of the person dispensing the advice prior to making any investments. Ultimately, it is up to the individual investor to decide which investments are most suitable.</p>
