<h1>Reconstruction Finance Corporation - RFC</h1>

<p>An agency created by the the U.S. government to aid the troubled banking sector in the years following the stock market crash of 1929. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was approved by Congress to begin business in 1932 with a mandate to make emergency loans to banks that were in danger of failing.</p>

<p>Although the RFC was intended to only stay in operation for 10 years following its inception, the agency lasted until 1957. During that time the RFC expanded its authority to include making loans to farmers, railroads, companies and even created eight subsidiaries to aid in the wartime effort during World War II.</p>
