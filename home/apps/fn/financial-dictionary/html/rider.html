<h1>Rider</h1>

<p>A provision of an insurance policy that is purchased separately from the basic policy and that provides additional benefits at additional cost. Standard policies usually leave little room for modification or customization, beyond choosing deductibles and coverage amounts. Riders help policyholders create insurance products that meet their specific needs.</p>

<p>For example, an accelerated death benefit rider on a life insurance policy would provide the insured with a payout while he or she was still alive, in the event of a terminal illness. The insured could use these funds to pay for medical expenses and to increase the quality of their remaining life. When the insured passes away, their beneficiaries will receive a reduced life insurance benefit, since the rider allowed a portion of the policy to be used early.</p>
