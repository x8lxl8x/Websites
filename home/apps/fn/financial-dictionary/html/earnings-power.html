<h1>Earnings Power</h1>

<p>A business's ability to generate profit from conducting its operations. Earnings power is used to analyze stocks to assess whether the underlying company is worthy of investment. Possessing greater long-term earnings power is one indication that a stock may be a good investment.</p>

<p>Many metrics are used to solely determine a company's earnings power. For example, analyzing a company's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) determines the company's ability to generate profit from its assets and shareholder's equity, respectively.</p>

<p>Individual sectors or industries may place greater importance on certain metrics for earnings power purposes compared to others. For example, the dividend yield may be more relevant for a long-lived blue chip company compared to a rapidly growing start-up, because the start-up will more likely be investing its money back into the firm to sustain its growth rather than dispensing dividends.</p>
