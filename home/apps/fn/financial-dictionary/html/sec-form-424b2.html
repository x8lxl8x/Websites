<h1>SEC Form 424B2</h1>

<p>The prospectus form that a company must file if it is making a primary offering of securities on a delayed basis. SEC form 424B2 must include information about the security being offered, including the price set for the public offering and the method of distribution.</p>

<p>Companies are required to file prospectus form 424B2 in accordance with Rule 424(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. The act was created to help investors make informed decisions by requiring securities issuers to complete and file registration statements (including financial and material information) with the SEC before making an issue available for purchase by the public. Often registration statement filings required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 are also registration statements under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</p>
