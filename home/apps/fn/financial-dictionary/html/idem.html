<h1>Italian Derivatives Market</h1>

<p>A derivatives exchange headquartered in Milan, Italy. The Italian Derivatives Market is a part of the Borsa Italiana, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange. The IDEM allows trades of futures contracts on indices, equities and commodities such as electricity, as well as mini contracts. As many derivatives exchange across the world, the IDEM has seen a steady increase in volume over the past years.</p>

<p>The exchange dates back to the early 1800s, when it was created to replace the former Borsa di Comercio. In 2000 the IDEM, along with the Italian Stock Exchange board, went from a government controlled entity to the privately held Borsa Italia, which is responsible for the exchanges' management.</p>
