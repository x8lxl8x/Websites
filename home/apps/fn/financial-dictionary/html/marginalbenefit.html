<h1>Marginal Benefit</h1>

<p>The additional satisfaction or utility that a person receives from consuming an additional unit of a good or service. A person's marginal benefit is the maximum amount they are willing to pay to consume that additional unit of a good or service. In a normal situation, the marginal benefit will decrease as consumption increases.</p>

<p>For example, assume there is a consumer wishing to purchase an additional burger. If this consumer is willing to pay $10 for that additional burger, then the marginal benefit of consuming that burger is $10. The more burgers the consumer has, the less he or she will want to pay for the next one. This is because the benefit decreases as the quantity consumed increases.</p>

<p>It is important to note that even though the consumer is willing to pay $10 for the burger,this will not necessarily be the burger's price; this is determined by market forces. The difference between the market price and the price the consumer is willing to pay is called consumer surplus.</p>
