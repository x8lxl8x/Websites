<h1>Smoking Gun</h1>

<p>Something that serves as indisputable evidence or proof, especially of a crime.</p>

<p>Here is an example used in everyday language from <i>CNN.com</i> on Feb 6, 2002:</p>

<p>"Maybe there was no proof before, but there is now; a secret memo - personally handed to [U.S. Vice-President Dick] Cheney by Ken Lay [ex-Enron chairman and CEO], which helps explain why the White House is so skittish about Enron and why Cheney and [U.S. President George W.] Bush stubbornly refuse to release the records of those energy task force meetings. The memo was obtained by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and reported exclusively there last week. This is the Enron smoking gun."</p>
