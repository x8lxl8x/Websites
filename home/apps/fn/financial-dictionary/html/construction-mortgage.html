<h1>Construction Mortgage</h1>

<p>A loan borrowed to finance the construction of a home and typically only interest is paid during the construction period. Once the construction is over, the loan amount becomes due and it becomes a normal mortgage. The money is advanced incrementally during construction, as construction progresses.</p>

<p>Financing to build a new home typically comes in the form of a construction-to-permanent loan. This financing option has two parts: a loan to cover the costs of construction, and a mortgage on the finished home. The advantage of such plans is that you have to apply only once and you will have only one loan closing.</p>
