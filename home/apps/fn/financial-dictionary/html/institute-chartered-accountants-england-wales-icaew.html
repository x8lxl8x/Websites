<h1>Institute Of Chartered Accountants In England and Wales (ICAEW</h1>

<p>A group of accountants and finance professionals who have met various industry competency standards in England and Wales. To become a chartered accountant and be designated an Associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ACA), ICAEW members must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete 450 days of relevant work experience (generally three to five years)</li>
<li>Pass stringent exams on financial management, auditing, business strategy, taxation and IT</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar to most professional trade organizations, the ICAEW helps to ensure that potential employers receive assistance from ACA- and FCA-certified accountants by insisting that its members demonstrate a certain level of expertise. In the United States, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants performs a similar service, although one needn't be a member to be designated a certified public accountant (CPA).</p>
