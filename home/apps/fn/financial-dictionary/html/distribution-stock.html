<h1>Distribution Stock</h1>

<p>Distribution stock refers to a large block of a security which is sold into the market gradually in smaller blocks rather than in a single large block. This is typically done to avoid inundating the market with the security and driving down the average selling price of the securities.</p>

<p>It is often necessary for large investment funds to employ traders to watch the market and gradually liquidate significant holdings of securities at the best prices possible. These traders employ a number of techniques to sell distribution stock over time. If a trader is successful, he or she can sell a large position over a period of days, weeks or months without depressing prices or tipping off others to the presence of a large seller in the market.</p>
