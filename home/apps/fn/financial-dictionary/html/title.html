<h1>Title</h1>

<p>The right to the ownership and possession of any item that may be legally recognized as belonging to someone or something. In its most basic sense, title is the recognition of ownership.</p>

<p>There are three components to the concept of title; possession or occupation, the right of possession and apparent ownership.</p>

<p>Under a system of government that recognizes individual property rights, it is possible for an individual to have ownership over a vast amount of tangible or intangible property. Title may be gained by descent, grant or purchase.</p>
