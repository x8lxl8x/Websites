<h1>Press Release</h1>

<p>News that is sent out or released by the company making the news. If it's an earnings press release, the release will discuss the company's financial results for the recently completed quarter and may provide comments from management. Press releases often list valuable contact information that can assist investors in their research, such as the company's web address, and contact and address information.</p>

<p>Remember that press releases are written by the companies, not by a reporter, so they can be full of company bias. Often, as you search online news databases, it may be difficult to distinguish between a press release and a news story written by a journalist. The best way to distinguish the two is by looking closely at the first couple words of the story, which is where the source of the story is usually identified. If the source is identified as "BusinessWire" or "PR Newswire" then it is a press release issued by a company.</p>
