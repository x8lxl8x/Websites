<h1>Common Resource</h1>

<p>A resource, such as water or pasture, that provides users with tangible benefits. A major concern with common resources is overuse, especially when there are poor social-management systems in place to protect the core resource.</p>

<p>Common resources that are not owned by anyone are called open-access resources.</p>

<p>Overuse of common resources often leads to economic problems such as the tragedy of the commons, where user self-interest leads to the destruction of the resource in the long term, to the disadvantage of everyone.</p>
