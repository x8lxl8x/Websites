<h1>Michael S. Dell</h1>

<p>A long-time CEO and chairman of Texas-based computer company, Dell. Mchael Dell is known for the computer company he started in 1984 under the name PCs Limited and now bears his name. The company grew rapidly and competed heavily with IBM, becoming a Fortune 500 company in 1992. Dell has been named to the Forbes lists of the world's richest people and America's highest-paid CEOs.</p>

<p>Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston. His company, Dell, distinguishes itself from other computer manufacturers by allowing customers to order computers with customized specifications directly from the company rather than purchasing premade computers off the shelf in retail stores. It also developed a strategy to limit the company's inventory so it could rapidly and profitably adapt to changing technology. This business model allows Dell to be highly competitive both in price and in customer service. His success allowed him to create the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation with his wife in 1999 to improve the health and education of children living in urban poverty in the United States, South Africa and India.</p>
