<h1>Analyst Meeting</h1>

<p>An annual meeting held by publicly traded corporations where the company executives provide information about how the company is performing and its future prospects. They may also choose to answer questions from analysts and investors. Some companies make their meetings widely available via webcast and/or podcast.</p>

<p>Analyst meetings are just one of many ways corporations provide transparency for their performance figures. Publicly available Securities and Exchange Commission filings required by the federal government, such as the 10-K and 10-Q reports, provide information about a company's major developments, competition, legal proceedings, management, research and development, business segments and financials. Annual reports are another way public companies communicate with shareholders about the company's operations and financial strength.</p>
