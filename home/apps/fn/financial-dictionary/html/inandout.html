<h1>In And Out</h1>

<p>A trading strategy in which shares of a single security are bought and sold over a short period of time. In and out trading strategy can last a single trading session, but may last longer, though less than the period of time associated with a buy and hold trading strategy.</p>

<p>Investors use an in and out trading strategy in an effort to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in the price of a security. It is more likely to be used by day traders, whom are less interested in long-term growth. This strategy tends to be riskier, because it relies on rapid changes in price in order to be profitable.</p>
