<h1>Net Volume</h1>

<p>A term in technical analysis that represents a security's uptick volume minus its downtick volume over a specified period. The net volume of a stock is a consolidated total of the positive and negative movements of the security over the period. A stock that is said to have had a positive net volume over a given period will have seen greater upward movement in its price than downward.</p>

<p>Net volume is an indicator that is also very similar to the idea of money flow. Along with other such indicators, the aforementioned "money flow index" is a useful indicator of net volume. Often traders use such an indicator to judge the momentum or trend of a stock in order to make assumptions about its future price movements.</p>
