<h1>NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite</h1>

<p>A market capitalization-weighted index made up of U.S.-based and international stocks that represent the NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite. The NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite consists of 1,200 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards. The Global Market Select Composite is more exclusive than the Global Market Composite. Every October, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its stocks have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.</p>

<p>This stock index was created in July 2006 when the Nasdaq National Market, created in 1984, split into two tiers, the NASDAQ Global Market and the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The change was nominal, as it did not affect listing standards, but rather was meant to reflect the global scope of the index and the companies listed on it. The select index encompasses about a third of the largest companies listed on the Nasdaq.</p>
