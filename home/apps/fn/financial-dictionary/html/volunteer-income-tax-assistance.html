<h1>Volunteer Income Tax Assistance - VITA</h1>

<p>An IRS program that utilizes volunteers to help provide free tax preparation services to low-income taxpayers. These services are provided at a variety of public locations such as libraries, schools and shopping malls, in certain high-need areas. Additionally, many locations offer free electronic filing services to qualifying taxpayers.</p>

<p>While many low income-tax payers are fully capable of filling out a basic tax form, many lack an understanding of the complex rules for certain tax credits that can aid lower-income tax payers. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program has been instrumental in helping these households receive thousands of dollars in additional refunds. The VITA program is always in need of volunteers and can be contacted at 1-800-829-1040. In addition to the VITA program, the IRS also offers another volunteer-staffed program aimed at helping the elderly (age 60 or older) receive free tax assistance.</p>
