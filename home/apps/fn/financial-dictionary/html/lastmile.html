<h1>Last Mile</h1>

<p>A phrase used in the telecommunications and technology industries to describe the technologies and processes used to connect the end customer to a communications network. The last mile is often stated in terms of the "last-mile problem", because the end link between consumers and connectivity has proved to be disproportionately expensive to solve.</p>

<p>Even compared to the costs associated with rolling out broadband wire and hardware across the expanses of the globe, last-mile connections have been plagued with technological issues and high costs. As a result of this, there are many publicly traded companies engaged primarily in last-mile solutions and services.</p>
