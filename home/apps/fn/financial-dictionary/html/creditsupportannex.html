<h1>Credit Support Annex</h1>

<p>A credit support annex provides credit protection by setting forth the rules governing the mutual posting of collateral. CSAs are used in documenting collateral arrangements between two parties that trade privately negotiated (over-the-counter) derivative securities. The trade is documented under a standard contract called a master agreement, developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).  The two parties must sign the ISDA master agreement and execute a credit support annex before they trade derivatives with each other.
In addition to executing the ISDA master agreement and credit support annex, issuers must implement proper resolutions that give authorization to execute any derivative transactions. Each issuer must also obtain an opinion from its respective legal counsel about whether both parties can enter into swap transactions. Issuers must also ensure that such contracts are binding and enforceable, and obtain final credit approval from a bank. <B>____</B>          </p>
