<h1>Agreement Value Method</h1>

<p>The most common of three official methods established by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association for calculating termination payments on a prematurely ended swap. The agreement value method is based on the terms available for a replacement swap because the counterparty that did not cause the early termination may need to enter into a replacement swap. Replacement swaps are used to calculate termination payments because changes in market conditions since the initial (now-terminated) swap were entered will mean that the terms of that swap are no longer available. The replacement swap will likely have different terms and different interest rates.</p>

<p>The indemnification method and the formula method are alternatives to the agreement value method, but these are not used extensively. A termination event such as an illegality, tax event, tax event upon merger or credit event will cause a swap agreement to be terminated early, as will an event of default such as bankruptcy or failure to pay. If a swap is terminated early, both parties will cease to make the agreed-upon payments, and the counterparty who caused the early termination may be required to pay damages to the other counterparty.</p>
