<h1>Social Style</h1>

<p>A categorization of the way an individual interacts interpersonally with others. The social style model was developed by the TRACOM Group; it is derived from the extent to which an individual falls on a cardinal scale, with two opposing points being controls/emotes (vertically aligned), which measure how assertive the individual is, and tells/asks (horizontally aligned), measuring how responsive or vocal the individual is to events. The grid created by these four characteristics determines the social style:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analytical: Control/Ask</li>
<li>Driving: Control/Tell</li>
<li>Expressive: Emote/Tell</li>
<li>Amiable: Emote/Ask</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying another individual's social style can provide a salesperson with a wealth of information about certain aspects of that individual's life. A car salesman paying attention to a customer's behavior around certain models of sports cars compared to sedans, for example, may lead him to believe that the customer prefers speed over accessibility or size. The customer may become agitated or exhibit excited behavior toward an accompanying friend when near a red convertible, but seem listless near a blue four door.</p>
