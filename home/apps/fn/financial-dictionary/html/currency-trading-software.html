<h1>Currency Trading Software</h1>

<p>Trading software to help the currency trader with forex trading analysis and the execution of trades. Currency trading software provides charts and order-taking methods, which are usually free of charge when a trading account is opened with a forex broker. As with trading software used for trading other securities like stocks or futures, most platforms differ greatly in functionality.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine which software is best because the currency trading software from each retail forex broker is so different. As such, the answer is very personal.</p>

<p>Most forex brokers allow you to open a demo account prior to funding a full account or mini account. Be sure to try out each broker's software during the trial periods to help you better decide which forex trading software best suits your needs.</p>
