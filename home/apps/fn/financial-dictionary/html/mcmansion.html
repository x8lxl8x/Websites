<h1>McMansion</h1>

<p>A slang term that describes a large, opulent house that may be generic in style and represents a good value for a homebuyer in terms of its size. This type of home is built to provide middle and/or upper middle class homeowners with the luxurious housing experience that was previously only available to high-net-worth individuals.</p>

<p>The McMansion term is meant as a play on McDonald's fast food restaurants, as these homes also represent the pervasiveness and excessive consumption that critics often associate with Mcdonald's.</p>

<p>McMansions are often considered a status symbol because their size (often in excess of 3,000 square feet) may exceed the amount of space that shrinking modern families actually need or can afford to maintain.</p>

<p>Many McMansion homeowners live beyond their means as mortgages on these monstrous properties may be 100% mortgages, interest-only mortgages and/or amortized over 40 or more years. The cost of utilities and maintenance in a larger home are also more significant, as is the cost of commuting from the distant suburban settings in which these homes are often located.</p>
