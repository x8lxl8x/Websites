<h1>SEC Form 2-A</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required to disclose the sale and use of proceeds of certain securities.</p>

<p>Each issuer and/or holder of securities sold in reliance upon Regulation A provisions must file seven copies of this report either every two quarters until all the proceeds of the security sale have been applied or 30 calendar days after the final sale, whichever is later. The last filing is labeled the "final report."</p>

<p>It is important to note that the temporary investment of proceeds pending final application does not constitute an application of the proceeds and does not need to be included in this filing.</p>

<p>Form 2-A, which is also known as the Report of Sales and Uses of Proceeds, is a requirement under Rule 257 of Regulation A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.</p>

<p>This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
