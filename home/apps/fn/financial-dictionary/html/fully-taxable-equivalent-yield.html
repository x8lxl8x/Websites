<h1>Fully Taxable Equivalent Yield</h1>

<p>The yield on a municipal bond, when the effect of reduced taxes are taken into account. The fully taxable equivalent yield shows what yield a fully taxable bond would have to give, in order to be equivalent to a tax free municipal bond. The yield is calculated as:</p>

<p>__Yield on a Municipal Bond__
1 - Tax Rate</p>

<p>Investors use the fully taxable equivalent yield to determine whether they will get the same value from a municipal bond, as they would from a taxable bond. Yields on municipal bonds are generally lower than taxable bonds, so the tax implications of having the municipal bond, must outweigh the gap between the two bond types.</p>
