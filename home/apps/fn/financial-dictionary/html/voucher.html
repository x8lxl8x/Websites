<h1>Voucher</h1>

<p>A document recording a liability or allowing for the payment of a liability, or debt. A voucher would be held by the person or company who will receive payment.</p>

<p>For example, if a supplier has documentation that provides evidence that they are owed money for supplies they sold, they would have a voucher. Vouchers are used as evidence that a transaction has taken place and that there is a liability by one of the parties to the transaction.</p>
