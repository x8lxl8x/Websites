<h1>Stock Exchange Daily Official List - SEDOL</h1>

<p>A unique identification code, consisting of seven alphanumeric characters, that is assigned to all securities trading on the London Stock Exchange and on other smaller exchanges in the United Kingdom. SEDOL is used for U.K. domestic and foreign stocks, unit trusts, investment trusts and insurance-linked securities. U.K. stocks that do not trade in the United States can be identified by their SEDOL code.</p>

<p>SEDOL codes are comparable to CUSIP numbers issued by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures for all securities traded in the U.S. A number of circumstances may trigger the issuance of a new SEDOL code, including a change of corporate headquarters to a different country or a corporate merger. Other events only require an issuance of a new code if a new ISIN is issued. These events include a company name change, takeovers and share reclassifications.</p>
