<h1>Capital Stock</h1>

<p>The common and preferred stock a company is authorized to issue, according to their corporate charter. Capital stock represents the size of the equity position of a firm and can be found on the balance sheet (or notes) of a typical financial statement. Firms can both issue more capital stock, or buyback shares that are currently owned by shareholders.</p>

<p>In financial statement analysis, an increasing capital stock account tends to be a sign of economic health, since the company can use the additional proceeds to invest in projects or machinery that will increase corporate profits and/or efficiency. On the other hand, however, firms that continually issue secondary issues of capital stock may be doing so to raise funds, due to poor company performance.</p>
