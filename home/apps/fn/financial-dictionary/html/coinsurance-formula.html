<h1>Coinsurance Formula</h1>

<p>The homeowners insurance formula that determines the amount of reimbursement that a homeowner will receive from a claim. The coinsurance formula becomes effective when a homeowner fails to keep coverage of at least 80% of the home's replacement value. Those in this situation who file a claim will only receive partial reimbursement according to the formula.</p>

<p>The coinsurance formula itself is relatively simple. Begin by dividing the actual amount of coverage on the house by the amount that should have been carried (80% of the replacement value). Then multiply this amount by the amount of the loss, and this will give you the amount of the reimbursement.</p>

<p>If this reimbursement value is greater then the specified limits of a single  insurance company, a secondary coinsurer will supply the remaining funds.</p>
