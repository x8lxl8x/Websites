<h1>Piggy Back Registration</h1>

<p>When an underwriter allows existing company shares to be sold in conjunction with a new public offering. The registration of these securities is said to be "piggybacking" off the IPO (hence the term "piggy back registration"). That said, a piggy back registration is distinct and not the same as "piggybacking."</p>

<p>In order for a piggyback registration to take place, the underwriter must sign off on the idea and the arrangement must be noted in the new issue's prospectus. Under such arrangements, the prospectus will give all the details, including the names of those selling private shares. Piggy back registrations are often done as a means of consolidating all the outstanding shares and allowing joint venturers to participate in the IPO.</p>
