<h1>SEC Form ARS</h1>

<p>This is the annual report to shareholders. It is the principal document used by public companies to report on the current state of its financial condition and is followed by an annual meeting of shareholders.</p>

<p>It has become common practice for most public companies to combine or replace the ARS with  the 10-K, since the financial information in a 10-K is much more comprehensive. A typical ARS will include an overview letter from the chief executive officer (CEO), results of operations, accomplishments and future plans, as well as detailed financial information. These documents, as well as the proxy statement, are essential for fundamental analysis of the ongoing business of a company.</p>
