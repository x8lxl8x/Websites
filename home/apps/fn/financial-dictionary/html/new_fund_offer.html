<h1>New Fund Offer - NFO</h1>

<p>A security offering in which investors may purchase units of a closed-end mutual fund. A new fund offer occurs when a mutual fund is launched, allowing the firm to raise capital for purchasing securities.
A new fund offer is similar to an initial public offering. Both represent attempts to raise capital to further operations. New fund offers are often accompanied by aggressive marketing campaigns, created to entice investors to purchase units in the fund. However, unlike an initial public offering (IPO), the price paid for shares or units is often close to a fair value. This is because the net asset value of the mutual fund typically prevails. Because the future is less certain for companies engaging in an IPO, investors have a better chance to purchase undervalued shares.          </p>
