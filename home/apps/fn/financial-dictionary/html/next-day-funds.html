<h1>Next-Day Funds</h1>

<p>In banking, money that becomes available for use on the day following the day it is deposited. In investing, next-day funds are available the business day following a trade; however, most trades have used same-day funds settlement since 1996, based on the Group of 30's recommendations for improving settlement and clearance risk, efficiency and cost. Same-day funds are available the day the trade is completed or the day the funds are deposited.</p>

<p>Bank deposits must be cleared and settled before they become available. This involves transferring deposits and withdrawals between banks and ensuring that sufficient funds are available to complete the transactions.</p>
