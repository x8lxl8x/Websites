<h1>Interest Rate Call Option</h1>

<p>An interest rate derivative in which the holder has the right to receive an interest payment based on a variable interest rate, and then subsequently pays an interest payment based on a fixed interest rate. If the option is exercised, the investor who sells the interest rate call option will make a net payment to the option holder.</p>

<p>Interest rate call options can be used by an investor wishing to hedge a position in a loan in which interest is paid based on a floating interest rate. By purchasing the interest rate call option, an investor is able to forecast the cash flow that will be paid when the interest payment is due.</p>

<p>Interest rate call options can be used in either a periodic or balloon payment situation.</p>
