<h1>De Jure Corporation</h1>

<p>A business that has fulfilled its requirements for formation according to the regulations for earning a state charter. De jure, meaning "a matter of law," indicates that the company has been fully and legally chartered, and is therefore entitled to do business. A government's granting of a charter assumes that the de jure corporation will remain in compliance; however, while unusual, certain circumstances may lead to the revocation of the charter.</p>

<p>A de jure corporation is one that is lawfully chartered by a state government, and is recognized as a corporation for all purposes. <i>Du jure</i> is opposed to <i>de facto</i>, which connotes "as a matter of practice not founded on law." A de facto corporation generally acts in good faith but has failed to comply with the technical requirements for becoming a de jure corporation.</p>
