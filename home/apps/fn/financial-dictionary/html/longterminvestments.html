<h1>Long-Term Investments</h1>

<p>An account on the asset side of a company's balance sheet that represents the investments that a company intends to hold for more than a year. They may include stocks, bonds, real estate and cash.</p>

<p>The long-term investments account differs largely from the short-term investments account in that the short-term investments will most likely be sold, whereas the long-term investments may never be sold.</p>

<p>A common form of this type of investing occurs when company A invests largely in company B and gains significant influence over company B without having a majority of the voting shares. In this case, the purchase price would be shown as a long-term investment.</p>
