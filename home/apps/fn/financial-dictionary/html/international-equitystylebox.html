<h1>International Equity Style Box</h1>

<p>A visual representation of the principal investment characteristics of foreign stocks and foreign stock funds. The international equity style box is a valuable tool for investors to use to determine the risk-return structures of their international stocks/portfolios and/or how these investments fit into their investing criteria.</p>

<p>Also known as an "international stock style box".</p>

<p>An international equity (stock) style box is comprised of nine squares, or categories, with the investment features of stocks/stock mutual funds presented along its vertical and horizontal axes.</p>

<p>Whereas Morningstar uses percentages of its stock database to determine large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks (company size), internationally, dollar market-capitalizations of less than US$1 billion, US$1 billion to US$5 billion and  more than US$5 billion are used to classify companies as small, medium and large, respectively.</p>
