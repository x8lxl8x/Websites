<h1>Accrued Monthly Benefit</h1>

<p>The earned pension benefit that will be paid to an employee at regular retirement age. The accrued monthly benefit is based on the employee's years of service through the accrual date, and is paid to pension holders each month following retirement.</p>

<p>The accrued monthly benefit is based on the employee's years (or units) of service. Most pension plans can calculate the accrued monthly benefit that an employee will receive based on a number of different cut-off dates (the date the employee will terminate his or her employment and retire). In addition, many employers issue annual benefits statements that specify an employee's accrued monthly pension benefit .</p>
