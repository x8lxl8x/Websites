<h1>Effective Annual Interest Rate</h1>

<p>An investment's annual rate of interest when compounding occurs more often than once a year. Calculated as the following:</p>

<p>Consider a stated annual rate of 10%. Compounded yearly, this rate will turn $1000 into $1100. However, if compounding occurs monthly, $1000 would grow to $1104.70 by the end of the year, rendering an effective annual interest rate of 10.47%. Basically the effective annual rate is the annual rate of interest that accounts for the effect of compounding.</p>
