<h1>Floor Limit</h1>

<p>A purchase amount over which further authorization is needed by the merchant. The floor limit is a predetermined limit set by the merchant and the creditor.</p>

<p>The term originates from when most credit card transactions were done manually rather than electronically. It was a way to ensure that the credit was available to the consumer before the transaction was completed.</p>
