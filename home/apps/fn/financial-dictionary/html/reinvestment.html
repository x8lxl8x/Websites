<p>Using dividends, interest and capital gains earned in an investment or mutual fund to purchase additional shares or units, rather than receiving the distributions in cash.</p>

<p>1. In terms of stocks, it is the reinvestment of dividends to purchase additional shares.</p>

<p>2. In terms of mutual funds, it is the reinvestment of distributions and dividends to purchase additional units of that fund.</p>

<p>3. In terms of tax gain/loss harvesting, it is the realization of losses to offset a capital gains liability.</p>
