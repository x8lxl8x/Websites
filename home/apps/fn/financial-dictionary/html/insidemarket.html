<h1>Inside Market</h1>

<p>The spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price among various market makers in a particular security. Typically, price quotes between market makers feature a lower ask and a higher bid than the quotes made to retail investors in the same security. The inside market ensures liquidity in the market.</p>

<p>The inside market works very much like a series of Vegas sports books. If book A accepts an inordinate amount of money on one team, it bets some of that money on the other team, with book B to balance its accounts. This produces stability in the markets, with fewer severe price fluctuations. In a similar manner, the inside market provides price stability to investors.</p>
