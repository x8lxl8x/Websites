<h1>Customer Service</h1>

<p>The process of ensuring customer satisfaction with a product or service. Often, customer service takes place while performing a transaction for the customer, such as making a sale or returning an item. Customer service can take the form of an in-person interaction, a phone call, self-service systems, or by other means.</p>

<p>Customer service is an extremely important part of maintaining ongoing client relationships that are key to continuing revenue. For this reason, many companies have worked hard to increase their customer satisfaction levels. Often there are many more people working behind the scenes at a company than there are customer service representatives, yet it is primarily the personnel that interact directly with customers that form customers' perceptions of the company as a whole.</p>
