<h1>Sell</h1>

<p>The process of liquidating an asset in exchange for cash. The term "sell" generally refers to the act of exiting a long position in an asset or security. In investment research, "sell" refers to an analyst's recommendation to close out a long position in a stock because of the risk of a price decline.</p>

<p>Since the act of selling an investment crystallizes a profit or a loss, depending on the initial purchase price, it may have tax implications for the investor.</p>

<p>Selling is often disdained by long-term "buy and hold" investors in the belief that market averages usually have positive performance over a prolonged period of time. But selling may actually be a prudent course of action in many situations, especially when it needs to be done to rebalance an investment portfolio.</p>

<p>As far as investment research is concerned, the relative dearth of "Sell" ratings by sell-side analysts at broker-dealers is often cited as an example of their lack of objectivity in research.</p>
