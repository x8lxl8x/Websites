<h1>Check Safekeeping</h1>

<p>A safekeeping service offered by banks and other depository institutions. With check safekeeping, the bank holds all of a customer's cancelled checks (or at least a copy of them) and does not return them to the parties that wrote the checks. Instead, the customer is sent a detailed statement outlining all checks that were paid, plus the amounts and names of the payees.</p>

<p>Check safekeeping is typically done to reduce the expense of labor and postage that comes with mailing printed statements. The actual checks are often transcribed to microfilm or computer and then shredded. This service is also referred to as check retention.</p>
