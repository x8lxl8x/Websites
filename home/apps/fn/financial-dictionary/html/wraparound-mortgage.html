<h1>Wraparound Mortgage</h1>

<p>A type of loan that enables a borrower who is paying off an existing mortgage to obtain more financing from a second lender or seller. The new lender (typically a bank or the seller of the real property) assumes the payment of the existing mortgage and provides the borrower with a new, larger loan, usually at a higher interest rate.</p>

<p>A wraparound mortgage is also known as a wraparound loan, overriding mortgage, or all-inclusive mortgage.</p>

<p>This type of loan is used frequently as a method of refinancing property or financing the purchase of property when an existing mortgage cannot be paid off. The total amount of a wraparound mortgage includes the previous mortgage's unpaid amount plus the additional funds required by the borrower. The borrower makes payments to the new lender on the larger loan, and the new lender makes payments on the original loan.</p>
