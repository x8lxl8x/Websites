<h1>Platykurtic</h1>

<p>A description of the kurtosis in a distribution in which the statistical value is negative. When compared to a normal distribution, a platykurtic data set has a flatter peak around its mean, which causes thin tails within the distribution. The flatness results from the data being less concentrated around its mean, due to large variations within observations.</p>

<p>Referred to as the "volatility of volatility", kurtosis gauges the level of fluctuation within a distribution. High levels of kurtosis represent a low level of data fluctuation, as the observations cluster about the mean. Lower values of kurtosis mean that data has a larger degree of variance.</p>

<p>For example, when looking at past stock returns, analysts will want to determine the likelihood of extreme returns (or losses) in the future. If past stock data results in a platykurtic distribution, analysts will expect more volatility in future returns. This means that there is a higher probability than usual for extreme price movements to occur.</p>
