<h1>Appraiser</h1>

<p>A practitioner who has the knowledge and expertise necessary to estimate the value of an asset, or the likelihood of an event occurring, and the cost of such an occurrence. Ideally, an appraiser acts independently of the buying and selling parties in a transaction in order to arrive at the fair value of an asset without bias.</p>

<p>Appraisers are useful when attempting to attach a value to items such as jewelry, art, gems, family heirlooms and real estate. Because of the lack of liquidity in these assets and the necessity to rely on comparisons to estimate their value, investors tend to hold an appraiser's work in high regard.</p>
