<h1>Brokerage General Agent</h1>

<p>An independent firm or contractor working for an insurance company whose main function is to sell one or more insurance products to select insurance brokers. Brokers then sell the policies to their clients. Brokerage general agents can specialize in one segment of the insurance industry or sell policies across a wide range of insurance companies.</p>

<p>In addition to selling policies, many brokerage general agents provide a wide variety of supportive services for individual brokers, including taking online applications, tracking cases, providing immediate policy quotes and answering underwriting-requirement questions.</p>

<p>There are numerous general industry associations and interest groups serving brokerage general agents, including the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (NAIFA), National Brokerage Agencies and the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. These associations lobby on behalf of members' interests, provide professional training opportunities and promote industry best practices.</p>

<p>Brokerage general agents may also belong to niche trade groups targeting their specific industry focus, such as the Society of Underwriting Brokers (SUB) for life insurance or the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) for health insurance. Many national associations also have regional, state or local chapters.</p>
