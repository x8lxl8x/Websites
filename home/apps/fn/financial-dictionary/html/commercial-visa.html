<h1>Commercial Visa</h1>

<p>A government-issued document that allows noncitizens to enter a foreign country temporarily for business purposes. A country may issue commercial visas for different types of business visits. The United States, for example, issues B-1 visas to professional athletes, investors, business-event attendees, lecturers and speakers, researchers, salespeople, commercial and industrial service engineers, and training-program participants. Individuals wishing to visit a country on a commercial visa must meet certain requirements related to the purpose of their visit, the earning of income and their length of stay.</p>

<p>In addition to visa requirements, travelers should be aware of passport, immunization and other requirements to enter the country they intend to visit. In getting approved for a commercial visa, it may also be necessary or helpful to obtain a letter from the foreign company inviting the individual abroad. Individuals who earn income in a foreign country while traveling on a commercial visa should be aware that they may generate a tax liability to the government of the country they are visiting.</p>
