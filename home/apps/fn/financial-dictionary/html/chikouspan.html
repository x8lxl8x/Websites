<h1>Chikou Span</h1>

<p>A component of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator that is created by plotting recent price movement 26-periods behind the latest closing price. The number of periods used to lag the Chikou span is customizable so that transaction signals are generated more or less frequently.</p>

<p>Also known as the "lagging span".</p>

<p>The trend is deemed to be upward when the Chikou span is located above the closing prices and downward when the indicator is located below them. Many traders watch for the Chikou span to cross below the closing prices as a signal that the price of the asset is getting exhausted and is likely to experience a pullback.</p>
