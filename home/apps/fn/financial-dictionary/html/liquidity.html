<h1>Liquidity</h1>

<p>1. The degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price. Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets.</p>

<p>2. The ability to convert an asset to cash quickly. Also known as "marketability."</p>

<p>There is no specific liquidity formula; however, liquidity is often calculated by using liquidity ratios.
1. It is safer to invest in liquid assets than illiquid ones because it is easier for an investor to get his/her money out of the investment.</p>

<p>2. Examples of assets that are easily converted into cash include blue chip and money market securities.</p>
