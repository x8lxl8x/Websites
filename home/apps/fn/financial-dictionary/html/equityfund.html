<h1>Equity Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that invests principally in stocks. It can be actively or passively (index fund) managed.</p>

<p>Also known as a "stock fund".</p>

<p>Stock mutual funds are principally categorized according to company size, the investment style of the holdings in the portfolio and geography:</p>

<p>Size is determined by a company's market capitalization, while the investment style, reflected in the fund's stock holdings, is also used to categorize equity mutual funds.</p>

<p>Stock funds are also categorized by whether they are domestic (U.S.) or international. These can be broad market, regional or single-country funds.</p>

<p>There are so-called "specialty" stock funds that target business sectors such as healthcare, commodities and real estate.</p>
