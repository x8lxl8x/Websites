<h1>Euro Notes</h1>

<p>Legal tender in the form of a banknote that can be used in exchange for goods and services in the eurozone. Euro notes come in 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euro denominations. The supply of euro notes is controlled by the European Central Bank, which controls the monetary policy in order to maintain price stability in the European Union.</p>

<p>The design of the euro notes was chosen in December 1996 and the theme was inspired by the different architectural styles found throughout Europe. The incorporation of the euro in 1999 has drastically changed the foreign exchange markets and has made the euro one of the most highly liquid and commonly traded currencies in the world.</p>
