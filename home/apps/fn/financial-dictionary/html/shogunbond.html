<h1>Shogun Bond</h1>

<p>A type of foreign-currency denominated bond that is issued in Japan by foreign entities. Organizations such as the World Bank have issued such debt instruments in the past .</p>

<p>Also known as a "geisha bond".</p>

<p>For example, if a Chinese company were to issue a renminbi-denominated bond in Japan, this would be considered a shogun bond.</p>

<p>The shogun bond market has been relatively small. In fact, from 1994 to 2003, there have been no new shogun bond issues.</p>

<p>This bond's name is derived from the word shogun, which refers to the traditional military leader of the Japanese army.</p>
