<h1>Account Reconcilement</h1>

<p>The process of confirming that two separate records of transactions in an account are equal. This can happen internally with a bank or broker, such as between general ledger entries and individual account records. Reconcilement also occurs when a customer of a bank or broker confirms that his or her personal records match what is reported on periodic statements. Ther term can also refer to balancing the books and records of a business with software programs and data entries.</p>

<p>Account reconcilement within financial institutions is a key regulatory and compliance function, and it is a primary focus for outside regulators in their routine audits of the firm. Customers of these firms should also keep an accurate record and report discrepancies promptly.</p>

<p>With the advent of computer systems to record transactions and client positions, reconciling often amounts to fixing small discrepancies of a few dollars, or even pennies, between one source and another. The longer an error goes uncovered, the more difficult it will be to reconcile the two records.</p>
