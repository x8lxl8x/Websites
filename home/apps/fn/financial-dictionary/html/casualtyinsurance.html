<h1>Casualty Insurance</h1>

<p>A broad category of coverage against loss of property, damage or other liabilities. Casualty insurance includes vehicle insurance, liability insurance, theft insurance and elevator insurance.</p>

<p>An important type of casualty insurance for businesses is workers' compensation insurance, which protects a company from liabilities that arise when a worker is injured on the job. For homeowners or car owners, it's important to have casualty insurance as damage can end up being a large expense.</p>
