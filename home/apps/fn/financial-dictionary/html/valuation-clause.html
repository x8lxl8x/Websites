<h1>Valuation Clause</h1>

<p>A provision in certain insurance policies that specifies the amount of money that the policy holder will receive from the insurer if an insured event occurs. The valuation clause stipulates a fixed amount of money that will be paid for insured property in the event of a loss. Several types of valuation clauses can be written, including replacement cost, actual cash value, stated amount and agreed value.</p>

<p>An insurance policy's valuation clause is important because it determines the dollar amount that will be paid in the event of a loss. Because different types of valuation clauses can be used, policyholders should review insurance policy details to determine if adequate coverage is in place.</p>

<p>Valuation clauses can be based on:</p>

<p>Replacement cost: the cost to repair or replace property using the same level of quality as in the original property.</p>

<p>Actual cash value: the cost of repairing or replacing the property, minus any depreciation.</p>

<p>Stated amount: the maximum value of an insured item.</p>

<p>Agreed value: a fair market value to which to insurer and insured agree.</p>
