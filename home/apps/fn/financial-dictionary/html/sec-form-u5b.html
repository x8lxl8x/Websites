<h1>SEC Form U5B</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that was required to be filed by public utility holding companies. The form contained information on the general character of the business done by the registrant and its subsidiaries, which included: interstate transactions, securities outstanding, funded debt, capital stock, contingent liabilities, investments in system securities, investments in other companies, indebtedness of system companies and more. The SEC used this information to monitor the holdings, financings and operations of the registered public utility system.</p>

<p>Form U5B, which is also known as "joint registration statement", was required under Section 5 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which was repealed on August 8, 2005 with the passing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The act regulated the holding companies of electric and natural gas utilities. Because the act was repealed, this form is now obsolete.</p>
