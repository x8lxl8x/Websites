<h1>Business Tax Credits</h1>

<p>A number of federal income tax credits available to businesses that are grouped together and can be claimed using IRS Form 3800. Business tax credits include the following credits: investment, work opportunity, welfare-to-work, alcohol fuels, research and experimentation, low-income housing, enhanced oil recovery and several other credits. These credits can be subtracted from tax.</p>

<p>The credits must be claimed in the order prescribed in Form 3800, so that if the credit limit for the year is exceeded, the tax credits down the list can be carried forward or back. The total general business credit for the year consists of any carryforward of business credits from prior years plus the current year's business credits.</p>
