<h1>Earnings Before Interest & Tax - EBIT</h1>

<p>An indicator of a company's profitability, calculated as revenue minus expenses, excluding tax and interest. EBIT is also referred to as "operating earnings", "operating profit" and "operating income".</p>

<p>In other words, EBIT is all profits before taking into account interest payments and income taxes. An important factor contributing to the widespread use of EBIT is the way in which it nulls the effects of the different capital structures and tax rates used by different companies. By excluding both taxes and interest expenses, the figure hones in on the company's ability to profit and thus makes for easier cross-company comparisons.</p>

<p>EBIT was the precursor to the EBITDA calculation, which takes the process further by removing two non-cash items from the equation (depreciation and amortization).</p>
