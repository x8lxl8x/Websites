<h1>Clean Your Skirts</h1>

<p>A slang phrase used in the equity market to refer to a trader's obligation to make calls and check possible prior obligations related to a security transaction. Prior obligations may include confirming certain transaction details, such as limit prices or conditional events.</p>

<p>Most larger transactions, like those executed by financial institutions, require that traders clean their skirts. Before a trader is able to fill such an order, he or she will usually confirm the order is still executable; this will confirm that the trade is within the price limit and meets all of the client's conditions for an appropriate quantity.</p>
