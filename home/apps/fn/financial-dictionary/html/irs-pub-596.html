<h1>IRS Publication 596</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides information on the earned income credit (EIC) available to individuals earning below a certain income level. In order to qualify to receive the EIC, a taxpayer must have an adjusted gross income (AGI) that falls below a certain threshold, have a valid Social Security number, cannot be married but filing separately, must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien, must not have a high level of investment income and must be employed. If the taxpayer does not have a qualifying child then he or she must be between the ages of 25 and 65.</p>

<p>In order to received the earned income credit, Form 1040 must be filed with the IRS. The taxpayer can then have the IRS determine the amount of EIC, or can use a worksheet to make the calculations. Certain taxpayers are also able to claim an advanced EIC payment if they expect to have a child within the year or earn an income below the qualifying threshold.</p>
