<h1>Generation Gap</h1>

<p>The differences found between members of different generations. More specifically, a generation gap can be used to describe the differences in actions, beliefs, tastes, etc. between members of younger generations when compared to members of older generations. While generation gaps have been prevalent throughout all periods of history, the width (differences) of these gaps have widened in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

<p>Generation gaps play a big role in business, as companies must find a way to balance the needs and views of individuals from differing age groups (not to mention diferents sexes, races and cultures). Also, these businesses must be aware of the changing demographics of their client base, as gender gaps can have drastic effects on not only their business but the overall business cycle as well.</p>
