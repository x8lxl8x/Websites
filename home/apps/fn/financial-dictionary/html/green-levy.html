<h1>Green Levy</h1>

<p>A tax imposed by a government on sources of pollution or carbon emission. A green levy is aimed at discouraging the use of gas guzzlers and inefficient sources of energy, and encouraging the implementation of environmental-friendly alternatives. The term is most commonly used in relation to a tax on fuel-inefficient vehicles.</p>

<p>For example, a green levy introduced in Canada in March 2007 is applicable to new passenger vehicles such as cars and SUVs that have a fuel consumption of 13 liters (approximately three gallons) or more per 100 kilometers (about 62 miles).</p>

<p>Some critics of green levies claim that they amount to stealth taxes that hurt consumers by pushing up vehicle prices, but do little to curb emissions.</p>
