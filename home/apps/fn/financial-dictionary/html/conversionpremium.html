<h1>Conversion Premium</h1>

<p>The amount by which the price of a convertible security exceeds the current market value of the common stock into which it may be converted. A conversion premium is expressed as a dollar amount and represents the difference between the price of the convertible and the greater of the conversion or straight-bond value. Convertibles are securities, such as bonds and preferred shares, that can be exchanged for a specified number of another form (typically common stock) at an agreed-upon price. Convertibles can be converted at the will of the investor or the issuing company can force the conversion.</p>

<p>The conversion premium compares the current market against the higher of the conversion value or straight-bond value. The conversion value is equal to the conversion ratio multiplied by the common stock's market price. For example, if a company issues a convertible bond that can be exchanged in the future for 50 shares of common stock and the common stock is currently valued at $30 per share, the conversion value is $1500 (50 shares X $30). The straight-bond value, on the other hand, is the value of the convertible if it did not have the conversion option.</p>
