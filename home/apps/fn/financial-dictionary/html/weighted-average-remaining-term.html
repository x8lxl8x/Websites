<h1>Weighted Average Remaining Term - WART</h1>

<p>The remaining life of an asset-backed security or a mortgage-backed security. It is measured in months, and is used to denote the remaining maturity of the mortgages or assets that comprise a pool. The weighting factor used in calculating this average is the balance of each mortgage loan in the pool. Also known as weighted average maturity.</p>

<p>The weighted average remaining term is affected by prepayments of the mortgages included in the mortgage-backed security. Therefore, if prepayment is high, the weighted average remaining term would decrease. The prepayment rate measures how quickly home owners pay off their mortgage, a metric which depends on market interest rates.</p>
