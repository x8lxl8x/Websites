<h1>Farmers Home Administration - FmHA</h1>

<p>An agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture created to assist farmers and families living in rural areas by financing and insuring loans for housing and other farming-related needs. The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) provides credit and technical assistance to rural families and communities through four major programs: a housing program, utilities program, business program and community development program. The agency has about 1,900 county and district loans offices nationwide.</p>

<p>The agency was created to provide families with financing tools - such as loans and grants - to help them re-establish self-sufficient farming efforts in the aftermath of the Great Depression. It was originally named the Resettlement Administration and subsequently changed names to Farm Security Administration, Farmers Home Administration and most-recently the Rural Economic and Community Development Service.</p>
