<h1>Capital Base</h1>

<p>1. The capital acquired during an IPO, or the additional offerings of a company, plus any retained earnings.</p>

<p>2. An initial investment plus subsequent investments made by an investor into their portfolio.</p>

<p>1. This is essentially the money contributed by the shareholders who first purchased shares in the company plus retained earnings.</p>

<p>2. Capital base is important because it provides a benchmark when measuring returns. Without it, investors and companies would be unaware of how they are doing relative to their investments.</p>
