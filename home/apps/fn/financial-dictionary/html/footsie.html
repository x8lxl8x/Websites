<h1>Footsie</h1>

<p>A slang term for the Financial Times Actuaries 100 index (FTSE 100). The FTSE 100 index represents roughly 80% of the market capitalization of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) as a whole. While other indices have gained popularity within the LSE, such as the FTSE All-Share Index, the FTSE 100 is still by far the most widely used stock market index globally.</p>

<p>The Footsie consists of 100 blue chip stocks that trade on the London Stock Exchange. The index is maintained by the FTSE Group, which is jointly owned by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange. The FTSE gets its name from the acronym of its two parent companies. The index is weighted by market capitalization, so larger companies make up a larger share of the index.</p>
