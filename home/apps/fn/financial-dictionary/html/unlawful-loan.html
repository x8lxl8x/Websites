<h1>Unlawful Loan</h1>

<p>A generic term used to describe the act of giving money to another party in exchange for future repayment of the principal amount plus interest in a way that breaks a law. Examples include loans with illegally high interest rates, loans in amounts exceeding legal lending limits and loans that disguise their true cost in violation of the Truth in Lending Act.</p>

<p>The Truth in Lending Act applies to most types of credit, whether it be closed-end credit (such as an auto loan or mortgage) or open-ended credit (such as a credit card). The Act regulates what companies can advertise and say about the benefits of their loans or services.</p>
