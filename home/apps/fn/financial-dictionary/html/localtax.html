<h1>Local Tax</h1>

<p>A tax assessed and levied by a local authority such as a county or municipality. A local tax is usually collected in the form of property taxes, and is used to fund a wide range of civic services from garbage collection to sewer maintenance. The amount of local taxes may vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next.</p>

<p>Also known as "municipal tax."</p>

<p>Unlike federal or state taxes, the benefits arising from local taxes are generally apparent at the community level. Municipalities have to face a constant balancing act with regards to levying local taxes, since rising taxes may lead to "taxpayer revolt," while low taxation levels may lead to a cutback of essential services.</p>
