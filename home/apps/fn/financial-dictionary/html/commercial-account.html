<h1>Commercial Account</h1>

<p>Any type of financial account that is owned and used by a business or corporation. Commerical account usually refers to a checking or other type of demand deposit account. Regulation Q of the Federal Reserve prohibits banks from paying interest on this type of account. They instead pay earnings credits that are based upon the average account balance.</p>

<p>Commerical accounts usually have higher monthly service charges and other related fees than retail accounts. Many firms also hold regular interest-bearing savings accounts, which do pay regular interest. Most states also allow sole proprietors to open negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) checking accounts that also pay regular interest.</p>
