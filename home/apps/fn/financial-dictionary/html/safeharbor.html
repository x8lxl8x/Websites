<h1>Safe Harbor</h1>

<p>1. A legal provision to reduce or eliminate liability as long as good faith is demonstrated.</p>

<p>2. A form of shark repellent implemented by a target company acquiring a business that is so poorly regulated that the target itself is less attractive. In effect, this gives the target company a "safe harbor."</p>

<p>3. An accounting method that avoids legal or tax regulations and allows for a simpler method (usually) of determining a tax consequence than those methods described by the precise language of the tax code.</p>

<p>1. In the first case, under SEC rules, safe-harbor provisions protect management from liability for making financial projections and forecasts made in good faith.</p>

<p>2. When trying to scare away sharks, it sometimes helps to stink up the water.</p>

<p>3. Here's an example of an accounting safe harbor: a firm is losing money and therefore cannot claim an investment credit, so it transfers this claim to a company that is profitable and can therefore claim the credit. Then the profitable company leases the asset back to the unprofitable company and passes on the tax savings.</p>
