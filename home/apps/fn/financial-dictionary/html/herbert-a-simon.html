<h1>Herbert A. Simon</h1>

<p>An American economist and social scientist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1978 for his contributions to modern business economics. Herbert Alexander Simon's theory of bounded rationality says that individuals do not make perfectly rational decisions because of the difficulty of obtaining all the information needed to do so.</p>

<p>Simon was born in 1916 in Milwaukee and died in 2001. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and taught computer science and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. His research also focused on artificial intelligence and computer technology. The efficient market hypothesis centers around how much information an investor has to make a decision.</p>
