<h1>Shakeup</h1>

<p>A series of events and processes that a company's management team facilitates in order to change and/or reorganize itself in an attempt to improve its current situation. Shakeups can occur when a business has undergone new ownership or has been performing poorly, and a shift in the company's team or overall strategy is a necessary catalyst for potential success.</p>

<p>For example, Al Dunlap was brought to shake up Scott Paper in an attempt to make the paper company successful. Over the course of an 18-month process of restructuring and cost cutting, Dunlap transformed Scott Paper from a $2.9 billion company into $9.5 billion company.</p>
