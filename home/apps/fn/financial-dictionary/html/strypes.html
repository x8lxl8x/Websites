<h1>Structured Yield Product Exchangeable For Stock - STRYPES</h1>

<p>A type of convertible bond issued by companies that pays a quarterly cash coupon and can also be exchanged for a certain number of shares or receive the cash equivalent at maturity. STRYPES were created and trademarked by Merrill Lynch, and are traded on major exchanges.</p>

<p>STRYPES were created to help sell the stock of a company that pays a low dividend. The yield paid on the STRYPES makes up for the low dividend yield until the investor converts the STRYPES into common shares.</p>

<p>Executives can also use STRYPES to gain cash periodically without significantly diluting a company's share value.</p>

<p>The features of the STRYPES allows high-risk companies to access investment capital that might otherwise be unattainable.</p>
