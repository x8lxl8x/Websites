<h1>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant - FSEOG</h1>

<p>A program that provides funds for undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant is similar to the Federal Pell Grant Program, in that funds awarded do not need to be repaid. Grant amounts are issued between for $100-4,000 per year for eligible students, based on financial need, funding at the student's school and the school's financial aid policies.</p>

<p>The FSEOG funds are dispersed by the student's school, and can be credited to the student's school account or paid directly to the student in the form of a check. The school must release funds at least once per term (semester, trimester or quarter); or at least twice per school year where semester, trimester or quarterly terms are not defined.</p>

<p>Priority is given to students with the lowest expected family contributions (EFCs) at the institution, and those students who are also recipients of the Federal Pell Grant Program.</p>
