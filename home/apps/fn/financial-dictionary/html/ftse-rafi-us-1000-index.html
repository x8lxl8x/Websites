<h1>FTSE RAFI US 1000 Index</h1>

<p>An index of stocks based on the largest 1,000 fundamentally ranked companies. The FTSE RAFI US 1000 Index was launched on November 28, 2005 as part of FTSE Group's non-market cap weighted stocks. The fundamental weighting factors include dividends, book value, sales and cash flow.</p>

<p>The FTSE RAFI US Index tries to reduce the exposure to overvalued stocks. This is especially true for stocks that have recently seen a seemingly unsustainable increase in price. For example the index will have less exposure to stocks that have seen large increases in price compared to their earnings (called P/E ratio). This lower exposure is compared to a market-cap weighted index.</p>
