<h1>IRS Publication 554</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides seniors with information on how to treat retirement income, as well as special deductions and credits that are available. IRS Publication 554 outlines what sources of income are taxable and nontaxable, including retirement plans, Social Security and insurance proceeds. The document also lists common itemized deductions, such as medical care, long-term care, nursing services, medicine and hospital services.</p>

<p>Seniors who are at least 65 years old or are disabled may be entitled to a higher standard deduction than other taxpayers. In addition, the income threshold for a required tax filing is higher for individuals who are at least 65 years old.</p>

<p>The IRS provides extra filing assistance to seniors, and provides volunteers who can help seniors complete their returns. Free tax counseling services are also available.</p>
