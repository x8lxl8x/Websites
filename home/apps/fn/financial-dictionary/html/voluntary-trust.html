<h1>Voluntary Trust</h1>

<p>A type of living trust that is created during the lifetime of the trustor, and is also known as an inter vivos trust. In a voluntary trust, the trustor retains legal title of the gift transferred to the beneficiary, even though the beneficiary has actual title and possession.</p>

<p>A voluntary trust is also defined as an obligation arising out of a personal confidence reposed in, and voluntarily accepted by, one individual for the benefit of another. This is in contrast to an involuntary trust, which is created by law.</p>

<p>No consideration is made in a voluntary trust. In a voluntary trust, the recipient of the trust gives nothing in exchange for the trust but receives it as a pure gift. This distinguishes voluntary trusts from trusts for value, which are trusts made in favor of purchasers and mortgagees.</p>
