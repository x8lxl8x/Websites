<h1>Emblements</h1>

<p>Annual crops cultivated by a tenant which are treated as the tenant's property rather than the landowner's. If a tenant loses possession of the land, he or she is still entitled to finish raising the crops and to harvest them. If the land passes to someone else because of the tenant's death, the crops pass to the tenant's heirs. If the crops are annual but did not require labor by the tenant or if the crops are not annual, they are not considered emblements.</p>

<p>Emblements genrally state that if the crops are annual but did not require labor by the tenant or if the crops are not annual, they are not considered emblements. A late nineteenth century book written by a British lawyer says that, for example, a fruit tree would not be considered an emblement unless it was cultivated by a gardener or nurseryman.</p>
