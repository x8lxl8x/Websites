<h1>After-Hours Market Close</h1>

<p>The last transaction and final price of a security that is traded in the after-hours market. The after-hours market is generally more volatile than the regular market, but it can give investors an idea of what to expect at the start of trading the next day.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "after-hours close".
The percentage of change in the after-hours market is computed by comparing the after-hours close to the market close. If the last price in the market for ABC stock was $5 during regular market trading, this is the opening price in the after-hours market. If the after-hours market close was $10 due to a great earnings release after the market close, the increase expressed as a percentage would be 100%.           </p>
