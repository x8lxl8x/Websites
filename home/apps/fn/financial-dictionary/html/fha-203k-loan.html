<h1>FHA 203(k) Loan</h1>

<p>A type of federally insured mortgage product for individuals who want to rehabilitate or repair a damaged home that will become their primary residence. In addition to the funds to cover the purchase price of the house, the FHA 203(k) loan provides the money needed for repairs and related expenses as part of the loan.</p>

<p>This loan has a low down payment requirement compared to private-sector mortgages and puts rehab projects within reach for individuals who otherwise could not afford them. Supporters of this type of loan say it helps improve communities and broadens home ownership opportunities for individuals; critics say that it's a risky loan product that isn't offered without government underwriting for a good reason.</p>
