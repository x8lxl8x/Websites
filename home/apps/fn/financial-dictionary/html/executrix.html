<h1>Executrix</h1>

<p>A female individual who is responsible for executing the provisions set forth in a will upon the death of the testator. An executrix is nominated by the will's testator. The term is used less frequently than "executor". In a general sense, an executrix or executor is simply someone who is responsible for executing a task.</p>

<p>In terms of estates, regardless of whether the executor of a will is male or female, the responsibilities are the same. An executrix is charged with disbursement of an estate's assets, and is responsible for making sure that the deceased's wishes, as laid out in the will, are carried out. If there is no will, the deceased has died in 'interstate' and an executor or executrix may be appointed.</p>
