<p>1. Restaurants must obtain a liquor license and pay a liquor licensing fee to serve spirits. Hairdressers must pay a licensing fee and obtain a cosmetology license to operate their business. Licensing fees, combined with the fees to get the training necessary to qualify for the license, create barriers to entry in licensed occupations, driving up the costs of services offered by licensed providers.
