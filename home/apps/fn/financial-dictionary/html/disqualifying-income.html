<h1>Disqualifying Income</h1>

<p>A type of income that can disqualify an otherwise eligible taxpayer from receiving the earned income credit. Disqualifying income consists of both taxable and tax-free interest, dividends, net income from rents and royalties, net capital gains and net passive income not received as a result of self-employment.</p>

<p>Taxpayers are only disqualified from receiving the earned income credit if they receive more than a certain amount, which is adjusted annually for inflation.</p>
