<h1>Alternative Tax Net Operating Loss - ATNOL</h1>

<p>The excess of deductions allowed over the income recognized for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes. It is calculated the same way that net operating losses (NOL) are, but with additional rules covering deductions, exclusions and preferences related to AMT.</p>

<p>Section 56 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26) permits taxpayers to substitute the net operating loss with ATNOL when calculating alternative minimum tax. The amount of ATNOL that can be deducted when calculating AMT income cannot exceed 90% of the obligation. If ATNOL exceeds this limit it can still be carried back or forward, but the ATNOLD limit will still apply to the carryback or carryforward year.</p>

<p>When corporations reach a certain size, they can become subject to an alternative minimum tax. Only years in which a corporation is subject to AMT rules will ATNOL rules also apply.</p>

<p>When reporting ATNOL, taxpayers file Form 1045 and Form 6251.</p>
