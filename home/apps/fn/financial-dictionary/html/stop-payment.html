<h1>Stop Payment</h1>

<p>A request made to a financial institution to cancel a check or payment that has not been processed yet. A stop payment order is issued by the account holder, and can only be enacted if the check or payment has not already been processed by the recipient.</p>

<p>Issuing a stop payment order often costs the bank account holder a fee, which is levied by the financial institution. There are several reasons that a stop payment order may be requested. For example, the account holder may have sent a check for the wrong amount, or may have canceled a purchase after having put the check in the mail.</p>
