<h1>SEC Form NSAR-A</h1>

<p>A semi-annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that registered investment management companies make at the end of the first six months of their fiscal year as part of their NSAR form filing requirement. The NSAR, which is specific to registered investment management companies, requires those companies to disclose some financial information (i.e. sales of shares, portfolio turnover rate, etc.) included in the company's annual and/or semi-annual shareholder reports.</p>

<p>Form NSAR-A and all of its related filings are covered under Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") and Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This requires investment companies and trusts to file semi-annual and annual reports with the SEC.</p>
