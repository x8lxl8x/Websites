<h1>3-2-1 Buydown</h1>

<p>A type of mortgage with a series of three initial temporary-start interest rates that increase in a stair-step fashion until a permanent interest rate is reached. Lenders will charge for the temporary interest rate reductions.</p>

<p>A 3-2-1 buydown is sometimes used as a method to help a borrower with excess cash (but a relatively low income) to qualify for a mortgage. Or, a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage might be offered by a builder as incentive to purchase a home.</p>

<p>Paying for a 3-2-1 buydown is similar to paying points on a mortgage in order to lower the interest rate. However, remember, the interest rate reductions on a 3-2-1 buydown are only temporary. A thorough analysis should be conducted to ensure that the buydown is the best economical choice for your current and future situation.</p>
