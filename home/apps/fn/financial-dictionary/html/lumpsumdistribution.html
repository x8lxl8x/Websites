<h1>Lump-Sum Distribution</h1>

<p>A one-time payment for the entire amount due, rather than breaking payments into smaller installments. Some lump-sum distributions receive special tax treatment.</p>

<p>A commission check or a pension plan distribution because of the pensioner's death are two examples of lump-sum distributions.</p>

<p>In general, distributions from qualified plans are treated as lump sum, if the following requirements are met:</p>

<p>1. The total plan balance is distributed over the same tax year.</p>

<p>2. The distribution is made as a result of the employee:
- attaining age 59.5
- being deceased (applicable to beneficiaries)
- separating from service (not applicable to self-employed individuals - but applies to their common-law employees) or
- being disabled (applicable only to self-employed individuals).</p>

<p>3. The distribution occurs after five years of participation (this requirements is waived for beneficiaries).</p>
