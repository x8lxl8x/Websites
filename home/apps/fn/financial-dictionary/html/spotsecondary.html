<h1>Spot Secondary</h1>

<p>The sale of a previously issued security that does not require a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration statement. Certain requirements must be met to avoid registration. A spot secondary offering is typically offered to institutional investors instead of the general public. A secondary distribution differs from a spot secondary in that the former is required to be registered with the SEC.</p>

<p>A spot secondary offering is not registered with the SEC and, as such, can typically be performed more quickly than other types of secondary offerings. Shares that are issued through a spot secondary offering are typically priced at a discount to institutional investors. A managing underwriter, or bookrunner, generally acts as an agent for the firm in purchasing, carrying and distributing the spot secondary offering.</p>
