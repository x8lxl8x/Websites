<h1>Roll Up</h1>

<p>The move from one option position to another that has a higher exercise price. A roll up is a trading action whereby an investor or trader closes an open option position while simultaneously opening a new option position that has a higher strike price or a different expiration, or both. A roll up is typically performed if an investor is bullish on an underlying instrument, such as a stock, and he or she believes the price will rise. This is the opposite of a "roll down" in which an investor simultaneously closes one position and opens another with a lower strike price.</p>

<p>If the new contract involves a higher strike price and a later expiration date, the strategy is called a "roll-up and forward." If the new contract is one with a lower strike price and later expiration date, it is called a "roll-down and forward." A roll up is one of several options strategies for rolling, which is entering a new position while concurrently closing an existing one. Options traders use rolling strategies to respond to changing market conditions and to secure profits, limit losses and manage risk.</p>
