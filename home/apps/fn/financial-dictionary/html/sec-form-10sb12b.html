<h1>SEC Form 10SB12B</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the "Initial Registration of Securities for a Small Business Form", used to register new securities that will be available for public investment. The same general security registration information is required on SEC Form 10SB12B as is on SEC Form 10-12, but in a consolidated format meant to ease the filing burden of smaller companies. This information includes information about the company's management, number of shares to be issued, par value of issued shares and the exchange where the shares will trade.</p>

<p>With the increasing modernization of the SEC's EDGAR Filing System, including a move towards web-based SEC filings, the Form 10SB12B has been discontinued. This does not mean, however, that previously filed Form 10SB12Bs will be removed from the EDGAR system or made unavailable to the public.</p>
