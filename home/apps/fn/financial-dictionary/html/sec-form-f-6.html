<h1>SEC Form F-6</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for the registration of certain securities by foreign issuers. SEC Form F-6 is used to register shares represented by American depositary receipts (ADRs) issued by a depositary against the deposit of the securities of a foreign issuer.</p>

<p>Form F-6 is also known as the Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for depositary shares evidenced by American depositary receipts.</p>

<p>This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
