<h1>REIT ETF</h1>

<p>Exchange-traded funds that invest the majority of assets in equity REIT securities and related derivatives. REIT ETFs are passively managed around an index of publicly traded real estate owners; indexes may vary from provider to provider but two popular benchmarks are the MSCI U.S. REIT Index and the Dow Jones U.S. REIT Index, both of which cover about two-thirds of the aggregate value of the publicly-traded REIT market domestically. REIT ETFs are characterized by their above-average dividend yields.</p>

<p>REIT securities have traits of both equities and fixed income securities; high dividend yields provide consistent income (REITS must pay out the majority of profits to investors each year), but valuations can swing along with the equity market.</p>

<p>Investors should read prospectus materials closely when researching REIT ETFs; many different indexes with a variety of focuses (commercial mortgages, high-risk mortgages etc.) exist.</p>
