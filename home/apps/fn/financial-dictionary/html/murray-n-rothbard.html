<h1>Murray N. Rothbard</h1>

<p>A natural-law libertarian and ardent proponent of Austrian economics, Rothbard was and remains a controversial figure for his belief that the free market should provide even those services that are considered traditional functions of a limited government. He opposed taxation, considering it a form of slavery; espoused self-ownership; and supported the idea of an anarcho-capitalist system that would end the government monopoly on force.</p>

<p>Born in New York in 1926, he earned a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University. In his formative years he was influenced by Ludwig von Mises.</p>
