<h1>Long-Term Capital Gain Or Loss</h1>

<p>A gain or loss from a qualifying investment owned for longer than 12 months and then sold. The amount of an asset sale that counts toward a capital gain or loss is the difference between the sale value and the purchase value. Long-term capital gains are assigned a lower tax rate than short-term capital gains in the United States.</p>

<p>Capital gains and losses can be netted out in any given tax year and up to the first $3,000 of any net gain or loss can be carried over into future years.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that an investor sells three stocks during the calendar year, all of which were held for several years. The first stock is sold for a loss of $3,000, the second is sold for a $2,500 gain and the third is sold for a $4,000 gain. If the investor makes no other sales during the year, he will have a net gain of $3,500 for the year (-$3,000 + $2,500 + $4,000 = $3,500).  The first $3,000 of long-term gains could be carried over into the next year, but the remaining $500 in gains would be taxed that year at the prevailing rate.</p>
