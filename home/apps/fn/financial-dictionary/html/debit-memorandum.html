<h1>Debit Memorandum</h1>

<p>1. A document given to an account holder which states that the account balance has been decreased as a result of factors other than a cash withdrawal or a written check being cashed in. Debit memorandums can arise as a result of bank service charges or bounced check fees. A debit memorandum is typically sent out to bank customers along with their monthly bank statements.
Also known as a "debit memo", for short.</p>

<p>2. The adjustment procedure that occurs following a business's valid complaint against another business. For example, if Company A sends defective merchandise to Company B, a debit memorandum would be issued in order to adjust the accounting statements in terms of debits and credits.</p>

<p>It is usually preferable to avoid debit memorandums from either the individual or business perspective. Individuals typically incur undesirable fees for additional bank service charges or for having a check bounce. On the other hand, there are numerous implicit costs for a business debit memorandum such as possible loss of reputation and human labor to make the necessary adjustments.</p>
