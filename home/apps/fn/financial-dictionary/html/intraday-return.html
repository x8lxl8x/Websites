<h1>Intraday Return</h1>

<p>One of the two components of the total daily return generated by a stock. Intraday return measures the return generated by a stock during regular trading hours, based on its price change from the opening of a trading day to its close. Intraday return and overnight return together constitute the total daily return from a stock, which is based on the price change of a stock from the close of one trading day to the close of the next trading day. Also called daytime return.</p>

<p>Academic research reveals that intraday return is a bigger contributor to total return than overnight return. It also suggests that there is a slight negative correlation between overnight return and intraday return.</p>

<p>Intraday return is of particular importance for day traders, who use daytime gyrations in stocks and markets to make trading profits, and rarely leave positions open overnight.</p>
