<h1>U.S. League Of Savings Institutions</h1>

<p>A now-defunct nationwide organization of savings institutions. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions was created to promote standards of professionalism and congressional lobby influence. It also spearheads public education and deals with federal regulatory authorities.</p>

<p>The earliest version of the U. S. League of Savings Institutions was founded in 1892. It then merged with the National Council of Community Bankers in 1992 to create the Savings and Community Bankers of America. The organization's name was finally changed to America's Community Bankers in January of 1995.</p>
