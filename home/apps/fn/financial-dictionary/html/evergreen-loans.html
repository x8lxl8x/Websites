<h1>Evergreen Loan</h1>

<p>A loan that does not require the principal amount to be paid off within a specified period of time. Evergreen loans are usually in the form of a short-term line of credit that is routinely renewed leaving the principal remaining outstanding for the long term.</p>

<p>Also called a "standing" or "revolving loan".</p>

<p>Credit cards and checking account overdraft lines of credit are widely-used as evergreen or revolving loans. Evergreen loans are a useful type of personal credit because the user does not need to reapply for a new loan every time they need to use it.</p>
