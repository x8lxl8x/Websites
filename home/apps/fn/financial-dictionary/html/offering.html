<h1>Offering</h1>

<p>The issue or sale of a security by a company. It is often used in reference to an initial public offering (IPO) when a company's stock is made available for purchase by the public but it can also be used in the context of a bond issue.</p>

<p>Usually, a company will offer stock or bonds to the public in an attempt to raise capital to invest in expansion or growth. There are instances of companies offering stock or bonds because of liquidity issues (i.e. not enough cash to pay the bills), but investors should be wary of any offering of this type.</p>
