<h1>Quiet Title</h1>

<p>A lawsuit filed to establish ownership of real estate when ownership is in question. Real estate owners want to ensure that they have a clear title, meaning that there are no liens or levies against the title and no disputes over the property's ownership. These possible problems are known as clouds on the title and can be resolved by an action to quiet title.</p>

<p>A clear title is required to close a real estate transaction and is established by title companies, who do a title search to confirm a property's legal owner and check for claims against the property. Title insurance protects interest in a property against legal defects, since title searches are not infallible.</p>
