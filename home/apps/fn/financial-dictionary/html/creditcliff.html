<h1>Credit Cliff</h1>

<p>A slang term referring to the compounding of a company's credit deterioration caused by provisions such as financial covenants, or events that trigger a change in the company's credit rating. These can put pressure on the company's liquidity or its business to a material extent.</p>

<p>For example, if a company is performing poorly it may get a credit rating downgrade, which gives the company a higher cost of capital. This is because a lower rating increases the company's interest payments on its debt, making its situation even worse.</p>

<p>You can think of a highly leveraged company that is in financial trouble as teetering on the edge of a cliff. One false step and it'll be in a freefall.</p>
