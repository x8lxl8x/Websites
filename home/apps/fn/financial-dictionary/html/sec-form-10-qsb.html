<h1>SEC Form 10-QSB</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Quarterly Report for Small Businesses. It is a shortened version of the standard Form 10-Q that public companies must file quarterly. SEC Form 10-QSB includes key information about a company's financial performance, management, and ownership structure. It must be filed within 45 days of the end of the quarter. The SEC has ceased using this form, though existing filings will remain in the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>

<p>Similar to the SEC Form 10-Q, the Form 10-QSB contains valuable information for investors researching potential investments. This is particularly true with the companies that file Form 10-QSB, since the equities issued by these small companies most often trade on the pink sheets or as penny stocks. As such, they do not receive significant coverage by Wall Street analysts.</p>
