<h1>Herd Instinct</h1>

<p>A mentality characterized by a lack of individual decision-making or thoughtfulness, causing people to think and act in the same way as the majority of those around them. In finance, a herd instinct would relate to instances in which individuals gravitate to the same or similar investments, based almost solely on the fact that many others are investing in those stocks. The fear of regret of missing out on a good investment is often a driving force behind herd instinct.</p>

<p>Also known as herding, such investor behavior can often cause large, unsubstantiated rallies or sell-offs, based on seemingly little fundamental evidence to justify either. Herd instinct is the primary cause of bubbles in finance. For example, many look at the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s as a prime example of the ramifications of herd instinct in the development and subsequent pop of that industry's bubble.</p>
