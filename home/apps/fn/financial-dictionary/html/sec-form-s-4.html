<h1>SEC Form S-4</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by a publically traded company that is used to register any material information related to a merger or acquisition. In addition, the form is also submitted by companies undergoing an exchange offer.</p>

<p>Form S-4, is also known as the Registration Statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. It is commonly used by investors who are looking to make quick gains from mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity. The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
