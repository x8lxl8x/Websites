<h1>B/C Loan</h1>

<p>A classification of loans associated with the borrowers that have tainted or limited credit histories. Generally, B/C refers to any loan that is classified as subprime, or a "B" or "C" class loan.</p>

<p>Within the subprime sector borrowers are graded according to their credit history. Different lenders have different grading systems based on different credit requirements. One subprime lender might have a grading system with classifications designated as A to C minus, while another subprime lender might have a grading system with classifications designated as Premium to C which all fall within the subprime sector.</p>

<p>Because of the credit risk associated with subprime lending, B/C loan usually have higher costs and interest rates than prime loans. B/C loans are important financing vehicles for consumers with less than optimal credit histories because they provide an opportunity for such consumers to repair/improve their credit to the point where they can obtain more favorable future financing terms.</p>
