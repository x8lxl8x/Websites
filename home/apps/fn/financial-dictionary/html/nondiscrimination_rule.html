<h1>Nondiscrimination Rule</h1>

<p>A clause found in qualified retirement plans stating that all employees of a company must be eligible for the same benefits, regardless of position within the company. The rule keeps plans from being discriminatory toward highly-compensated employees and company executives.  Nondiscrimination rules are required for a plan to be considered qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</p>

<p>A company may offer non-qualified plans (meaning that contributions are not tax deductible) that are discriminatory or selective in nature, in addition to standard qualified plans.</p>

<p>Nondiscrimination rules must be kept up even when retirement plans such as 401(k)s are amended or transferred to another trustee, according to ERISA guidelines.</p>
