<h1>Mid-Value Stock</h1>

<p>A description of the shares of a company with a medium (or mid-sized) market capitalization that are trading below the stock's intrinsic value.</p>

<p>Value investors typically seek out companies that are trading at a low price, as compared to common valuation metrics such as the P/E ratio and the price-to-book value ratio. When a stock has been identified as a value stock and its market capitalization puts it in the mid-cap range of the market, it is often referred to as a mid-value stock by investors.</p>
