<h1>Fixed-For-Floating Swap</h1>

<p>An advantageous arrangement between two parties (counterparties), in which one party pays a fixed rate, while the other pays a floating rate.</p>

<p>To understand how each party would benefit from this type of arrangement, consider a situation where each party has a comparative advantage to take out a loan at a certain rate and currency. For example, Company A can take out a loan with a one-year term in the U.S. for a fixed rate of 8% and a floating rate of Libor + 1% (which is comparatively cheaper, but they would prefer a fixed rate). On the other hand, Company B can obtain a loan on a one-year term for a fixed rate of 6%, or a floating rate of Libor +3%, consequently, they'd prefer a floating rate.</p>

<p>Through an interest rate swap, each party can swap its interest rate with the other to obtain its preferred interest rate</p>

<p>Note that swap transactions are often facilitated by a swap dealer, who will act as the required counterparty for a fee.</p>
