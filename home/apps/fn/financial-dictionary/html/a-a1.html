<h1>A+/A1</h1>

<p>One of the top ratings that a ratings agency assigns to an issuer or insurer. This rating signifies that the security or carrier has stable financial backing and ample cash reserves. The risk of default for investors or policyholders is very low.</p>

<p>The ratings assigned by the various ratings agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can therefore be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of default. However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.</p>
