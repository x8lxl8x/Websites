<h1>Foreign Tax Deduction</h1>

<p>One of the itemized deductions that may be taken for taxes paid to a foreign government, which typically are classified as a tax withholding. The foreign tax deduction is usually taken in lieu of the foreign tax credit, if the deduction is more advantageous to the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Foreign taxes are deductible from your U.S. income tax return only if the foreign source has an international tax treaty with the United States.</p>

<p>In most cases, the foreign tax credit will provide greater benefits than the deduction. However, the deduction may be more advantageous if the foreign tax rate is high and only a small amount of foreign income relative to domestic income has been received. If the foreign tax deduction is taken, it is reported on Schedule A of the 1040, and the credit can be claimed by filling out Form 1116.</p>

<p>For more information, see IRS Publication 514.</p>
