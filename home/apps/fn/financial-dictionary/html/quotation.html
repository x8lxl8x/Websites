<h1>Quotation</h1>

<p>A very common term which actually refers to two numbers - the highest bid price currently available for a security or commodity and the lowest ask price currently available for the same security/commodity.</p>

<p>A security's or commodity's quotation represents two pieces of information: the price an investor would need to pay to purchase an asset at a particular moment in time (the lowest price "asked" by sellers) and the price an investor would receive for the same asset if they sold it at the same time (the highest "bid" by potential buyers). Taken together, the difference between the two represents the liquidity cost an investor incurs when trading an asset, since they must buy at the bid price and sell as the ask price.</p>
