<h1>Policy Mix</h1>

<p>A government's combined use of fiscal policy and monetary policy to attempt to manage the economy. Monetary and fiscal policies affect each other, and the right policy mix is supposed to achieve desirable macroeconomic outcomes such as price stability, credit availability, economic growth and financial stability.</p>

<p>Monetary policy refers to a national government's handling of the money supply and interest rates. These are often managed by a central bank (in the case of the United States, the Federal Reserve sets the country's monetary policy). Fiscal policy refers to a national government's taxing and spending behavior. An example of a policy mix would be tight monetary policy combined with easy fiscal policy.</p>
