<h1>Appropriated Retained Earnings</h1>

<p>Any unappropriated retained earnings that are specifically not to be used for dividend payments. Appropriated retained earnings can be used for many purposes, such as improving infrastructure, R&D or marketing. They are not passed on directly to shareholders in any form.</p>

<p>Any amount of appropriated retained earnings that are not used for such purposes are then poured back into dividend payments. For example, a company uses $10 million of appropriated retained earnings to build a new factory. But the cost of the factory comes in under budget, so the firm will allocate the remaining funds back into the unappropriated retained earnings.</p>
