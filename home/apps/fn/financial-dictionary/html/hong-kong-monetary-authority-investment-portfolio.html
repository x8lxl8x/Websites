<h1>Hong Kong Monetary Authority Investment Portfolio - HKMA</h1>

<p>A sovereign wealth fund of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Investment Portfolio is only one of two portfolios in the HKMA's Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund also manages a Backing Portfolio supporting the operations of the Hong Kong Currency Board. Since the Backing Portfolio is invested only in highly liquid U.S. government securities, it is generally not considered as part of the sovereign wealth fund. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the Investment Portfolio controls $139.7 billion in assets as of March 2010 and is the 10th largest sovereign wealth fund in the world.</p>

<p>A majority of the Exchange Fund assets are managed internally. All of the Backing Fund is managed internally, and some of the Investment Portfolio is as well. However, the Exchange Fund employs external managers for its equity portfolios and other specialized investments. The investment benchmark for the Exchange Fund consists of 75% bonds and 25% equities.</p>
