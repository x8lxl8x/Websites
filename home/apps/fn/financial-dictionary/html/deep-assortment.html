<h1>Deep Assortment</h1>

<p>A retail merchandising strategy in which the retailer stocks a number of varieties of a particular product line.</p>

<p>Carrying a deep assortment of a particular product can lead a company to becoming a "super specialist". It also limits the space for other products that would allow it to reduce its risk exposure. Some types of businesses are able to offer a deep assortment of a product while at the same time offering a wide variety of products.</p>

<p>Deep assortment is the opposite of shallow assortment.</p>

<p>A deep assortment of a particular product line may involve the company carrying a wide-array of colors and add-ons. A retailer using a deep assortment strategy may be known as a category killer if it focuses on a limited number of products, as it dominates a category of merchandise to such a degree that other businesses are unable to compete.</p>
