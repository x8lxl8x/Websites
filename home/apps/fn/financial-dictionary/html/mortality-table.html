<h1>Mortality Table</h1>

<p>A table that shows the rate of deaths occurring in a defined population during a selected time interval, or survival from birth to any given age. Statistics included in the mortality table show the probability a person's death before their next birthday, based on their age.</p>

<p>Death-rate data help determine prices paid by people who have recently purchased life insurance.</p>

<p>A mortality table is also known as a "life table," an "actuarial table" or a "morbidity table."</p>

<p>Life tables are usually constructed separately for men and for women. Other characteristics can also be included to distinguish different risks, such as smoking status, occupation and socio-economic class. There are even actuarial tables that determine longevity in relation to weight.</p>
