<h1>Technical Skills</h1>

<p>1. The knowledge and abilities needed to accomplish mathematical, engineering, scientific or computer-related duties, as well as other specific tasks. Those with technical skills are often referred to as "technicians" in their chosen field, i.e. audio technicians, electronics technicians, engineering technicians, etc. Microsoft Corporation even offers accreditation as a Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician (MCDST).</p>

<p>2. Technical skills could also refer to the ability of a certain type of stock trader which uses technical analysis to buy and sell stocks. Technical analysis uses charts and trends to look at historical prices. Technical skills in this context would be a slang phrase meaning the person was skilled at technical analysis.</p>

<p>Given the growth of technology, it is hardly surprising that the need for technical skills continues to grow. According to numerous surveys, jobs in network systems, data communications and other hi-tech fields will be among those showing the greatest growth in years to come.</p>
