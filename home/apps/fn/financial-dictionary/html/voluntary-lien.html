<h1>Voluntary Lien</h1>

<p>A claim that one person has over the property of another as security for the payment of a debt. Liens are attached to the property and not to a person. A voluntary lien is contractual or consensual, meaning that the lien is created by an action taken by the debtor, such as a mortgage loan to buy real estate.</p>

<p>A voluntary lien is a type of lien that exists because of an action taken by a debtor. This is the opposite of an involuntary lien that occurs by law, such as a tax or special assessment lien that is imposed by a regulatory authority.</p>
