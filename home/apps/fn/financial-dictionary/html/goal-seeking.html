<h1>Goal Seeking</h1>

<p>The process of finding the correct input when only the output is known. A goal-seeking entrepreneur might ask him or herself: "How much money do I have to earn per hour to gross $100,000 this year?" He or she knows the desired output, $100,000, but will have to work backwards to determine the desired input by figuring out how many hours he or she is able and willing to work in a year and then how much he or she needs to earn per hour, along with any other factors which may affect the final output.</p>

<p>To solve more complex goal-seeking problems, business people commonly rely on computer software. The spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel has a goal-seeking tool built in that allows the user to determine the correct input value for a formula when the desired output is known. This feature can be used, for example, to determine the interest rate a borrower would need to qualify for (the input) if he or she only knows how much he can afford to pay per month (the output).</p>
