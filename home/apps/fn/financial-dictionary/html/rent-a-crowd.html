<h1>Rent-A-Crowd</h1>

<p>A group of people rented to make a business appear busy. Rent-a-crowds are sometimes employed on the grand openings of a new business to give the appearance that something is attracting people to the store, which then potentially attracts real customers, who come to see why the crowd has gathered.</p>

<p>Rent-a-crowds can be a good strategy to help get new customers into the door. This can also make a business look busy and give potential clients the impression that business is good.</p>
