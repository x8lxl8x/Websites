<h1>Conference Of State Bank Supervisors - CSBS</h1>

<p>A national organization founded in 1902 to further advance the ideas and professionalism for state banking departments. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) is also an advocate for the interests of state banking to the respective state legislative and regulatory agencies. The CSBS also provides training and continued educations for examiner professionals.</p>

<p>One of the CSBS's main goals is to advance and protect the United States' dual banking system and to prevent any federal regulatory preemption of state laws that could endanger that dual banking system. Acting as the single voice to congress for state banks, the CSBS also enhances cooperation between state and federal regulators to improve oversight.</p>
