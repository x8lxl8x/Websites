<h1>Cash Card</h1>

<p>A cash card can be any card that you can insert into an ATM or other cash dispenser, or a pre-paid credit card, or a card with a preset cash value from a particular store (Costco or Subway), which is read by a cash card reader and used to pay for products or services at that retailer.</p>

<p>Many financial transactions are now handled through cards, and there are few more potent words in the financial lexicon than "cash." So it's not surprising that financial institutions and retailers like to use "cash card" in their marketing, and that it has come to have various meanings.</p>
