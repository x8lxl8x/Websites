<h1>Capital Gains Yield</h1>

<p>The price appreciation component of a security's (such as a common stock) total return. For stock holdings, the capital gains yield will be the change in price divided by the original (purchase) price.</p>

<p>Calculated as:

</p>

<p>Where:
P<SUB>0</SUB> = Original price of the security
P<SUB>1</SUB> = Current/Selling price of the security
For example, suppose Peter purchased a share of XYZ for $100 and he later sells the share for $110. The capital gains yield for that investment would be 10%.</p>

<p>It is important to analyze both the capital gains yield and the total return yield of an investment holding. Dividends are not to be counted in a capital gains yield assessment, but keep in mind that depending on the stock, dividends could comprise a substantial portion of the total return of the stock compared to capital gains.           </p>
