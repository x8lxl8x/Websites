<h1>Technically Weak Market</h1>

<p>A market in which open interest is increasing and prices are decreasing, or in which open interest is decreasing and prices are increasing. A market in which trading volume does not correspond to price where increasing volume accompanies decreasing prices or decreasing volume accompanies increasing prices.</p>

<p>Also known as technically weak.</p>

<p>Technical analysts are concerned only with the price movements of securities. Unlike fundamental analysts, they do not care about the characteristics of the company that has issued the security. Technical analysts follow trends in a security's supply and demand, as shown on price charts, to choose the most profitable times to buy and sell.</p>
