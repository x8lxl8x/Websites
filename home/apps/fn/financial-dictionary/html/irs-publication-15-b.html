<h1>IRS Publication 15-B - Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service that provides employers with guidance on how to account for fringe benefits when filing tax documents. Fringe benefits are non-cash benefits provided to persons who perform services to a business, and can include perks such as the use of a company car. For employees, the value of any fringe benefit is reported on the W-2. For non-employees, the value of benefits should be reported on Form 1099-MISC or Schedule K-1.</p>

<p>Fringe benefits are considered taxable items by the IRS, but there are exceptions. Some cafeteria plan benefits, typically those involving health care for employees, are still considered to be pre-tax (and thus exempt from income tax withholding) provided that the receiving employee is not highly-compensated or a key person in the company.</p>
