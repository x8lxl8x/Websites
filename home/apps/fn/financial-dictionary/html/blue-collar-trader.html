<h1>Blue Collar Trader </h1>

<p>A trader who has another source of income, and does not trade as a means, but rather as a savings plan, or bonus, etc. This person typically does not trade in large volumes, leaning more towards trying to earn smaller returns. Such a trader is not significantly experienced or knowledgeable in the field, and will therefore tend to stick to less risky investments.</p>

<p>There are many websites, and other information forums to aid blue collar investors in trading. With the right information, blue collar trading can give the trader an extra income source. Blue collar investors work with brokers to gain advice on which investment decisions to make, and will pay a fee for their services, however, due to a highly competitive market, the commissions and fees for such brokers has decreased significantly.</p>
