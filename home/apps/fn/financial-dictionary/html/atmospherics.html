<h1>Atmospherics</h1>

<p>The controllable characteristics of a retail space that entice a customer to enter the store, and which are designed to influence a customer's mood so as to increase the odds of a purchase being made. Atmospherics include the store's layout, noise level, temperature, lighting and decorations. They are designed to set the store apart from its competitors in a positive way. It is part of an overall companies branding and image.</p>

<p>All retails stores have atmospherics, even if they are subtle. For example, a big box office supply store may be known for its well-lit aisles and bright red signs. Another example would be a clothing retailer targeted at teenagers, which uses contrasted lighting and loud music. The drawback to an aggressive use of atmospherics is that they can drive away customers who prefer a more nuanced interaction with their environment.</p>
