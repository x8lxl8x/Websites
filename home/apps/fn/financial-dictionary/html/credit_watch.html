<h1>Credit Watch</h1>

<p>A variety of special programs offered by credit rating agencies and financial institutions to monitor an individual's credit report for any credit related changes. A credit watch allows individuals to act on any red flags before they can have a detrimental effect on credit score/history. Subscribing to such a service can also be used as a form of protection against identity theft.</p>

<p>Most of these paid services will notify the individual within a business day whenever a credit application is made and shows up in your credit report. The intent of this service is to alert individuals of changes to their credit reports. These updates make it easier to determine whether personal information has been compromised.</p>
