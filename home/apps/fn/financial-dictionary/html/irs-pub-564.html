<h1>IRS Publication 564: Mutual Fund Distributions</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provides information on the tax treatment of mutual funds and money market funds. IRS Publication 564 outlines how filers are to report distributions from dividends (both reinvested and ordinary), how to track the cost basis for mutual fund shares and how to identify which shares are sold, and how to report gains and losses when shares are sold or exchanged.</p>

<p>Distributions received from a mutual fund can include an ordinary dividend, capital gain, qualified dividend or a exempt-interest dividend. Rules in IRS Publication 564 do not apply to mutual funds held in a qualified retirement plan, such as 401(k), or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Dividends and mutual fund shares in retirement accounts typically grow tax-free until distributions begin.</p>
