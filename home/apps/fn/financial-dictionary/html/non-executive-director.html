<h1>Non-Executive Director</h1>

<p>A member of a company's board of directors who is not part of the executive team. A non-executive director (NED) typically does not engage in the day-to-day management of the organization, but is involved in policy making and planning exercises. In addition, non-executive directors' responsibilities include the monitoring of the executive directors, and to act in the interest of any stakeholders. Also called external director, independent director and outside director.</p>

<p>Non-executive directors are often included in a firm's lineup for public relations reasons; for instance, the non-executive director's community status and experience could provide good exposure for the firm. Even though they are non-working directors, they can share liability with the executive directors of the firm.</p>
