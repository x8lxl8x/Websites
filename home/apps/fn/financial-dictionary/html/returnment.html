<h1>Returnment</h1>

<p>The act of returning to work after one has retired from one's job. Returnment happens for many reasons: some people do it out of financial necessity, others because they find full-time retirement less fulfilling than they thought and return to work for the satisfaction that work provides.</p>

<p>Returnment is a growing trend, as more people on the cusp of retiring desire more non-traditional retirement/working arrangements. Not all retirees want to live a life of full-time leisure, especially in the early years of their retirement.</p>

<p>In addition, people are living longer and have to support themselves over more years in retirement. With fewer workers having traditional defined-benefit pension plans, many are choosing to go back to work to support themselves financially, but not necessarily in their old jobs.</p>
