<h1>Non-Publicly Offered Mutual Fund</h1>

<p>Mutual funds that are not offered for sale to the general public. Non-publicly offered mutual funds are usually registered via private placement, not as securities, and investors who buy them must meet suitability requirements for income and net worth.</p>

<p>These funds should not be confused with closed-end funds, which have a limited number of shares but are usually offered to the public at large.</p>

<p>The expenses of non-publicly offered mutual funds are not automatically deducted from the returns realized by the investors in the same manner as publicly traded funds. Non-publicly offered mutual fund expenses appear in box 5 of Form 1099-DIV, and investors can deduct those expenses as miscellaneous investment expenses on www.iSchedule A of the 1040.</p>
