<h1>Pop-Up Option</h1>

<p>A joint and survivor pension option, generally limited to married couples, that is triggered if the pension plan member's spouse predeceases the plan member. The pop-up option then boosts the plan member's pension after the spouse's death. The increase in the pension amount is made possible by the fact that the pension plan no longer has to provide a spousal pension once the plan member passes away.</p>

<p>This option has a cost attached to it. All things being equal, a plan member who opts for the pop-up option will receive a smaller pension than a member who does not choose the pop-up option. Since the plan member's spouse would receive this lower pension amount if the plan member passes away first, due consideration should be given to the relative states of health of the plan member and the spouse, in addition to which a cost-benefit analysis on the merits of the pop-up option itself may be necessary.</p>
