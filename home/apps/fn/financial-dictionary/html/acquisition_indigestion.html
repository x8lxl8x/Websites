<h1>Acquisition Indigestion</h1>

<p>A slang term describing an acquisition or merger in which the companies involved have trouble integrating with one another. Acquisition indigestion may also describe a situation in which the purchasing company has difficulty making the most of a takeover.</p>

<p>Indigestion occurs when you eat too much or when you consume food that doesn't agree with your stomach. The same outcome relates to mergers and acquisitions that have gone sour, as companies may get indigestion when acquiring too many targets or purchasing firms that don't integrate well.</p>
