<h1>Level-Premium Insurance</h1>

<p>A type of term life insurance for which the premiums remain the same throughout the duration of the contract. The premium paid on this type of policy will be higher at the beginning of its life but lower towards the end of its life as compared to term policies that have rising premium rates.</p>

<p>This policy is a type of term life insurance, meaning it provides coverage only for a specified duration and it has only a death benefit, no savings component. Therefore, when looking at level-premium insurance, you should carefully consider the length of coverage best suited to your needs. For example, if the primary purpose of the death benefit is to provide income to support very young children and/or fund college expenses, a 20-year level premium might be appropriate. However, if these children are already in their early teens, you may need only a 10-year level premium.</p>

<p>If you enter into this type of insurance policy, it is important to ensure that the premium level is guaranteed. In some cases, a policy's premium level is not guaranteed, and the company can actually raise it to a new premium level which will have to be paid for the remainder of the policy's life.</p>
