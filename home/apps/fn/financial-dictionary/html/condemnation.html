<h1>Condemnation</h1>

<p>The seizure of a property by a public authority for a public purpose. Condemnation often occurs when a taxpayer owns property or real estate in a place that has been designated for public use or construction. Condemnation is exercised by public authorities through the power of eminent domain.</p>

<p>Condemned property must be appraised by the condemning governmental authority. The owner of the property is then offered the appraised value for the property seized. This offer is called a pro tanto award. The owner can decline the award and hire a lawyer if the owner feels the pro tanto award is insufficient.</p>

<p>Condemnations can be used to make way for private projects as well as public ones, if the public authority believes the project will serve the public good.</p>
