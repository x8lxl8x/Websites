<h1>All-In-One Mortgage</h1>

<p>A mortgage loan that combines the features of a checking account, a home equity loan and a mortgage in order allow depositors to reduce the amount of interest paid on their mortgages. Any deposits made into the savings account portion of the all-in-one mortgage are put toward paying the mortgage, but instant liquidity can still be achieved, because cash can be withdrawn in the form of a home equity loan.</p>

<p>The all-in-one mortgage attempts to to mimic the structure of an offset mortgage. While this type of mortgage can help homeowners reduce interest expenses, only individuals who can stick to a budget should use an all-in-one mortgage. For those who lack the discipline to stick to a budget, this arrangement can escalate debt if they draw too much equity out of their homes.</p>
