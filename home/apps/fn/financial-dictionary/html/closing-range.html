<h1>Closing Range</h1>

<p>The band of prices that a security trades at in a specified period, shortly before market close. In the futures market, it refers to the trading range or the minimum and maximum prices that a contract traded at, during the official closing period specified by the exchange.</p>

<p>The closing range for a specific security will generally not be very wide, in the case of an orderly market, but may be quite significant during periods of volatility and turmoil. A pattern of consistently higher closing ranges for a stock, in comparison to its prices over the rest of the day, may indicate that it is being subjected to a form of market manipulation known as "high close."</p>
