<h1>In The Money</h1>

<p>1. For a call option, when the option's strike price is below the market price of the underlying asset.</p>

<p>2. For a put option, when the strike price is above the market price of the underlying asset.</p>

<p>Being in the money does not mean you will profit, it just means the option is worth exercising. This is because the option costs money to buy.</p>

<p>In the money means that your stock option is worth money and you can turn around and sell or exercise it. For example, if John buys a call option on ABC stock with a strike price of $12, and the price of the stock is sitting at $15, the option is considered to be in the money. This is because the option gives John the right to buy the stock for $12 but he could immediately sell the stock for $15, a gain of $3.  If John paid $3.50 for the call, then he wouldn't actually profit from the total trade, but it is still considered in the money.</p>
