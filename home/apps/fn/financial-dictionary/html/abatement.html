<h1>Abatement</h1>

<p>A reduction in the level of taxation faced by an individual or company. Examples of an abatement include a tax decrease, a reduction in penalties or a rebate. If an individual or business overpays its taxes or receives a tax bill that is too high, it can request an abatement from the tax authorities.</p>

<p>A common type of tax abatement is property tax abatement. Individuals who believe that the assessed value of their property is too high, can appeal to their local tax assessor for a tax abatement. Some localities offer property tax abatement to owners who restore, or improve, historic properties located in designated neighborhoods. Some types of properties, such as those containing non-profit businesses, will be granted tax abatements based on the owner's tax-exempt status.</p>
