<h1>Owner Earnings Run Rate</h1>

<p>An extrapolated estimate of an owner's earnings (free cash flow) over a defined period of time (typically a year). This assumes that the firm's financial performance stays consistent throughout the period. Therefore, this estimate can be difficult to assess if the firm is operating in a business that experiences seasonality, because owner earnings from one period may not be applicable across the entire time period.</p>

<p>For example, after three quarters of performance, the company's owner earnings is $9 million. Assuming that performance stays consistent, the company's owner earnings run rate for the fiscal year would be $12 million ($3 million per quarter).</p>

<p>Owner earnings is often an important metric that investor's can use to gauge a firm's financial health. Increased owner earnings tend to act as a signal that a company's subsequent earnings will be good. Therefore, assessing an accurate owner earnings run rate could be very important in predicting the company's longer term performance.</p>
