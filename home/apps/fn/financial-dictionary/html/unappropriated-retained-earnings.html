<h1>Unappropriated Retained Earnings</h1>

<p>Any portion of company earnings that are not classified as appropriated retained earnings. Unappropriated retained earnings cannot be allocated for a specific purpose, such as factory construction or marketing. They are generally passed on to shareholders in the form of dividends.</p>

<p>Unappropriated retained earnings essentially determine the amount of dividend that will be paid to shareholders. The greater the retained earnings, the higher the dividend that can be paid. These earnings are divided among all of the outstanding shares of the company and paid according to a set schedule.</p>
