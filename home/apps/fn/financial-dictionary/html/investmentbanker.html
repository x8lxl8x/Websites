<h1>Investment Banker</h1>

<p>An individual who works in a financial institution that is in the business primarily of raising capital for companies, governments and other entities, or who works in a large bank's division that is involved with these activities. Investment bankers may also provide other services to their clients such as mergers and acquisition advice, or advice on specific transactions, such as a spin-off or reorganization. In smaller organizations that do not have a specific investment banking arm, corporate finance staff may fulfill the duties of investment bankers.</p>

<p>Investment bankers are generally very well-paid individuals, but these positions require specific skills - number-crunching ability, excellent verbal and written communication skills, and the capacity to work very long and grueling hours. Educational requirements usually include an MBA from a top-notch institution and/or the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.</p>

<p>The typical investment banking hierarchy is as follows - analyst, associate, vice president, senior V.P., managing director.</p>

<p>Since investment bankers can come across highly confidential information on companies in the course of their duties, their ability to respect the confidentiality of such information and not use it for their own benefit or for the benefit of their family and friends is of the utmost importance. All investment bankers must abide by their firm's stipulated code of conduct. This code usually contains very restrictive clauses on such matters as the treatment of confidential information, and the investment banker's contact with other employees of the firm, especially in areas such as research and trading.</p>
