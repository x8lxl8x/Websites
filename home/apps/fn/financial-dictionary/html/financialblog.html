<h1>Financial Blog</h1>

<p>An online journal (or web log) that provides news and information related to the finance industry. Financial blogs not only comment on news and information, but some also provide stock analysis based on both fundamental and technical principles. Most, if not all, financial blogs are provided free of charge to the general public. For the most part the style of these blogs is more casual than articles and often reflect the personal opinion of the respective writers.</p>

<p>The use of financial blogs has become a great tool for investors to share their thoughts on the latest news in the finance industry. Financial blogs are not only provided by major financial websites, but also from individual investors.</p>

<p>Since anyone is capable writing a blog without restrictions on the information used, investors should be wary of what they read. Although reputable websites are reliable with their information, blogs provided by individuals may be more subject to manipulation. Unethical investors can use an investing blog to promote stocks in ways to benefit positions they have taken. Investors who use blogs should be aware these sites exist and ensure that a blog they read has an adequate disclosure policy before they act on anything.</p>
