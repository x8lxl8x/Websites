<h1>SEC Form F-80</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that large publicly-traded Canadian foreign private issuers are required to use. These issuers must have had a class of its securities listed on a Canadian exchange for the 12 months preceding the filing, in order to register securities offered in business combinations and exchange offers. The company filing an SEC Form F-80 must have a minimum aggregate market value of the public float of outstanding shares of C$75 million. This form is a wraparound form for the relevant Canadian offering documents required by securities regulation in Canada, and the securities must be offered to U.S. holders on terms no less favorable than those extended to other holders.</p>

<p>Form F-80 is also known as the Registration Statement for Certain Canadian Issuers to be Issued in Exchange Offers or a Business Combination, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
