<h1>Deficit Spending Unit</h1>

<p>A economic term used to describe how an economy or economic unit within an economy has spent more than it has earned over a period of time. To raise the necessary funds to finance a deficit, the economic unit may sell debt (or equity if the entity is a corporation).</p>

<p>During times of economic hardship, governments and municipalities are likely to run deficits to shield the effects of a recession and to spur economic growth. Although it is very unlikely that an economic unit will operate at a surplus all the time, a prolonged deficit will eventually cause long-term hardship for the economy as debt levels become too high.</p>
