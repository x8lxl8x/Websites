<h1>Travel Insurance</h1>

<p>An insurance product designed to cover the costs and reduce the risk associated with unexpected events during domestic or international travel. Travel insurance usually covers the insured in two main categories: costs associated with medical expenses and trip cancellations. Many online companies selling airplane tickets or travel packages allow consumers to purchase travel insurance as an added service. Some travel insurance policies may also cover damage to rented equipment, such as a rental cars, or even the cost of paying a ransom in the case of a kidnapping.</p>

<p>When traveling, costs associated with unexpected events can be much higher, which poses an increased risk to travelers. Travel insurance attempts to reduce these risks. For example, insurance might cover the higher-than-normal medical expenses in a foreign country, or pay for medical evacuation when necessary. Travelers should pay attention to the policy, as insurers may exclude pre-existing medical conditions. Some other events that might be covered are lost or stolen luggage and fraud. The cost of a travel insurance policy may vary by destination; trips to high-conflict zones or areas prone to bad weather could cost more.</p>
