<h1>Rules Of Fair Practice</h1>

<p>A set of rules and regulations developed by the National Association Of Securitie Dealers (NASD) or what is now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The rules are a standard which members of FINRA must follow regarding their duties to customers.</p>

<p>Since FINRA is a self-regulatory organization the rules it enforces must be followed in addition to any commercial securities laws that have been passed. In a broad view, the Rules of Fair Practice cover the fair dealing, duty of loyalty, obligation of disclosure and other duties stockbrokers provide to their customers.</p>
