<h1>Average Annual Current Maturities</h1>

<p>The amount of principal paid on outstanding long-term debt during the upcoming year. Average annual current maturities is a financial figure listed in the notes to the financial statements. If this number is rising annually, it can be assumed that the company is taking on more debt.</p>

<p>Current maturities is the amount of time before a debt needs to be paid back. For example, if a loan was taken eight years ago and needed to be paid back in 10 years, the current maturity is two years.</p>

<p>When a company leverages itself through debt, it can be positive; however, too high a debt level could put a strain on cash resources as the company tries to make its interest payments. A prudent investor will monitor whether a company is taking on more debt and compare the debt levels with assets and revenues to see if the company is leveraging itself efficiently.</p>
