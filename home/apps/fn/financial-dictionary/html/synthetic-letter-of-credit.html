<h1>Synthetic Letter Of Credit</h1>

<p>A letter of credit that has been pre-funded by the bank on the closing date, instead of when the funds are drawn as needed. The funds accessible through a synthetic letter of credit are typically held in a credit-linked deposit account until required.</p>

<p>Since the funds borrowed through a synthetic letter of credit are given immediately, they are a more liquid source of funds to the borrower than a standard letter of credit. The proceeds are therefore considered more secure, as there is no counterparty risk which could result in the funds becoming unavailable.</p>
