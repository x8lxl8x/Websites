<h1>Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI)</h1>

<p>Persons with investable assets of at least US$30 million, excluding personal assets and property such as one's primary residence, collectibles and consumer durables. Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI) comprise the richest people in the world and control a disproportionate amount of global wealth. Ultra high net worth is generally quoted in terms of liquid assets over a certain figure. The exact amount differs by financial institution and region.</p>

<p>The number of richest people has increased in recent years, and they have grown even richer. A 2011 study on UHNWIs by Forbes Insights and Societe Generale found that the biggest growth in numbers of the mega-rich was in the emerging economies, specifically in the BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China. China and Russia had more than 200 billionaires in their ranks - second and third, respectively, behind the U.S. The study also found extremely strong family links among the UNHWIs studied, with a few notable exceptions in Russia.</p>

<p>UHNWIs keep a close eye on their wealth, according to a study by the Institute for Private Investors (IPI). Among families with more than US$200 million in assets, only 20% gave their financial advisors full discretion to make portfolio changes; 44% gave limited discretion and 36% gave no discretion to their advisors and portfolio managers.</p>
