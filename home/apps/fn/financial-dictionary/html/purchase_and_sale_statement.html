<h1>Purchase And Sale Statement - P&S</h1>

<p>A statement communicating adjustments or transactions affecting the margin of a futures trader. The purchase and sale statement is given to the customer by a Futures Commission Merchant whenever a position in a contract is offset or closed out. The P&S statement serves as a summary of the most recent account activity, delivering details of transactions and any changes in margin.</p>

<p>The P&S statement is similar to a receipt for futures transactions. It includes the price, the number of contracts, commissions charged, and the gross or net profit at the conclusion of the deal. A P&S statement is also used to report the new balance of an account, such as when a customer adds or withdraws funds.</p>
