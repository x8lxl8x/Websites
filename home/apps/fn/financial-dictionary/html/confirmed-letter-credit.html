<h1>Confirmed Letter Of Credit</h1>

<p>A second guarantee, in addition to a letter of credit, that commits to payment of the letter of credit. A confirmed letter of credit is typically used when the issuing bank of the letter of credit may have questionable creditworthiness and the seller seeks to get a second guarantee to assure payment.</p>

<p>A letter of credit is a document issued by a bank that allows the holder of the letter to draw the funds as stated on the letter from the issuing bank. In contrast to a confirmed letter of credit, if the seller does not seek the second guarantee, the document would be called a unconfirmed letter of credit.</p>
