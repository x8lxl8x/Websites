<h1>Telecom ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that invests in companies with a significant stake in telephone and internet products, services and technologies. There are many different flavors of telecom ETFs, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the telecommunications industry. International telecom ETFs invest in top telecommunications companies from countries around the world. Telecom services ETFs invest in companies that provide phone and internet service. Other telecom ETFs do not focus on a single aspect of the telecommunications sector but track the sector as a whole.</p>

<p>Also know as "communications industry ETF".</p>

<p>In one respect, telecom ETFs do not offer investors much in the way of diversification and risk mitigation because they are concentrated on a single industry; on the other hand, they do offer diversification and risk mitigation because they allow investors to invest in a basket of telecommunications companies. As a result, telecom ETFs can be less risky than buying a single company's stock.</p>
