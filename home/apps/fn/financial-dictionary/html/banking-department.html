<h1>Banking Department</h1>

<p>A state-specific regulatory body that oversees the operations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction. The primary responsibility of the banking department is to ensure that the financial system is accessible, stable and safe for all consumers.</p>

<p>The state banking department is where many consumers go to file a complaint against a financial institution that is within the banking department's jurisdiction. (Not all banks operating in a state fall within that state's jurisdiction.)</p>

<p>Types of financial institutions that fall under the supervision of the banking department include commercial banks, credit unions, money transmitters and nonbank mortgage lenders.</p>
