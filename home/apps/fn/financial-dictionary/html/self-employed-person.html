<h1>Self-Employed Person</h1>

<p>An independent contractor or sole proprietor who reports income earned from self-employment. Self-employed persons control who they work for, how the work is done and when it is done.</p>

<p>Self-employed persons must pay estimated taxes, usually on a quarterly basis, to cover their FICA and FUTA contributions. They must pay twice as much of the FUTA tax as W-2 employees, who have half of their Social Security and Medicare tax paid by their respective employers.</p>

<p>All self-employed persons report their business income and expenses on Schedule C.</p>
