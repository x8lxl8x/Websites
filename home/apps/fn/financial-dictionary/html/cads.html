<h1>Cash Available For Debt Service - CADS</h1>

<p>A ratio that measures the amount of cash a company has on hand as compared to its debt service obligations. Debt service obligations include all current interest payments due, as well as all current principal repayments due.</p>

<p>Investors generally prefer a company to have a high CADS ratio; the higher the ratio, the more of a cash cushion the company has to fund its upcoming debt service payments. In other words, the higher a company's CADS ratio, the less likely the company will be to default on its debts, making owning its shares much safer for shareholders.</p>
