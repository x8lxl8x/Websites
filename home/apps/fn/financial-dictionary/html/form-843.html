<h1>Form 843: Claim For Refund And Request For Abatement</h1>

<p>A tax form distributed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to claim a refund for certain taxes, interest and penalties. Individual taxpayers can use Form 843 to request, for example, a refund of Social Security or Medicare taxes withheld in excess or in error, or for penalties levied by the IRS in error.</p>

<p>Form 843 should not be used by individuals to claim an income tax refund, or to request a reduction of income, estate or gift tax. Businesses should not use the form to request an abatement of employment taxes, such as FICA.</p>

<p>Taxpayers have to file a separate Form 843 for each tax period and each tax type upon which an abatement or refund is being requested.</p>

<p>The IRS penalizes taxpayers who claim an excessive amount of refund. If the taxpayer is found to have abused the system, he or she will be fined 20% of the amount determined to be excessive. The penalty may be waived if the taxpayer had a reasonable basis to make the claim.</p>
