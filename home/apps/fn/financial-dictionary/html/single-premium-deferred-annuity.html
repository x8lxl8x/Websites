<h1>Single-Premium Deferred Annuity - SPDA</h1>

<p>A type of annuity contract that is established with a single lump-sum payment by the owner. The annuity then grows on a tax-deferred basis until annuitization. Single-Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDA) can be either fixed or variable, and distributions are only taxed when you take them. There is no investment limits regarding how much you wish to invest in a SPDA.</p>

<p>Single Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDA) differ from immediate contracts in that they grow tax-deferred for a period of time before annuitization. They also differ from flexible-premium contracts where the investor makes multiple payments into the contract over a period of time while the assets grow. SPDA is appropriate for investors who need steady income and have a lump-sum balance to invest.</p>
