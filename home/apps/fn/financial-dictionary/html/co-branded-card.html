<h1>Co-branded Card</h1>

<p>Any credit card that is offered by a credit card company that is jointly sponsored by both a bank and a retail merchant. This type of card can generally be issued more cheaply than private label retail cards. This type of card is designed to give the issuing bank access to the retailer's customer base.</p>

<p>Co-branded cards often come with a variety of incentives, such as discounts or rebates of various types. Cards of this genre are affiliated with specific merchants, and not general professional groups or other types of associations. However, co-branded cards can also be used with other merchants.</p>
