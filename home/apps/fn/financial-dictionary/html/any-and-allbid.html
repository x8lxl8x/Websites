<h1>Any-and-All Bid</h1>

<p>A bid made to purchase all stock being offered at a specific price. Add-and all bid is the actual order given for the purchase of shares at the price.</p>

<p>Any and all bids are commonly used by companies attempting takeovers. The acquiring company will place an order to buy any stock being offered for a set duration or up to a set quantity.</p>

<p>For example, if company A wanted to acquire 50% of company B's stock, they may place an any and all bid for $10. This would result in company A buying any shares being offered on public exchanges for $10 or less.</p>
