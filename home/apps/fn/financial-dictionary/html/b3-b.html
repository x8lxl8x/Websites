<h1>B3/B-</h1>

<p>One of the lower ratings that a ratings agency assigns to a security or insurance carrier. This rating signifies a higher risk of default and greater risk to investors or policyholders. Entities that receive this rating are often experiencing financial instability or hold inadequate cash reserves.</p>

<p>The ratings assigned by the various ratings agencies are based primarily upon the insurer's or issuer's creditworthiness. This rating can therefore be interpreted as a direct measure of the probability of default. However, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.</p>
