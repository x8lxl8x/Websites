<h1>Time-Weighted Rate of Return</h1>

<p>A measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. Because this method eliminates the distorting effects created by inflows of new money, it is used to compare the returns of investment managers.</p>

<p>This is also called the "geometric mean return," as the reinvestment is captured by using the geometric total and mean, rather than the arithmetic total and mean.</p>

<p>It is assumed that all cash distributions are reinvested in the portfolio and the exact same periods are used for comparisons. When calculating time-weighted rate of return, the effect of varying cash inflows is eliminated by assuming a single investment at the beginning of a period and measuring the growth or loss of market value to the end of that period.</p>
