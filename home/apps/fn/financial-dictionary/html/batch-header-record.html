<h1>Batch Header Record</h1>

<p>A standard record of information regarding the transfer of a group of data (a batch), usually within the banking field. The batch header record contains information that is crucial for the successful processing of the batch. It identifies the origin of the transaction and summarizes the debits and/or credits involved. When combined with the entry detail records, the batch header record fully describes the transaction.</p>

<p>In banking, the batch header record is used in the automated clearing house (ACH), which is a batch-oriented electronic funds transfer system. To begin, the transaction is given a file header record to identify the origin and characteristics of the file. This is followed by a number of batches, each with its own batch header record.</p>

<p>Although the batch header record is predominantly used in banking transactions, it is also used in other important transfers, such as between businesses, departments and hospitals.</p>
