<h1>SEC Form 24F-2NT</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is required when an investment company, such as a mutual fund, sells more shares than initially stated in its registration filing. Information included on SEC Form 24F-2NT includes the amount of additional shares to be registered and the retroactive registration date for the additional shares.</p>

<p>In the event that a closed-end mutual fund or unit investment sell more shares than originally stated, SEC Form 24F-2NT allows the company to remain compliant by notifying the SEC of the additional shares. This form replaced SEC From 24F-2EL which had previously served the same purpose.</p>
