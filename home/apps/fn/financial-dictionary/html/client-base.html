<h1>Client Base</h1>

<p>A company's primary source of business. A client base consists of the current customers paying for the products, or services, as well as potential customers which have a high likelihood of becoming customers. Businesses rely on this group for most of the business sales, and focus on them for developing new products, or advertising. A client base is usually defined using demographics such as age, location or gender, and can change over time.</p>

<p>Developing, maintaining and expanding its client base is a major concern for any business, since without clients, the business cannot earn revenue. Strategies companies use to increase this base include networking, word-of-mouth marketing and referrals, developing a specialty or area of expertise, staying in touch with existing clients, showing appreciation for clients and consistently meeting or exceeding expectations.</p>

<p>Businesses that primarily provide professional services (like financial planning) tend to use the term "client base", while businesses that primarily provide products tend to use the term "customers". For example a financial planner's client base would consist of all the people who have hired her to manage their money. A CPA's client base would include of all the people and businesses whose tax returns he prepares.</p>
