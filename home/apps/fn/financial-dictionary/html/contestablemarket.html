<h1>Contestable Market Theory</h1>

<p>An economic concept that refers to a market in which there are only a few companies that, because of the threat of new entrants, behave in a competitive manner.</p>

<p>The contestable market theory assumes that even in a monopoly or oligopoly, the existing companies will behave competitively when there is a lack of barriers, such as government regulation and high entry costs, to prevent new companies from entering the market.</p>

<p>Considerable criticism surrounds this theory because there are often large entry and exit costs associated with entering a market.</p>
