<h1>Social Security Administration - SSA</h1>

<p>A U.S. government agency created in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the SSA administers the social insurance programs in the United States. The agency covers a wide range of social security services, such as disability, retirement and survivors' benefits. Previously operating under the Department of Health and Human Services, the SSA has operated as a wholly independent agency since 1994.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of U.S. federal government agencies, the SSA is not headquartered in Washington D.C. Instead, the agency is based in the city of Woodland, which is a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland. The SSA has seen numerous name changes and operational revisions in its lifetime as different administrations shaped the agency into their desired forms. The SSA provides a wide range of services, including (at the time of writing) determining citizen eligibility and premium payments for the Medicare program.</p>
