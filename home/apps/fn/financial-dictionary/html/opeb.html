<h1>Other Post-Employment Benefits - OPEB</h1>

<p>Post-employment benefits that an employee will begin to receive at the start of retirement. This does not include pension benefits paid to the retired employee. Other post-employment benefits that a retiree can be compensated for are life insurance premiums, healthcare premiums and deferred-compensation arrangements.</p>

<p>Life insurance and healthcare premiums that a retired employee 'earns' after retirement will most likely continue to be a taxable benefit. This will increase the retiree's total income tax payable for any given year.</p>

<p>A deferred-compensation arrangement is a salary agreement where the employee, based on his/her work history or performance, is paid a salary for some predetermined time after retiring. The tax consequences for such an arrangement are often unattractive to the company, as payments are not usually tax deductible.</p>
