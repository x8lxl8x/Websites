<h1>Regulation O</h1>

<p>One of the regulations set forth by the Federal Reserve. Regulation O places limits and stipulations on the credit extension that a member bank can offer to its executive officers, principal shareholders and directors. This regulation also implements certain reporting requirements as set forth in previous financial legislation.</p>

<p>Regulation O has put into effect the requirements for reporting as laid out in two previous financial laws: the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 as well as the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. Any bank with federal insurance must include a full report of all credit extended to its officers and key shareholders in every quarterly report.</p>
