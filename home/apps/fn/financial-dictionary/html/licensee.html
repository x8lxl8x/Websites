<h1>Licensee</h1>

<p>An individual who is allowed to enter a piece of property by permission of the owner. For the purpose of this definition, there cannot be any kind of reciprocal profit motive between the licensee and the property owner. Someone who is allowed to hunt on a piece of property would be classified as a licensee.</p>

<p>The simplest definition of licensee is simply someone who has been issued a license. This can be any type of license, including one to sell insurance or securities. But the legal definition is listed above, and property owners are required to inform licensees of any possible dangers on the property.</p>
