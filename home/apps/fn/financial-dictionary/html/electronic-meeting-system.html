<h1>Electronic Meeting System - EMS</h1>

<p>A computer-based system that stimulates problem-solving and decision-making within a group. Standard features of electronic meeting systems include electronic brainstorming (generally in anonymous format), parallel processing, discussion tools and voting. The unique features of EMS systems overcome the limitations of traditional face-to-face meetings such as lack of participation, criticism and domination of the proceedings by a few members.</p>

<p>EMS systems are distinct from web conferencing systems, although both have some features in common and complement each other in the modern workplace. EMS systems confer many advantages on users, such as reduction in travel costs, increased participation through anonymity and better participant availability. These advantages more than offset the major drawback of such systems, which is a lack of personal contact.</p>
