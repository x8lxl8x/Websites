<h1>Economist</h1>

<p>An expert who studies the relationship between a society's resources and its production or output. The societies studied may range from the smallest of local communities to an entire nation or even the global economy.</p>

<p>The expert opinions and research findings of an economist are used to help shape a wide variety of policies, including interest rates, tax laws, employment programs, international trade agreements and corporate strategies.</p>

<p>There is a good chance that someone interested in a career as an economist will work for the government. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 50% of all economists work for either a federal or state agency. The remainder are employed as professors, by corporations or as part of economic think tanks.</p>

<p>A career as an economist has two main requirements. First, economists generally hold advanced degrees, such as a PhD or a master's degree. Second, economists typically develop an area of specialization where they focus their research efforts.</p>
