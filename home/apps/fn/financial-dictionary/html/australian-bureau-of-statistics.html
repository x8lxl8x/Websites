<h1>Australian Bureau of Statistics - ABS</h1>

<p>Australia's national statistical office. The mission statement of the ABS is to assist and facilitate informed decision making, research, and discussion within governments and the community by providing a high quality and objective national statistical service.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS), the predecessor to the ABS, was established in 1905. It was replaced in 1974 by the ABS. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Act of 1975 established the ABS as a statutory authority headed by the Australian Statistician and responsible to the Treasurer.</p>
