<h1>Distribution In Kind</h1>

<p>A payment made in the form of securities or other property, rather than in cash. A distribution in kind may be made in several different situations, including a stock dividend, inheritance or taking securities out of a tax-deferred account. It can also refer to the transferal of an asset to a beneficiary over the option of liquidating the position and transferring the cash.</p>

<p>Also referred to as a "distribution in specie."</p>

<p>The most common form of a distribution in kind occurs when a company pays a dividend in stock, rather than in cash. A distribution in kind may also be employed for tax reasons. In certain situations, receiving appreciated property directly can result in a lower tax bill versus selling the property and receiving the value of the property in cash.</p>
