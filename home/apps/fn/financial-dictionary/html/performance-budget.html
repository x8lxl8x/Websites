<h1>Performance Budget</h1>

<p>A budget that reflects the input of resources and the output of services for each unit of an organization. This type of budget is commonly used by the government to show the link between the funds provided to the public and the outcome of these services.</p>

<p>Decisions made on these types of budgets focus more on outputs or outcomes of services than on decisions made based on inputs. In other words, allocation of funds and resources are based on their potential results. Performance budgets place priority on employees' commitment to produce positive results, particularly in the public sector.</p>
