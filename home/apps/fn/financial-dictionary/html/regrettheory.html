<h1>Regret Theory</h1>

<p>A theory that says people anticipate regret if they make a wrong choice, and take this anticipation into consideration when making decisions. Fear of regret can play a large role in dissuading or motivating someone to do something.</p>

<p>In investing, the fear of regret can make investors either risk averse or motivate them to take greater risks. For example, suppose that an investor buys stock in a small growth company based only on a friend's recommendation. After six months, the stock falls to 50% of the purchase price, so the investor sells the stock at a loss. To avoid this regret in the future, the investor will ask questions and research any stocks that his friend recommends.</p>

<p>Conversely, say the investor didn't take the friend's recommendation to buy the stock, but the price increased by 50% rather than decreasing. Thus, to avoid the regret of missing out, the investor will be less risk averse and buy any stocks that his friend recommends in the future.</p>
