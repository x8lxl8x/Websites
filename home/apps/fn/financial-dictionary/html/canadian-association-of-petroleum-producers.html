<h1>Canadian Association Of Petroleum Producers - CAPP</h1>

<p>A trade organization whose members operate petroleum and natural gas interests in Canada. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers lobbies the Canadian government on issues relating to the environment, regulations and production and exploitation of oil and gas fields. The members of CAPP control 90% of the petroleum production in Canada.</p>

<p>Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers was formed from the combination of several different organizations, including the Canadian Petroleum Association (CPA), The Alberta Oil Operators' Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada (IPAC). While it traces its origin to 1927, its present form was created in 1992.</p>
