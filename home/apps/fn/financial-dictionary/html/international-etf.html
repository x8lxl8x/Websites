<h1>International ETF</h1>

<p>Any exchange-traded fund that invests in foreign-based securities. The focus may be global, regional (such as Latin America, Asia-Pacific, etc.) or on a specific country.</p>

<p>International ETFs are invested passively around an underlying index, but the index may vary substantially from one fund manager to the next. Some funds, especially those with a wide global footprint or those that invest in countries with advanced economies, can provide strong diversification by investing in hundreds of companies.
ETFs that invest in a single foreign country may carry higher risks than international ETFs that spread their investments among many countries. If a single country undergoes a major recession or other financial hardship, an ETF that only invests in securities based there could have a major performance shortfall.</p>

<p>International ETFs are becoming a widespread investment vehicle for U.S. investors, as many global economies are growing at a faster rate and, thanks to rapid advances in globalization and financial regulation, their financial markets are opening to outside investment.</p>

<p>In general, expense ratios for international ETFs tend to be higher than the averages because of the higher costs to invest abroad.</p>
