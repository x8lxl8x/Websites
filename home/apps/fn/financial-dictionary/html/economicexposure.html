<h1>Economic Exposure</h1>

<p>An exposure to fluctuating exchange rates, which affects a company's earnings, cash flow and foreign investments. The extent to which a company is affected by economic exposure depends on the specific characteristics of the company and its industry.</p>

<p>Most large companies attempt to minimize the risk of fluctuating exchange rates by hedging with positions in the forex market. Companies that do a lot of business in many countries, such as import/export companies, are at particular risk for economic exposure.</p>
