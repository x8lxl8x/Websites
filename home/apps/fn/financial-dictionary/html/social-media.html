<h1>Social Media</h1>

<p>Internet-based software and interfaces that allow individuals to interact with one another, exchanging details about their lives such as biographical data, professional information, personal photos and up-to-the-minute thoughts.</p>

<p>Social media originated as strictly a personal tool that people used to interact with friends and family but were later adopted by businesses that wanted to take advantage of a popular new communication method to reach out to customers, for example, by informing them of sales and offering them special coupons.</p>

<p>Through social media, anyone with internet access can interact with millions of people online. It is not necessary to be a journalist, a politician, a CEO or to hold any other position that was traditionally necessary to be able to disseminate one's thoughts or ideas to a wide audience.</p>
