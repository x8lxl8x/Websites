<h1>Settlement Statement</h1>

<p>A statement that summarizes all the fees and charges that both the homebuyer and seller face during the settlement process of a housing transaction. This form, which is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is also known as the HUD-1.</p>

<p>Other things that are listed on a summary statement include the property's purchase price, the size of the homebuyer's mortgage loan and any points or similar deductions that the homebuyer has incurred.</p>

<p>Typically, a homebuyer has the right to examine the settlement statement one business day before settlement.</p>
