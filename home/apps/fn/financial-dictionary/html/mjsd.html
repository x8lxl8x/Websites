<h1>MJSD</h1>

<p>An acronym that represents the months March, June, September and December. MJSD is an important acronym in finance since each letter represents the final month in the four quarters - the three-month periods on a financial calendar that act as a basis for the reporting of earnings, the paying of dividends, the paying of interest and the expiration of certain financial contracts.</p>

<p>All public companies in the United States must file quarterly reports (known as 10-Qs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Each 10-Q contains the public company's unaudited financial statements and company operations information for the previous three months (quarter). 10-Qs are required for the first three quarters of the year and an annual report, known as a 10-K, which includes all of the quarters, must be filed after the end of the year.</p>
