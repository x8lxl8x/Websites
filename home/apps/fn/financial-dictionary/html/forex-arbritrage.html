<h1>Forex Arbitrage</h1>

<p>A trading strategy that is used by forex traders who attempt to make a profit on the inefficiency in the pricing of currency pairs. The strategy involves reacting quickly to opportunities, and is usually accomplished through the use of computers.</p>

<p>As with other arbitrage strategies, the act of exploiting pricing inefficiencies will actually correct the problem in the market. For this reason, these opportunities are often only around for a very short time. Arbitrage currency trading requires the availability of real-time pricing quotes and the ability react quickly as opportunities present themselves.</p>

<p>Forex arbitrage calculators are available to help find these opportunities more quickly, but as with all software, programs and platforms used in retail forex trading, it is important to try them out in a demo account if possible. Trying out multiple products before deciding on one is the only way to determine what is best for the forex trader.</p>
