<h1>Trading Desk</h1>

<p>A desk where transactions for buying and selling securities occur. Trading desks can be found in most organizations (banks, finance companies, etc.) involved in trading investment instruments such as equities, fixed-income securities, futures, commodities and foreign exchange. A trading desk provides traders with access to instantaneous trade executions. Also known as "dealing desk".</p>

<p>Trading desks can be either large or small depending on the organization and are occupied by licensed traders, usually specializing in trading one particular type of investment product (e.g. forex traders, commodities traders, stock traders, etc.). The instantaneous trade executions can be particularly important for day traders looking for arbitrage opportunities that usually last only minutes or even seconds.</p>
