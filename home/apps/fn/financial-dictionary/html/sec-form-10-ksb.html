<h1>SEC Form 10-KSB</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Annual Report for Small Businesses. It is an abbreviated version of the standard Form 10-K that most large public companies must file annually. SEC Form 10-KSB includes key information about a company's financial strength, leadership, and ownership structure. It must be filed within 90 days of the end of the year. This form will no longer be used after March 16, 2009, although existing filings will remain in the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>

<p>Similar to the SEC Form 10-K, the Form 10-KSB contains crucial information for investors researching potential investments. This is especially true with the companies that file the Form 10-KSB since the stocks of these small companies most often trade as "penny stocks." Consequently, they do not receive significant coverage by third-party analysts.</p>
