<h1>Convertible ARM</h1>

<p>An Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) that gives the borrower the option to convert to a fixed-rate mortgage. Convertible ARMs are marketed as a way to avoid rising interest rates and usually include specific conditions. The financial institution often charges a fee to switch the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>

<p>Convertible ARMS can be used to lock in to an interest rate if the borrower feels the rates will increase. Restrictions include the ability to lock in only within a certain period, such as the first five years. The mortgages can also have beneficial terms; for example, the locked-in interest rate is often the lowest rate offered within the seven days prior to locking in (the interest rate is usually a little higher than the current market rate).</p>
