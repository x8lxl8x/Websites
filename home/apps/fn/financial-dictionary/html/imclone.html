<h1>ImClone - IMCL</h1>

<p>A publicly-traded biotechnology company marketing products in the field of oncology. The company made international headlines in 2002 after ImClone's founder and CEO Sam Waksal was indicted for attempting an insider trade of the company's stock. Shortly after Waksal's indictment, "domestic diva" Martha Stewart was also indicted for insider trading of the same stock. Stewart received information from Waksal and her own broker that Waksal had been trying to dump $5 million worth of his shares in the company on insider information, and she sold her shares on the knowledge that Waksal had tried to sell his.</p>

<p>Both Sam Waksal and Martha Stewart were convicted of insider trading and other crimes and were sentenced to spend time in federal prisons.</p>
