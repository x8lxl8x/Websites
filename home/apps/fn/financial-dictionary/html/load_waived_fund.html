<h1>Load-Waived Funds</h1>

<p>A share class of a mutual fund that does not require its investors to pay fees (such as front-end loads). Owning shares in a load-waived fund is a benefit to investors because it allows them to retain all of their investment's return instead of losing a portion of it to fees. In most cases, mutual fund companies will limit the number of load-waived funds available to only certain investors.
For example, the purchase of load-waived funds is sometimes restricted to those involved in defined contribution retirement plans and also for investors that invest a substantial amount in the mutual fund company's funds (such as institutional investors).</p>

<p>These special mutual fund shares commonly have an "LW" at the end of the fund's name and ticker in order to differentiate them.          </p>
