<h1>José Dutra</h1>

<p>A former president and CEO of Brazilian oil company, Petrobrás. Dutra earned his degree in geology from the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro in 1979. The following year, he began his 15-year career as a geologist by working at Geologia Sondangens and then at Petrobrás Mineradora. He then joined Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and later spent eight years as a senator in the Brazilian Government before becoming head of Petrobrás.</p>

<p>Brazil's President, Luiz Inacio da Silva, appointed Dutra president and CEO of Petrobrás in 2003 because the government partially owned a share of the company and had the right to appoint its management. Dutra left his position in 2005, but after a failed senatorial bid in 2006, he returned as president of Petrobrás from 2007-2009. In 2010 he was elected to a two-year term as president of Brazil's Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers Party).</p>
