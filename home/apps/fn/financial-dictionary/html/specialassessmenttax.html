<h1>Special Assessment Tax</h1>

<p>The levy assessed against the portion of a property that has been condemned by a public authority. The special assessment tax will reduce the amount of compensation awarded to the property owner because the owner is considered to have also benefited from the improvement.</p>

<p>A public authority can only make a partial condemnation it needs to make way for a public improvement. If the amount of the tax exceeds the compensation, then the difference is added to the basis of the property.</p>
