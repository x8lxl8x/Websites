<h1>Fixed Asset</h1>

<p>A long-term tangible piece of property that a firm owns and uses in the production of its income and is not expected to be consumed or converted into cash any sooner than at least one year's time.</p>

<p>Fixed assets are sometimes collectively referred to as "plant".</p>

<p>Buildings, real estate, equipment and furniture are good examples of fixed assets.</p>

<p>Generally, intangible long-term assets such as trademarks and patents are not categorized as fixed assets but are more specifically referred to as "fixed intangible assets".</p>
