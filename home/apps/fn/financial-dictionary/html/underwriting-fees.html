<h1>Underwriting Fees </h1>

<p>Underwriting fees are monies collected by underwriters for performing underwriting services. Underwriters work in a variety of markets including investments, mortgages and insurance. In each situation, the underwriter's jobs vary slightly yet each collects underwriting fees in exchange for his or her underwriting services.</p>

<p>In the capital markets, underwriting fees are collected by underwriters who administer the issuing and distributing of certain financial instruments. A mortgage underwriter earns underwriting fees by evaluating and verifying mortgage loan applications, and either approving or denying the loan. Insurance underwriters collect underwriting fees for identifying and calculating a policy holder's risk of loss, and by writing the policies to cover these risks.</p>
