<h1>Disability-Income (DI) Insurance</h1>

<p>An insurance product that provides supplementary income in the event of an illness or accident resulting in a disability that prevents the insured from working at their regular employment. Benefits are usually provided on a monthly basis so that the individual can maintain their standard of living and continue to pay their regular expenses.</p>

<p>aGiven the statistical likelihood of becoming injured or sick and being unable to work in one's regular occupation, DI insurance products are very useful and can be tailored to meet almost any individual's working situation.</p>
