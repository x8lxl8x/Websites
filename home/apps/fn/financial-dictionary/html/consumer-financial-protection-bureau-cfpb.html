<h1>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - CFPB</h1>

<p>A regulatory agency charged with overseeing financial products and services that are offered to consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is divided into several units, including: research, community affairs, consumer complaints, the Office of Fair Lending and the Office of Financial Opportunity. These units work together to protect and educate consumers about the various types of financial products and services that are available.</p>

<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created by the Dodd-Wall Street Reform and Protection Consumer Act of 2010. The CFPB is headed by a chief who is appointed by the President for a five-year term. The bureau is also assisted by a Consumer Advisory Council, composed of at least six members who are recommended by regional Federal Reserve presidents.</p>
