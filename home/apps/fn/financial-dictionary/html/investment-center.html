<h1>Investment Center</h1>

<p>A business unit that can utilize capital to directly contribute to a company's profitability. Companies evaluate the performance of an investment center according to the revenues it brings in through investments in capital assets compared to the overall expenses.</p>

<p>An investment center is sometimes called an investment division.</p>

<p>An investment center is different than a cost center, which indirectly adds profit and is evaluated according to the money it takes to operate. Moreover, unlike a profit center, investment centers can utilize capital in order to purchase other assets. Because of this complexity, companies have to use a variety of metrics, including return on investment (ROI), residual income and economic value added (EVA) to evaluate performance.</p>
