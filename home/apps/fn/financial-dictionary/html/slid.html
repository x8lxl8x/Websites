<h1>Student Loan Interest Deduction</h1>

<p>A tax deduction for interest paid on higher education loans during the tax year in the U.S., the deduction amount being the lesser of $2,500 or the actual interest paid. The student loan interest deduction can be claimed by the taxpayer if the student loan was taken out solely to pay qualified education expenses; the loan cannot be from a related person or made under a qualified employer plan.</p>

<p>In addition, the IRS stipulates that the student must be the taxpayer, spouse or dependent, and should be enrolled at least half-time in a degree program. Moreover, the deduction is limited by the taxpayer's income; student loan interest cannot be deducted if the taxpayer's gross income exceeds $75,000 or $150,000 if filing a joint tax return with the spouse.</p>

<p>As the student loan interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income, it is not necessary to itemize the deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040. The amount of interest paid in a given tax year can be found on Form 1098-E, which is furnished by the lender to the borrower.</p>

<p>In Canada, taxpayers can claim interest paid on student loans as a tax credit, subject to certain conditions. A Canadian taxpayer may be eligible to claim interest paid on a student loan in a given year or the preceding five years for post-secondary education, if the loan was received under the Canada Student Loans Act, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, or similar provincial or territorial government laws.</p>
