<h1>Bid Bond</h1>

<p>A debt secured by a bidder for a construction job or similar type of bid-based selection process for the purpose of providing a guarantee to the project owner that the bidder will take on the job if selected. The existence of a bid bond provides the owner with assurance that the bidder has the financial means to accept the job for the price quoted in the bid.</p>

<p>Bid bonds help the selection process of a job contract run smoothly. Without them, project owners would have little in the way of assurance that the bidder they select for a job would be able to properly complete the job without running into cash flow problems along the way. By providing bid bonds for their respective bids, each bidder for the project is able to provide sufficient assurance to the owner that the project is within its means.</p>
