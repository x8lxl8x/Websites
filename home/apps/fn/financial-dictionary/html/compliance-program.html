<h1>Compliance Program</h1>

<p>The internal programs and policy decisions made by a company in order to meet the standards set by government laws and regulations. A company will often have a compliance team that examines the rules set forth by government bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The compliance team then creates a compliance program that assures the company is following the rules. The compliance officer is responsible for ensuring the program is effectively implemented throughout the company.</p>

<p>Compliance programs have grown in importance as the regulations within many industries have increased. Overlapping regulatory agencies, financial reforms and many other factors have made compliance a full-time job for all publicly-traded companies.</p>
