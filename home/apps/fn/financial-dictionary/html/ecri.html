<h1>European Credit Research Institute - ECRI</h1>

<p>An independent research center founded by European credit institutions with the help of the Centre for European Policy Studies. It works to research the implications of certain actions relating to credit and how they will have an impact on both the micro- and macroeconomic environment. Much of the research is done through economic and policy analysis and trend monitoring.</p>

<p>In addition to the extensive research conducted at the Institute, the ECRI also provides advice to the major policymakers on issues such as credit-market regulation and credit reporting and supervision. It organizes workshops and conferences to share its members' ideas and creates an open forum for debate and discussion by all the European interest parties.</p>
