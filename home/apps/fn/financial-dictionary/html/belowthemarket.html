<h1>Below The Market</h1>

<p>An order to buy or sell a security at a price that is lower than the current market price. For example, a trader can place a limit order to buy a stock at a specified price that is below the current price. The order would only be filled if the specified price or better was available. While order execution is not guaranteed, placing an order in this manner, below the market, helps ensure that the desired price, or better, is achieved.</p>

<p>Can also be a  price or rate that is lower than the current prevailing conditions in an open market. Goods or services that are offered at a lower price than the "going," or typical, rate can be said to be below the market.</p>

<p>Traders and investors who want to try to achieve a better price or position may enter an order to buy below the market. A limit order to buy allows traders to specify the price at which they are willing to purchase a security; if the limit order to buy is filled, the order will be filled at the specified price or better. A below market order to sell allows traders to quickly unload a position.</p>

<p>Real estate properties are sometimes sold at below the market values, meaning they are offered at lower prices than comparable properties. Such properties are called BMV, below market value. Properties may be sold below their market value when the owners are faced with some type of financial difficulty such as bankruptcy, divorce, probate or if they must relocate quickly.</p>
