<h1>For Valuation Only - FVO</h1>

<p>A notation placed in front of a security's price quote denoting that it is for informational purposes, and should not be considered as an offer from the issuing party. For Valuation Only (FVO) quotes are used by market makers to help establish the value of the security. This type of notation is considered part of a nominal quotation.</p>

<p>Investors should pay attention to securities quotes to make sure that they aren't meant only for valuation, since a For Valuation Only price quote is not considered an invitation to trade and cannot be acted upon. This type of quote is given out of courtesy.</p>
