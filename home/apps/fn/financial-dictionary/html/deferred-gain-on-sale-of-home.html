<h1>Deferred Gain On Sale Of Home</h1>

<p>An obsolete tax law that applied to homeowners before May 7, 1997. The Deferred Gain on Sale of Home rule mandated that those who realized a capital gain on the sale of their residences could defer this gain if the sale proceeds were used to purchase a more expensive home. This tax deferral was called a rollover.</p>

<p>The Deferred Gain on the Sale of Home rule was superseded by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. The law now states that all homeowners can exclude up to $250,000 of capital gain on the sale of their residences from taxation unconditionally. Married couples filing jointly can exclude up to $500,000.</p>
