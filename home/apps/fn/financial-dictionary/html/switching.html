<h1>Switching</h1>

<p>1. In mutual funds, the process of transferring an investment from one fund to another.</p>

<p>2. In securities, the process of liquidating a position in exchange for other securities with better prospects for growth, yields or capital gains.</p>

<p>1. Investors may switch their assets between funds in the same family or into a different family entirely. Generally, no-load funds do not charge for these transactions. However, some brokerages may charge a commission.</p>

<p>2. When investors switch securities, they essentially use the cash received from the liquidation of their initial securities to purchase new securities.</p>

<p>In futures, an investor will switch futures contracts by closing an open position and simultaneously entering a new, similar futures contract with a longer maturity.</p>
