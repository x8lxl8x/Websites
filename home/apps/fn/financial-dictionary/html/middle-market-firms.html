<h1>Middle Market Firm</h1>

<p>A firm with sizeable annual revenues, ranging from $50 million to $1 billion. As the term implies, such a firm is one that straddles the "middle market" between the smaller companies and the billion-dollar giants. In the case of professions such as legal, accounting and brokerage, middle market firms are those that are just below the dominant firms (such as the Big Four in accounting) in their respective field.</p>

<p>The limits that define a middle market firm are not set, with some definitions setting the lower limit for annual revenues as low as $10 million, while others set the upper limit at $500 million.</p>

<p>Middle market firms are one of the pillars of the U.S. economy, since they account for a significant share of job creation. They are generally among the fastest-growing firms in terms of revenues. Publicly traded middle market firms may often be classified as mid-capitalization stocks, a segment that investors find particularly attractive because of their high-growth prospects coupled with a lower degree of risk than small-cap or speculative stocks.</p>
