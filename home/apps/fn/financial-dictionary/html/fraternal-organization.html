<h1>Fraternal Organization </h1>

<p>The term fraternal organization is from the Latin <i>frater, </i>meaning brother. A fraternal organization is a brotherhood or a type of social organization whose members freely associate for a mutually beneficial purpose such as for social, professional or honorary principles.</p>

<p>Fraternal organizations are groups that are formed based on a common bond, as with social or academic interests. Examples of fraternal organizations include college fraternities which are based on religion, previous members or just common interests. Sometimes these organizations provide great networking opportunities which allow graduates a smoother transition into the workforce.</p>
