<h1>Foreign Sales Corporation - FSC</h1>

<p>A defunct provision in the U.S. federal income tax code which allowed for reduction in taxes on income derived from sales of exported goods. The code required the use of a subsidiary entity in a foreign country which existed for the purposes of selling the exported goods. The FSC evolved from 1971 tax legislation which provided benefits for domestic international sales corporations.</p>

<p>The tax provision was disputed by several countries on the grounds that is constituted an export subsidy that was not allowed under a certain international trade treaties. The foreign sales corporation was eliminated by the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act in 2000 which introduced new rules for income not subject to U.S taxation.</p>
