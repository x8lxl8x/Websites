<h1>Kazakhstan National Fund</h1>

<p>The Kazakhstan National Fund is a sovereign wealth fund for the nation of Kazakhstan. The sovereign wealth fund originates from surplus revenues gained from taxes on the development of Algeria's oil, gas and mineral reserves. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the Kazakhstan National Fund has approximately $21.6 billion in assets as of 2008.</p>

<p>The Kazakhstan National Fund was established in 2000, primarily to act as a stabilization fund to lessen the impact that volatility in oil, gas and mineral prices have on the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan National Fund is a secretive organization and little information can be found as to its governance, holdings or investment strategies.</p>
