<h1>SEC Form 35-CERT</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be submitted by public utility holding companies to certify compliance with terms and conditions required by Rule 24 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935. This form provided investors and the SEC with detailed information about the registrant's compliance as part of the SEC's efforts to regulate public utility holding companies.</p>

<p>SEC Form 35-CERT, "certificate concerning terms and conditions", was required under Rule 24 of the PUHCA, which regulated the holding companies of electric and natural gas utilities and which was repealed on August 8, 2005. Since the act was repealed, this form is now obsolete.</p>
