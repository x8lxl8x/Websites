<h1>Mobile Payment</h1>

<p>Money rendered for a product or service through a portable electronic device such as a cell phone, smartphone or PDA. Mobile payment technology can also be used to send money to friends or family members.</p>

<p>Mobile payments first became popular in Asia and Europe before becoming more common in the United States and Canada. They can be sent (most popularly) by text message, by passing a smartphone screen displaying a special barcode under a store's barcode scanner or by using a phone to take a photo of a check and sending it. The cost of the purchase may be added to the consumer's phone bill or paid by credit or debit card.</p>

<p>In the late 2000s, public radio programs such as This American Life made use of mobile payment technology to collect donations from listeners. By texting a particular code given by the radio program to an assigned number, the listener is able to make a donation of a preset amount. That amount is added to the listener's phone bill.</p>
