<h1>Registered Education Savings Plan - RESP</h1>

<p>A savings plan sponsored by the Canadian government that encourages investing in a child's future post-secondary education. Subscribers to an RESP make contributions that build up tax-free earnings - tax-free because subscribers cannot deduct payments made to the plan from their income. The government contributes a certain amount to plans for children under 18 under the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG).</p>

<p>Payments are made by a contributor (parent) on behalf of a beneficiary (child). Once the child is in a post-secondary institution, he or she will receive educational assistance payments (EAPs). These EAPs count as income for the child (beneficiary). If the beneficiary doesn't receive payments - either by choice of the contributor or because the beneficiary does not attend a post-secondary institution, the contributor will receive the amount in the RESP back tax-free.</p>
