<h1>Economic Moat</h1>

<p>The competitive advantage that one company has over other companies in the same industry. This term was coined by renowned investor Warren Buffett.</p>

<p>The wider the moat, the larger and more sustainable the competitive advantage. By having a well-known brand name, pricing power and a large portion of market demand, a company with a wide moat possesses characteristics that act as barriers against other companies wanting to enter into the industry.</p>
