<h1>IRS Publication 530 - Tax Information For Homeowners</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that details how tax filers should treat costs relating to owning a home, including closing costs, mortgage interest, real estate taxes and repairs. IRS Publication 530 outlines which home-related items can and cannot be deducted on the tax return, and what items a taxpayer should keep track of in order to set the cost basis of the property. Some expenses, such as depreciation, closing costs, forfeited down payments and insurance, cannot be deducted.</p>

<p>Taxpayers must fill out Schedule A of Form 1040 in order to itemize home-related expenses. Itemizing deductions in this way means that the standard deduction cannot be claimed. To claim a mortgage interest credit Form 8396 (Mortgage Interest Credit) has to be used, and Form 5405 (First-Time Homebuyer Credit and Repayment of the Credit) for credits relating to the purchase of a new home.</p>
