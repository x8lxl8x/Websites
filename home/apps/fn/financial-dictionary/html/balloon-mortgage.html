<h1>Balloon Mortgage</h1>

<p>A type of short-term mortgage. Balloon mortgages require borrowers to make regular payments for a specific interval, then pay off the remaining balance within a relatively short time. Some types of balloon mortgages can be interest-only for 10 years, and the final "balloon" payment to pay off the balance comes as one large installment at the end of the term.</p>

<p>Balloon mortgages have the option for early repayment or can be set up similar to a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with the embedded option. The total debt repayment of these loans is lower than that of conventional fixed-rate mortgages. Balloon mortgages take the form of interest-only loans or partially amortizing mortgages.</p>
