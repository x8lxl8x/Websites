<h1>Contingent Beneficiary</h1>

<p>1. A beneficiary specified by an insurance contract holder who will receive the benefits if the primary beneficiary has died at the time the benefit is to be paid.</p>

<p>2. A beneficiary who is only entitled to insurance proceeds if predetermined conditions have been met at the time of the insured's death (as can be found in a will).</p>

<p>Contingent and primary beneficiaries can be changed if the policy is a revocable one, such as with many individual policies. In the business world, most policies are irrevocable, as they are only meant to insure the person(s) originally specified as beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Virtually any conditions may be in place for a contingent beneficiary of a will as this depends entirely on the person drafting the will.</p>
