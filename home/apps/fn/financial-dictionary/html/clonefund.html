<h1>Clone Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that aims to replicate the performance or strategy of a larger, successful mutual fund. A clone fund may be set up by a mutual fund company when the original fund has grown too big to be managed efficiently, or if the company wishes to introduce a different pricing structure. In Canada, clone funds referred specifically to funds that used derivatives to bypass the foreign content restriction that previously existed in retirement accounts.</p>

<p>While the investment objective of a clone fund is to match the performance of the original fund, its actual performance may differ, depending on a number of factors, such as whether the portfolio manager/s are the same for both funds, and the differences (if any) in investment style and trade execution for the two funds.</p>

<p>Clone funds were popular in Canada earlier because the amount of foreign content in registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) was restricted, until a legislative change in 2005 eliminated the 30% foreign content limit. When the foreign content restrictions were in effect, a Canadian investor who wished to invest in the S&P 500, but was already at the 30% limit in his or her RRSP, could do so by investing in an S&P 500 clone fund offered by a number of Canadian mutual fund companies. While these funds were devised to replicate the performance of the S&P 500, they were classified as Canadian property since their main assets consisted of derivatives trading in Canada.</p>
