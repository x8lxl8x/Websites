<h1>Invisible Assets</h1>

<p>An item of value that is intangible and that cannot be seen, such as brand recognition and intellectual property including trademarks, copyrights or patents. Invisible assets are non-material assets that are shown in a company's balance sheet, and include research and development costs, concessions, patents, licenses, trademarks and goodwill. Also called intangible assets.</p>

<p>The value of invisible assets may be difficult to quantify; however, these assets can be important to the long-term success of a company (consider the Nike "swoosh" logo and brand recognition). An invisible (or intangible) asset is the opposite of a tangible asset, such as cash, a factory or real estate.</p>
