<h1>Absolute Return</h1>

<p>The return that an asset achieves over a certain period of time. This measure looks at the appreciation or depreciation (expressed as a percentage) that an asset - usually a stock or a mutual fund - achieves over a given period of time.</p>

<p>Absolute return differs from relative return because it is concerned with the return of a particular asset and does not compare it to any other measure or benchmark.</p>

<p>In general, a mutual fund seeks to produce returns that are better that its peers, its fund category, and/or the market as a whole. This type of fund management is referred to as a relative return approach to fund investing. As an investment vehicle, an absolute return fund seeks to make positive returns by employing investment management techniques that differ from traditional mutual funds.</p>

<p>Absolute return investment techniques include using short selling, futures, options, derivatives, arbitrage, leverage and unconventional assets.</p>

<p>Alfred Winslow Jones is credited with forming the first absolute return fund in New York in 1949. In recent years, this so-called absolute return approach to fund investing has become one of the fastest growing investment products in the world and is more commonly referred to as a hedge fund.</p>
