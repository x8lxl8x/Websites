<h1>Accumulated Depreciation</h1>

<p>The cumulative depreciation of an asset up to a single point in its life. Regardless of the method used to calculate it, the depreciation of an asset during a single period is added to the previous period's accumulated depreciation to get the current accumulated depreciation.</p>

<p>An asset's carrying value on the balance sheet is the difference between its purchase price and accumulated depreciation.</p>

<p>A company buys an asset for $5,000 that has a five-year lifespan and zero salvage value. The company uses straight-line depreciation, and the asset depreciates at a rate of $1,000 per year.</p>

<p>In year one, depreciation will be $1,000, as will accumulated depreciation, and carrying value of the asset will be $4,000.</p>

<p>In year two, depreciation will be $1,000, accumulated depreciation will be $2,000 ($1,000 from the current year + $1,000 accumulated from previous years) and carrying value will be $3,000.</p>

<p>Each subsequent year will follow the same process.</p>
