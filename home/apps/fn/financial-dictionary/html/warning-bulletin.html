<h1>Warning Bulletin</h1>

<p>A listing compiled on a weekly basis of credit cards that have been canceled, are past due or have been reported stolen credit card.</p>

<p>Also known as the "Hot List."</p>

<p>The warning bulletin was created by the two biggest credit card vendors, MasterCard and Visa.</p>

<p>Technological advances have led to the replacement of paper bulletins with online terminals that provide instant notification of suspect accounts or invalid bank cards to processing merchants. For example, if a stolen credit card is used the terminal might produce a message stating that the card is listed on the Warning Bulletin.</p>
