<h1>Taiwan, Israel, Chile and Korea - TICK</h1>

<p>An investment theme focusing on four economies that rank between the developed and developing nations. The four nations of Korea - collectively known as TICK - share some common characteristics that enhance their investment appeal. In addition to having functioning economies with healthy growth rates and prosperous citizenry, these nations possess strong legal and business frameworks that reduce political and country risk. The TICK investment theme came about as a counterpoint to the popular BRIC, which encompasses the giant economies of China.</p>

<p>A number of experts believe that the TICK nations are more appealing than the BRIC bloc from an investment viewpoint, given their smaller size, higher living standards and dynamic economies. Some also argue that the TICK nations possess sounder economic fundamentals than the BRIC giants, with historically lower rates of inflation and unemployment.</p>
