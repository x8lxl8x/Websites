<h1>Six Forces Model</h1>

<p>A strategic business tool that helps businesses evaluate the competitiveness and attractiveness of a market. The six force model provides an industry-view and analyzes six key areas:</p>

<p>Competition - Information regarding present competition
New Entrants - Information regarding the ease with which new competition could enter the market
End Users/Buyers - Information regarding the buyers' abilities to affect price
Suppliers - The number and type of sellers
Substitutes - The ease by which a product or service can be substituted
Complementary Products - The impact of related products and services already in the market</p>

<p>The five forces model was originally developed by Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School. The six force model later came in the mid-1990s and added complementary products. It is used to evaluate a firm's strategic position in a particular marketplace. The Six Force Model can also be used to determine the market's overall attractiveness in relation to profitability and competition.</p>
