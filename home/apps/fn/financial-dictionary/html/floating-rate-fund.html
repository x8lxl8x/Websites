<h1>Floating Rate Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that invests in financial instruments with a variable or floating interest rate. A floating rate fund invests in bonds and debt instruments whose coupons fluctuate in line with the underlying level of interest rates, as opposed to fixed-rate coupons. The biggest advantage of a floating rate fund is its lower degree of sensitivity to changes in interest rates compared with a fund or instrument with a fixed coupon rate. Floating rate funds appeal to investors when interest rates are rising, since this will result in a higher level of interest or coupon payments. They are far less appealing when interest rates are declining.</p>

<p>The coupon rates payable on a floating rate instrument held within a floating rate fund will vary in line with a defined interest rate benchmark known as the reference rate. The reference rate that is used as a basis to adjust the coupon rate is generally a widely followed benchmark such as LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate), the U.S. federal funds rate or the prime rate.</p>

<p>Apart from their lower sensitivity to interest rate changes and ability to reflect current interest rates, a floating rate fund enables an investor to diversify fixed-income investments, since fixed-rate instruments comprise the majority of bond holdings for most investors. Another benefit is that a floating rate fund enables an investor to acquire a diversified bond portfolio at a relatively low investment threshold, since most bonds are only available in large dollar amounts. A floating rate fund may also mitigate credit risk by holding bonds from a number of issuers. This diversified fund portfolio may have a lower degree of credit risk compared to a fixed-income portfolio that only has a couple of issuers.</p>

<p>In evaluating a floating rate fund, investors must ensure that the bonds the fund holds are adequate for their risk tolerance level. For example, an 80-year-old investor whose primary objective is capital preservation would be ill-advised to invest in a floating rate fund that invests primarily in speculative-grade bonds, since it may be susceptible to a higher degree of credit risk and significant price volatility.</p>
