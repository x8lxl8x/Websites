<h1>At Sight</h1>

<p>A payment due on demand. An at sight payment will require the party receiving the good or service to pay a certain sum immediately upon being presented with the bill of exchange.</p>

<p>Also known as a "sight draft" or a "sight bill".</p>

<p>This term is used most often in legal contracts to describe when payment is to be made. A seller might place an at-sight clause in a contract to demand full payment at sight. A seller might enforce this if the buyer has missed payments in the past, and is deemed to have a higher risk of default.</p>
