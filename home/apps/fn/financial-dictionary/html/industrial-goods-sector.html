<h1>Industrial Goods Sector</h1>

<p>A category of stocks that relate to producing goods used in construction and manufacturing. This sector includes companies involved with aerospace and defense, industrial machinery, tools, lumber production, construction, cement and metal fabrication.</p>

<p>Performance in the industrial goods sector is largely driven by supply and demand for building construction - residential, commercial and industrial - as well as the demand for manufactured products. When the economy contracts and consumers save more and spend less, activity in this sector drops because companies will postpone expansion and produce fewer goods.</p>

<p>The performance of the industrial goods sector closely follows the performance of the S&P 500.</p>
