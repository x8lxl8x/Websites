<h1>Expiration Cycle</h1>

<p>The calendar cycle of expiration months that is assigned to basic exchange-traded stock options. With a few exceptions (some options will have contracts in every month), most equity options are set up to trade with expiration months in one of the following three formats:</p>

<p>January Cycle: Expirations in January, April, July, October (the first month of each quarter)</p>

<p>February Cycle: Expirations in February, May, August, November (second month)</p>

<p>March Cycle: Expirations in March, June, September, December (third month)</p>

<p>Some options may have contracts in every month of the year, but this is usually reserved for highly liquid underlying securities, such as ETFs on the S&P 500. Options such as these are often used to hedge a portfolio and, because they represent a basket of stocks, the security is more stable. The strike prices tend to hold up better as a result.</p>

<p>With single stock options, a given strike price that once seemed valuable can quickly become obsolete, such as a $25 strike price in a call option on a stock that drops suddenly from $27 to $15 over the course of a month.</p>

<p>LEAPS are not subject to standard expiration cycles because they are derivative contracts that are one year or more away from expiration.</p>
