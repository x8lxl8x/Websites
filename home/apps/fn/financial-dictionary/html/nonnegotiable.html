<h1>Non-Negotiable</h1>

<p>1. A term relating to the price of a good or security which is firmly established and cannot be adjusted.</p>

<p>2. A term relating to a good or security whose ownership is not easily transferable from one party to another.</p>

<p>1. When an asking price is considered non-negotiable, it means that you cannot try to change the price as it has been firmly established.</p>

<p>2. Securities and products that are considered non-negotiable cannot be transferred from one party to the next and thus are typically illiquid.</p>

<p>An example of a non-negotiable instrument would be a government savings bond. These can only be redeemed by the owner of the bond and are not allowed to be sold to other parties.</p>

<p>Also known as registered securities, non-marketable or non-transferable securities.</p>
