<h1>Fade</h1>

<p>1. A contrarian investment strategy used to trade against the prevailing trend. "Fading the market" is typically very high risk, requiring the trader to have a high risk tolerance. A fade trader would sell when a price is rising and buy when it's falling. Also known as "fading".</p>

<p>2. In a dealer market, it is the failure of a dealer to honor a quote when a customer or another dealer wants to trade.</p>

<p>1. An example of fading would include buying on a dip in price and selling when the price rallies. Often it's a rather volatile strategy, but one which offers the potential for significant short-term gains. It requires little in the way of complicated analysis but the risk that trend continues is always present.</p>

<p>2. For example, if a better bid is posted on another exchange for a security and a market maker is unwilling or unable to match it for a client order, the market maker may offer to trade with the other market maker (with the better price). The market maker offering the better price must accept the offer and trade at the price offered or adjust the bid price.</p>
