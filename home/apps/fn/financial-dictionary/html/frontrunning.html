<h1>Front Running</h1>

<p>The unethical practice of a broker trading an equity based on information from the analyst department before his or her clients have been given the information.</p>

<p>For example, analysts and brokers who buy up shares in a company just before the brokerage is about to recommended the stock as a strong buy are practicing front running.</p>

<p>Another example is a broker who buys himself 200 shares in a stock just before his or her brokerage plans to buy a large block of 400,000 shares.</p>
