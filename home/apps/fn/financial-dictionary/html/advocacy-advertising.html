<h1>Advocacy Advertising</h1>

<p>The use of marketing used to support a particular message or cause. Unlike commercial advertising, advocacy advertising is considered to be undertaken in the interest of a group or the public, and typically does not promote a product or service. Funding for advocacy advertising can be through non-profit organizations, by corporations or private advocacy groups. Some governments require that organizations engaging in advocacy advertising clearly state how the funding is provided.</p>

<p>An example of advocacy advertising is funding for cancer research. An organization may run paid advertisements on television in order to raise money through donations, and state that donations will be used to pay for drugs and treatments to combat cancer. This type of advertising is prevalent during major political elections, as various corporations and interest groups campaign for or against candidates.</p>
