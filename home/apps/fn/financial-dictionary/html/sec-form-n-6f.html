<h1>SEC Form N-6F </h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be submitted by a company intending to file a notification of election to be subject to sections 55 through 65 of the Act within ninety days of the date of this filing. The company would be excluded from the definition of an investment company by section 3(c)(1) of the Act, except that it presently proposes to make a public offering of its securities as a business development company. Sections 55-65 deal with acquisition of assets by business development companies, qualification of directors, transactions with certain affiliates, changes in investment policy, incorporation of title provisions, functions and activities of business development companies, capital structure, loans, distrubution and repurchase of securities, accounts and records, and preventing compliance with title.</p>

<p>Form N-6F is also called "Notice of Intent to Elect to be Subject to Sections 55-65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940." The form should not be filed by a company that at the time of filing has more than 100 beneficial owners of its securities, or by a company that expects to have more than one hundred beneficial owners of its securities before a notification of election will be filed. Such a company should consider whether or not it needs to file a notification of registration under section 8(a) of the Act or a notification of election under section 54(a) of the Act.</p>
