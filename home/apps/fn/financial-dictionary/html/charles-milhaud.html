<h1>Charles Milhaud</h1>

<p>Charles Milhaud held various positions at Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Épargne since 1964, including president. Milhaud led the Caisses d'Épargne to a large increase in size while still achieving good returns. He helped turned a small savings bank into one of the largest banking groups in France. However, Milhaud's tenure was cut short by a 600 million euro trading loss that forced him to resign after spending his entire career with the company.</p>

<p>In addition to his career with Caisses d'Epargne, Milhaud has served on the board of directors at numerous other companies. Milhauds management style can be seen in one of his quotes: "I don't like to manage. I like to build". This is consistent with the mergers Milhaud pursued to grow the company.</p>
