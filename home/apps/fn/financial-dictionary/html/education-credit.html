<h1>Education Credit</h1>

<p>A type of tax credit available to students of a post-secondary educational institution, such as a college or university. Education credits may be claimed by those who incur qualifying educational expenses, such as tuition and fees. Parents who pay these expenses for their children may be able to claim this type of credit on their tax returns, subject to certain income restrictions.</p>

<p>There are two types of education credits, the Hope Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit. The Hope Credit applies to first and second year postsecondary students, with certain restrictions. The Lifetime Learning Credit applies to all students at the undergraduate or graduate level. You cannot claim both the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits for the same student in the same year.</p>
