<h1>Roger Enrico</h1>

<p>A former CEO of PepsiCo from 1996 to 2001, chairman from 2001 to 2003 and later chairman of Dreamworks Animation. Enrico began working for PepsiCo in its Frito-Lay division in 1971, as an associate brand manager. He then worked in the company's Japanese and Latin American divisions before he became president and CEO of Pepsi's U.S. beverage division in 1983.</p>

<p>As the CEO of the U.S. division, Enrico created the famous Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign that dramatically increased Pepsi sales and spurred Pepsi's main competitor to create New Coke - a very unsuccessful move for Coca Cola. Enrico later worked as CEO of PepsiCo's Frito Lay division and its restaurant division, which owned Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, before becoming CEO of the entire company.</p>

<p>Enrico was born in 1944 in Minnesota. He began his career with General Mills and also served in Vietnam before joining PepsiCo. He has been a board member with The National Geographic Society, the Environmental Defense Fund and the American Film Institute</p>
