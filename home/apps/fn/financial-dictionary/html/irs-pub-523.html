<h1>IRS Publication 523</h1>

<p>A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that outlines the tax rules applying to the sale of a home. For this document, "home" specifically relates to a principal residence where the taxpayer lives most of the time. Taxpayers may be eligible to exclude all or part of the gain from the sale of a principal residence from income.</p>

<p>In order to exclude gains the homeowner must meet both an ownership test and a use test. The ownership test requires that an individual has owned the home for at least two of the last five years; the use test requires that an individual has lived in the home as a primary residence for two of the past five years.</p>

<p>Gains that cannot be excluded are taxable; losses on the sale of a home cannot be deducted.</p>

<p>Because taxes related to homeownership are a politically sensitive subject, taxpayers should pay close attention to IRS Publication 523 because it may change more frequently than other IRS publications.</p>

<p>Members of the armed forces, the disabled and persons displaced due to home destruction or condemnation may be excepted from ownership and use rules.</p>
