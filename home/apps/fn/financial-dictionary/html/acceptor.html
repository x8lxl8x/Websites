<h1>Acceptor</h1>

<p>The acceptor is the third party who accepts responsibility for payment in a bill of exchange drawn upon it. The bill of exchange will generally have three parties:  the drawor, the drawee and the acceptor.</p>

<p>The simplest example of an acceptor is a bank who accepts a check drawn against it and assumes responsibility for payment of the check. Company XYZ has paid Electric Company ABC through a check drawn against Bank DEF. When Electric Company ABC presents the check for payment, and the bank agrees to pay the check, it becomes the "acceptor."</p>
