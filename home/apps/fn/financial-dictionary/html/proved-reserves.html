<h1>Proved Reserves</h1>

<p>A classification used in mining sectors that refers to the amount of resources that can be recovered from the deposit with a reasonable level of certainty. Proved reserves is a common metric quoted by companies such as oil, natural gas, coal and other commodity-based companies.</p>

<p>Also known as proven reserves.</p>

<p>Proved reserves are usually determined through extensive geologic and engineering studies. It can take mining companies several years to complete a study to determine the amount of proven resources. A company that increases its level of proven resources over time generally sees a favorable response in the price of its shares.</p>
