<h1>Claims Adjuster </h1>

<p>Someone who investigates insurance claims to determine the extent of the insuring company's liability. Claims adjusters may handle property claims involving damage to structures, and/or liability claims involving personal injuries or third-person property damage. A claims adjuster reviews each case by speaking with the claimant, interviewing any witnesses, researching records (such as police or medical records) and inspecting any involved property.</p>

<p>Claims adjusters review insurance claims to verify the claim and to determine a fair amount for settlement. For example, if an insured homeowner makes an insurance claim due to a tree falling on the house, a claims adjuster would interview the claimant (homeowner) and any witnesses and inspect the property to determine the extent of the damage, and the costs of repairing the property. The claims adjuster then submits to the insurance company documentation describing the incident and recommendations for the claim amount (how much money the insured will receive from the insurance company to repair the property).</p>
