<h1>SEC Form 1-E</h1>

<p>A notification form required by the SEC. This form lists all relevant information pertaining to a small business issuer of securities, including data on its principals, location and size, among other things. Affiliates, directors and officers and jurisdiction of issuance are also covered.</p>

<p>This form is required under SEC regulation E, and was last updated in 2001. It is ultimately an extension of the Securities Act of 1933, except that it is geared for small business issuers instead of large corporations. The form is ancillary to Form 1-A, the Regulation A offering statement.</p>
