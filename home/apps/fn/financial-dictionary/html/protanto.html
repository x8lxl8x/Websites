<h1>Pro-Tanto</h1>

<p>A Latin phrase meaning "for so much" which is often associated with a partial payment on a legal claim. A pro-tanto payment or settlement does not mean that an entire obligation has been met, but may provide the party paying the claim to avoid more extreme legal problems, such as bankruptcy.</p>

<p>An example of a pro-tanto legal settlement would involve eminent domain. A local government looking to build a highway uses the power of eminent domain to seize land along the proposed route, and partially pays the owner of the property for the land. This payment does not mean that the landowner has no option to counter-claim.</p>
