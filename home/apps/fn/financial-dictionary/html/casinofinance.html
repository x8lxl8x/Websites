<h1>Casino Finance</h1>

<p>A slang term for an investment strategy that is considered extremely risky. Casino finance refers to casinos and gambling, where players may have little to no control over the outcome of their bets. The terms often refers to large "bets" on investments that are typically high risk, with an anticipated high potential reward outcome. However, as with betting at a casino, the investor could "lose it all".</p>

<p>Casino finance generally refers to high dollar bets in the markets, either involving high risk investments, and/or high leveraged accounts. Investors who employ these tactics are usually taking large risks in order to attempt to earn large rewards. While most investors prefer a more conservative approach, some investors are comfortable undertaking a large amount of risk, in order to have the opportunity to secure large returns.</p>
