<h1>Transit Item</h1>

<p>Any check or draft that is issued by an institution other than the bank where it was initially deposited. Transit items are separated from checks that were written by a bank's own customers. They are submitted to the drawee bank through either direct presentation or via a local clearing house.</p>

<p>Transit items can also be presented to the drawee bank through one of the Federal Reserve Banks or a regional check-processing center. These checks are usually drawn and sorted by banks before their own checks are processed.</p>
