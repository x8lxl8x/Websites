<h1>Rainbow Option</h1>

<p>A single option linked to two or more underlying assets. In order for the option to pay off, <i>all</i> the underlying assets must move in the intended direction.</p>

<p>The underlying securities can have different characteristics, such as expiry date and strike price, but all must move in the way the option holder has bet they will.</p>

<p>Here's a sports-betting analogy that demonstrates a rainbow option: suppose you're at a baseball tournament with three fields backing one another. One game is halfway through, a second is just starting and a third starts in an hour. A type of bet that's analogous to a rainbow option is one that earns you a profit if you pick all three winners, but gets you  nothing if any one team you pick is a loser.</p>
