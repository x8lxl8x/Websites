<h1>Joint Owned Property</h1>

<p>Any property held in the name of two or more parties. The two parties could be a husband and wife, business partners or any other combination of people who have a reason to own property together. Property that is jointly owned may be held in one of several legal forms including joint tenancy, tenancy by the entirety, community property or in a trust.</p>

<p>Choosing the best form of ownership for joint property can greatly simplify things if one of the owners die. For example, joint tenancy is commonly used to avoid probate, a lengthy, costly and public process of distributing the deceased's assets in court.</p>

<p>To prevent a conflict, if one party wants to sell their interest in the property at some point in the future, the owners should sign a buyout agreement, ideally when the property is first taken into joint ownership.</p>
