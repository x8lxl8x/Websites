<h1>Assignment</h1>

<p>1. The transfer of an individual's rights or property to another person or business.</p>

<p>2. A notice received by an option writer stating that the option sold has been exercised by the purchaser of the option.</p>

<p>1. Essentially, an assignment is the transfer of ownership. An example of an assignment is when a person sells his or her car, thereby transferring the title to another.</p>

<p>2. When assigned, the option writer has an obligation to complete the requirements of the option contract. If the option was a call (put) option, then the writer would have to sell (buy) the underlying security at the stated strike price.</p>
