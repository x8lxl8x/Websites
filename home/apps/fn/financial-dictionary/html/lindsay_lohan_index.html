<h1>Lindsay Lohan Stock Index</h1>

<p>A stock index comprised of companies associated with actress Lindsay Lohan. Investors might correlate the popularity of Lohan with increased sales surrounding her related products. Firms involved with Lohan endorsements, advertising or movies are included in the index.</p>

<p>Fans may see Lindsay Lohan use a certain product, such as her Mercedes Benz, and rush to purchase one for themselves. The increased demand will usually drive up a company's sales, merely for being associated with Lohan. Companies involved in the index include Disney, who produce many of Lohan's films, Daimler Chrysler and Mattel.</p>

<p>As with most celebrity-related terms, buzz words such as this usually have a shorter shelf life and may become irrelevant.</p>
