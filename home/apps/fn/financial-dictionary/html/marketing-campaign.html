<h1>Marketing Campaign</h1>

<p>Specific activities designed to promote a product, service or business. A marketing campaign is a coordinated series of steps that can include promotion of a product through different mediums (television, radio, print, online) using a variety of different types of advertisements. The campaign doesn't have to rely solely on advertising, and can also include demonstrations, word of mouth and other interactive techniques.</p>

<p>Businesses operating in highly competitive markets may find themselves initiating frequent marketing campaigns and devoting significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales. Marketing campaigns can be designed with different ends in mind, including building a brand image, introducing a new product, increasing sales of a product already on the market, or even reducing the impact of negative news.</p>
