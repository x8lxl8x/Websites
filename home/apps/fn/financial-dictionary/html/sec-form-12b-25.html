<h1>SEC Form 12b-25</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Notification of Late Filing. It is used when a company anticipates that other key filings will not be completed by their deadlines. By filing Form 12b-25 in a timely manner, a company may avoid further penalties associated with failing to file their required forms. Included on the form is a description of why the late filing is taking place and whether or not the company expects any major surprises compared to its prior year's filing.</p>

<p>The SEC Form 12b-25 is usually a red flag for investors, indicating that something is not right with a company. It either means that management is incapable of ensuring that basic tasks are performed or that the company is experiencing major financial trouble. Since the SEC Form 12b-25 requires companies to indicate whether or not any major changes from the prior year's report are expected, it is crucial that investors review this filing as soon as they become aware of it.</p>
