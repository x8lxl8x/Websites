<h1>Account History</h1>

<p>All activity within an account, usually since inception. In a bank account, the account history includes all transactions initiated by the account holder as well as passive entries (such as interest on balances, which are credited to the account). The account history is also called a "ledger", depending on where the account is held.</p>

<p>Account histories can be a very important tool for credit card companies to identify fraud or identity theft, particularly when transactions are out of the ordinary in terms of their amount or place of purchase. Account history is recorded on the account statement, which is an important document to retain.</p>

<p>Most checking, savings and brokerage accounts will send a monthly statement to account holders. This statement should include the account history for that month.</p>
