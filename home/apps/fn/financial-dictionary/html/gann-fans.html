<h1>Gann Fans</h1>

<p>A form of technical analysis based on the ideas that the market is geometric and cyclical in nature. A Gann fan consists of a series of diagonal lines called Gann angles, of which there are nine. These angles are superimposed over a price chart to show a security's support and resistance levels. The resulting image is supposed to help technical analysts predict price changes. Although once drawn by hand, today Gann fans can be drawn with software programs.</p>

<p>Gann Fans were developed by W. D. Gann, who was also known for his accurate financial predictions, called the Gann studies, in the early 1900s. Gann's ideal angle was a 45 degree angle based on his ideal balance of time and price. However, because the construction of a Gann fan relies heavily on subjective choices made by individual traders, the chart may be limited in its usefulness and accuracy. The three premises Gann based his theory on were: i) price, time and range are the only factors, ii) cyclical markets, and iii) geometric market design.</p>
