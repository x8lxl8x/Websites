<h1>Active Stocks</h1>

<p>Listed shares on an exchange that are heavily traded. Active stocks are actively bought and sold, and often have a large number of shares outstanding. Because they are heavily traded, active stocks often have low bid-ask spreads as a result of their increased liquidity.</p>

<p>The most active stocks are listed each day with the volume and the day's gain or loss. They could be actively traded because they have a large number of shares outstanding, or because of a special situation such as there being a tender offer for the company or because of unexpected news.</p>
