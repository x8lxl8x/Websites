<h1>Lease Extension</h1>

<p>A legal agreement that extends the term of a rental agreement. The lease extension document should name the parties to the agreement, provide the dates on which the extension begins and ends, and reference the earlier agreement that is being extended. Lease payments do not have to remain the same under a lease extension.</p>

<p>A lease extension could be executed between a landlord and a tenant, when the tenant's lease is about to expire and he or she wants to continue renting the property. Another situation where a lease extension might be desirable is if a consumer is leasing a vehicle from an auto dealership and opts to lease or purchase a different vehicle at the end of the lease term, but wants to temporarily continue using the original leased vehicle because the replacement vehicle is not yet available.</p>
