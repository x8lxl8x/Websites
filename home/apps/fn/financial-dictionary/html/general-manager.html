<h1>General Manager</h1>

<p>The person in charge of a department within a company. General managers commonly rank above most employees but below corporate-level executives. The responsibility and importance associated with the position varies from company to company, depending on the structure of its corporate ladder. In some companies, the general manager is one of the top executives.</p>

<p>A general manager will usually have experience in a lower-level management position before being hired as or promoted to general manager. General managers can advance by moving into top executive positions or by moving to larger and more prestigious companies. They must have a thorough understanding of their departments or company's operations, be skilled at managing and leading the employees they supervise and make sound decisions for the company.</p>
