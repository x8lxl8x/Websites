<h1>Housing Policy Council - HPC</h1>

<p>A subsidiary of the Financial Services Roundtable, formed in 2003, in recognition of the fact that many roundtable members are directly involved in providing mortgage credit to American consumers. The Housing Policy Council (HPC) is a strong lobbying force in D.C., weighing in on numerous housing and mortgage-related topics including federal home loan bank modernization efforts, government sponsored enterprise (GSE) regulatory reform, uniform national financial standards, home mortgage disclosure act (HMDA) data standards and reporting, low-income housing tax credit, the mortgage interest deduction, mortgage revenue bonds and many more.</p>

<p>The Housing Policy Council also provides mortgage credit for consumers nationwide. It approximates that member firms of the HPC originate 65% of all mortgages in the U.S. Senior mortgage executives from member firms sit on the Housing Policy Council leadership board.</p>

<p>The Housing Policy Council was instrumental in creating the HOPE NOW Alliance to help stem the help tide of mortgage foreclosures created by the subprime mortgage market meltdown in '07-'08.</p>
