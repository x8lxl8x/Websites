<h1>Asset Allocation Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that provides investors with a portfolio of a fixed or variable mix of the three main asset classes - stocks, bonds and cash equivalents - in a variety of securities. Some asset allocation funds maintain a specific proportion of asset classes over time, while others vary the proportional composition in response to changes in the economy and investment markets.</p>

<p>Asset allocation mutual funds come in several varieties. Generally, a "balanced fund" implies a fixed mixed of stocks and bonds, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds. "Life-cycle" or "target-date" funds, which are often used in retirement plans, usually have a mix of stocks, bonds and cash equivalent securities that starts out with a higher risk-return position and gradually become less risky as the investor ages and/or nears retirement. So-called "life-style," or actively-managed asset-allocation funds provide the active management of a fund's asset classes in response to market conditions.</p>
