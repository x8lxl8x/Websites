<h1>Comparative Advertising</h1>

<p>A marketing strategy in which a company shows how its product or service is superior to that of its competitors by comparing the benefits and costs within the advertisement itself. A comparative advertising campaign may involve printing a side-by-side comparison of the features of a company's products next to those of its competitor.</p>

<p>Comparative advertising is not used solely for the promotion of a product or service. It has become a common technique used in political advertisements, with one candidate listing how he or she would not have made the same specific decisions as the incumbent if elected. This type of advertising is popular with companies releasing new products, as the focus of the ad will be how the new product is better than products already on the market.</p>
