<h1>Non-Resident</h1>

<p>An individual who mainly resides in one region or jurisdiction but has interests in another region. In the region where he or she does not mainly reside, he or she will be classified by government authorities as a non-resident. The classification itself will be determined in each region based on set circumstances such as the amount of time spent within the region during the calendar year. This classification is focused on where the person resides and does not focus on citizenship.</p>

<p>For example, many individuals live in one state but have business in another region and derive income from sources within that region. If a non-resident generates taxable income within another region, he or she will have to file a separate tax return within the region compared to residents of that region. In other cases, a non-resident may have to pay more to go to college in a state where he or she does not primarily reside.</p>
