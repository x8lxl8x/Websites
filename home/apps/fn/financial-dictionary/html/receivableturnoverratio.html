<h1>Receivables Turnover Ratio</h1>

<p>An accounting measure used to quantify a firm's effectiveness in extending credit as well as collecting debts. The receivables turnover ratio is an activity ratio, measuring how efficiently a firm uses its assets.</p>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>Some companies' reports will only show sales - this can affect the ratio depending on the size of cash sales.
By maintaining accounts receivable, firms are indirectly extending interest-free loans to their clients. A high ratio implies either that a company operates on a cash basis or that its extension of credit and collection of accounts receivable is efficient.</p>

<p>A low ratio implies the company should re-assess its credit policies in order to ensure the timely collection of imparted credit that is not earning interest for the firm.</p>
