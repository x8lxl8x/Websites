<h1>Negotiable</h1>

<p>1. Describing the price of a good or security that is not firmly established.</p>

<p>2. Describing a good or security whose ownership is easily transferable from one party to another.</p>

<p>1. You will often hear the term "negotiable" in reference to the purchase price of a particular good. The term states that the asking price is not set in stone and can be adjusted depending on the circumstance.</p>

<p>2. Most securities are negotiable, which means that they can be easily transferred from one party to the next, provided all proper documentation is included.</p>

<p>An example of a negotiable instrument would be a certificate of deposit. These can be easily bought and sold between different parties.</p>

<p>Also known as "marketable", "transferable" or "un-registered".</p>
