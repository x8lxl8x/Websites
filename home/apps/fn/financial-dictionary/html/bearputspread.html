<h1>Bear Put Spread</h1>

<p>A type of options strategy used when an option trader expects a decline in the price of the underlying asset. Bear Put Spread is achieved by purchasing put options at a specific strike price while also selling the same number of puts at a lower strike price. The maximum profit to be gained using this strategy is equal to the difference between the two strike prices, minus the net cost of the options.</p>

<p>For example, let's assume that a stock is trading at $30. An option trader can use a bear put spread by purchasing one put option contract with a strike price of $35 for a cost of $475 ($4.75 * 100 shares/contract) and selling one put option contract with a strike price of $30 for $175 ($1.75 * 100 shares/contract). In this case, the investor will need to pay a total of $300 to set up this strategy ($475 - $175). If the price of the underlying asset closes below $30 upon expiration, then the investor will realize a total profit of $200 (($35 - $30 * 100 shares/contract) - ($475 - $175)).</p>
