<h1>Wage Assignment</h1>

<p>The procedure of taking money directly from an employee's compensation under the authority of a court order, in order to pay a debt obligation. Wage assignments are typically a last resort of a lender to receive repayment from a borrower who has previously failed to pay their debt obligation.</p>

<p>Typical reasons for a wage assignment may be items such child support payments, court fines and taxes that have gone unpaid for a prolonged period of time. Once mandated by a court and served to an employer, wage assignments are processed as part of an employer's payroll procedure -- the employee's regular paycheck is decreased by the amount of the assignment and noted on their pay stub.</p>

<p>Employees may sometimes be able to voluntarily undergo wage assignment to pay for things like union dues or contribute to a retirement fund.</p>
