<h1>Call Deposit Account</h1>

<p>A bank account for investment funds that offers the advantages of both a savings and a checking account. A call deposit account, like a checking account, has no fixed deposit period, provides instant access to funds and allows unlimited withdrawals and deposits. Like a savings account, a call deposit account pays interest. The rate of interest a call deposit account pays depends on the amount of money in the account, a system commonly referred to as banded interest rates. Also, different currencies may earn different interest rates. Depositors may have to meet a minimum balance threshold before they earn any interest.
Call deposit accounts allow investors to deposit and withdraw funds in several currencies, which commonly include the U.S. dollar, the euro and the British pound. This flexibility reduces investors' exposure to foreign exchange expenses and currency risk. Call deposit accounts often have minimum deposit requirements to establish an account and may have minimum daily balance requirements, too.</p>
