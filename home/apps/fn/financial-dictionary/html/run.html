<h1>Run</h1>

<p>A series of price movements that occur in the same direction for a particular security, sector or index. A run is a prolonged uptrend or downtrend characterized by daily gains (uptrend) or daily losses (downtrend). For example, if a particular stock's price increased each day for five trading sessions, the stock would be said to be in a run. If the run occurs as a result of rising prices, it can also be called a rally, and in particular, a bull rally. If prices are dropping, the run would be referred to as a bear market rally.</p>

<p>A run to the upside is typically the result of a large amount of money entering the market and bidding up the prices. A run to the downside, on the other hand, may be the result of such factors as investors taking profits. Fundamental factors, technical factors and market sentiment all have an effect on securities' prices and can help push prices in the same direction for a period of time, creating a run. If a stock has been experiencing a period of rising prices, it might be reported that, "Stock XYZ continued its run today with another large gain."</p>
