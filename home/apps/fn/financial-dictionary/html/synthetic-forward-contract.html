<h1>Synthetic Forward Contract</h1>

<p>A position in which the investor is long a call option and short a put option. The synthetic forward contract requires that both options be held simultaneously by a single investor, that have the same strike price and expiration date. This investment strategy mimics a regular forward contract, and is also called a synthetic futures contract. The investor will typically pay a net option premium when executing a synthetic forward contract, but part of the long position cost is offset by the short position.</p>

<p>Synthetic forwards can help investors reduce their risk, although as with trading futures outright, investors still face the possibility of significant losses if they don't implement proper risk-management strategies. a major advantage of synthetic forwards is that a "forward" position can be maintained without the same types of requirements for counterparties. Some types of synthetic forward contracts include trigger forward contracts and at-maturity trigger forward contracts.</p>
