<h1>Free and Clear</h1>

<p>A slang phrase describing the situation of someone when he or she gains outright ownership of an asset, such as when it is completely paid off and no creditor has a claim on the property.
The phrase is probably most commonly used in reference to one's mortgage. If your house is completely paid off, you own your house "free and clear."</p>

<p>In the case of real estate, before a sale can occur, the property must be "free and clear" so the buyers know that there are no prior claims on it.           </p>
