<h1>Business To Government - B To G</h1>

<p>Professional affairs conducted between companies and regional, municipal or federal governing bodies. Business to government typically encompasses the determination and evaluation of government agency needs, the creation and submission of proposals and the completion of the contracted work.</p>

<p>An example of a business to government company is a firm that offers IT consulting services to a government agency. The government uses the B2G arrangement in order to keep its technology up to date and in working condition, while at the same time limiting expenses by not taking on full-time staff who would require benefits.</p>
