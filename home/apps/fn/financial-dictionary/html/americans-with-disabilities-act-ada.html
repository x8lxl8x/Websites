<h1>Americans With Disabilities Act - ADA</h1>

<p>Legislation passed in 1990 that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. Under this Act, discrimination against a disabled person is illegal in employment, transportation, public accommodations, communications and government activities. The law prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against the disabled. Employers are required to make reasonable accommodations in order for the disabled person to perform their job function.</p>

<p>Under this law, an employer is not required to make reasonable accommodations if it presents undue hardship to the business and requires significant expenses in comparison to the size of the company. Some examples of accommodations include supplying a deaf applicant with a sign language interpreter during a job interview, modifying a work schedule to meet the needs of a person who needs treatment or restructuring an existing facility to make it readily accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>
