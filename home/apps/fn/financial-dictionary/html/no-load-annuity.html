<h1>No-Load Annuity</h1>

<p>A type of variable annuity that charges much lower fees and expenses than traditional annuity contracts. No-load annuities are seldom if ever sold by brokers or commission-based planners because they do not pay a commission to the salesperson. These contracts usually have little or no back-end surrender charge associated with them.</p>

<p>No-load annuities are generally marketed directly by the issuing insurance company or through fee-based financial advisors. Investors who purchase these contracts directly from a carrier can generally expect a fairly low level of customer service. For this reason, they are probably most appropriate for experienced investors who understand the characteristics and use of annuities, and can allocate their assets among the subaccounts themselves.</p>
