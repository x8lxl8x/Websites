<h1>Paris Hilton Stock Index</h1>

<p>A stock index comprised of companies associated with the socialite Paris Hilton. Some investors conceive her influence on the consumer spending habits of her fans is material enough to give these companies a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>The concept behind the Paris Hilton Index resides in her endorsements and product lines. Ideally, Hilton's fans see her using certain products or releasing her own brands and flock to purchase the goods. As a result, the companies behind the products experience increased sales. Companies included in this index are Parlux Fragrances (who manufacture Hilton's brand of perfumes), News Corp, Time Warner and Amazon.</p>
