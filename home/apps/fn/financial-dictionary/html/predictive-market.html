<h1>Predictive Market </h1>

<p>A speculative market that is based on speculations regarding events, such as who will win an election or whether a sports player will be resigned to a team. All of the "trades" involve a prediction with an unambiguous outcome.</p>

<p>Many predictive markets are available to the public, and encompass predictions from who will win an Oscar, to trends in the video gaming industry. A predictive market is structured as a betting exchange, and participants bet (trade) on how they expect an event to unfold.</p>
