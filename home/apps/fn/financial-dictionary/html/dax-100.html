<h1>Deutscher Aktienindex 100 - DAX 100</h1>

<p>A former price-weighted index that represented Germany's top traded 100 stocks. DAX is an abbreviation for Deutscher Aktienindex. The DAX 100 was formed using the 30 DAX equities and the 70 MDAX equities listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Since March 24, 2003, the MDAX has included 50 equities and the former DAX 100 switched to the HDAX. The HDAX index reflects the price development of all shares in the DAX 30 (commonly referred to as the DAX), MDAX and TecDAX.</p>

<p>The HDAX represents a broader blue chip index when compared to the DAX, and covers all the sectors that are listed in the EU regulated markets Prime Standard Segment. The DAX 30, MDAX and TecDAX are aggregated to form the HDAX. The DAX 30 reflects the 30 largest and most actively traded companies listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange; the MDAX is comprised of 50 mid-cap issues from traditional sectors; and the TecDAX tracks the 30 largest and most liquid issues from the technology sectors.</p>
