<h1>Cash Management</h1>

<p>The corporate process of collecting, managing and (short-term) investing cash. A key component of ensuring a company's financial stability and solvency. Frequently corporate treasurers or a business manager is responsible for overall cash management.</p>

<p>Successful cash management involves not only avoiding insolvency (and therefore bankruptcy), but also reducing days in account receivables (AR), increasing collection rates, selecting appropriate short-term investment vehicles, and increasing days cash on hand all in order to improve a company's overall financial profitability.</p>

<p>Successfully managing cash is an essential skill for small business developers because they typically have less access to affordable credit and have a significant amount of upfront costs they need to manage while waiting for receivables. Wisely managing cash enables a company to meet unexpected expenses in addition to handling regularly-occurring events like payroll.</p>
