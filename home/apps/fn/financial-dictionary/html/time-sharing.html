<h1>Time Sharing</h1>

<p>A hybrid form of ownership. A time share is the right to occupy a unit of real estate property, such as a condominium or vacation home, during a specified number of separate time periods. Each time period is for a certain duration, such as one or two weeks. Time-sharing allows multiple purchasers to buy interests in the same real estate.</p>

<p>Time-sharing is a popular form of real estate ownership where a single property is jointly owned by individuals who agree to use the property at different times. Frequently, time-sharing occurs at resorts or in popular vacation destinations, such as ocean-front properties, where the outright cost of ownership would be cost-prohibitive.</p>
