<h1>RHS Loan</h1>

<p>A loan made by or guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service (RHS). The RHS lends both directly to low income borrowers in rural areas and guarantees loans that meet RHS requirements made by approved lenders. RHS mortgage loans may be part of a pool of mortgages securitized by the Government Nation Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).</p>

<p>The RHS originates and guarantees more than home mortgages. The RHS operates loan programs for community services such as health care clinics, police and fire stations, schools, and childcare centers.</p>
