<h1>Capital Stock Insurance Companies</h1>

<p>A capital stock insurance company is a company that gets its capital from contributions from its stockholders in addition to its surplus accounts and reserve accounts. In other words, a capital stock insurance company is one that gets a majority of its assets or money from the sale of shares or stock to stockholders.</p>

<p>In addition to issuing shares or stocks, insurance companies get their wealth from their surplus and reserve accounts. Reserve accounts are funds set aside by insurance company, at the beginning of a year to meet costs of old and new claims that have been filed. It is important to note that only publicly-traded insurance companies can be capital stock insurance companies.</p>
