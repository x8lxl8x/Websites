<h1>Stretch Annuity</h1>

<p>An annuity option where tax-deferred allowances are passed on to the beneficiaries, offering the beneficiaries more flexibility and control over maintaining the investment. Therefore, the beneficiary has less restraints on wealth transfer, and he or she is able to receive a larger sum of benefits stretched over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>Legacy annuities or stretch annuities are not offered by many insurers, unfortunately. This type of annuity is very advantageous because the beneficiary isn't burdened with paying a huge tax bill on his or her gains. This often can be stressful for a family that has just dealt with the loss of a loved one.</p>
