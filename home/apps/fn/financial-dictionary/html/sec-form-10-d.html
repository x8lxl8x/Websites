<h1>SEC Form 10-D</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Asset-Backed Issuer Distribution Report. It is used by certain asset-backed security issuers to notify regulators and investors of interest, dividend, and capital distributions. This form contains the supporting details surrounding previous or upcoming distributions from asset-backed securities. Information included on this form will include the total value of the distribution, timing of the distribution, and liquidation of the investments underlying an issue or a tranche.</p>

<p>SEC Form 10-D has become one of the most crucial forms for bond investors, regulators, and government officials to examine in light of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. This form helps all interested parties to understand the exact nature of distributions being made by asset-backed bonds such as mortgage securities or corporate bonds.</p>
