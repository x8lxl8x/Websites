<h1>Capital Markets</h1>

<p>A market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities. Organizations/institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds. Thus, this type of market is composed of both the primary and secondary markets.</p>

<p>Both the stock and bond markets are parts of the capital markets. For example, when a company conducts an IPO, it is tapping the investing public for capital and is therefore using the capital markets. This is also true when a country's government issues Treasury bonds in the bond market to fund its spending initiatives.</p>
