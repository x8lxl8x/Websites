<p>A bank was established in 1991 to aide ex-Soviet and Eastern European countries transitioning into democracies by developing free market economies. Today, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developement (EBRD) continues its work in 27 countries from central Europe to central Asia, investing mainly in private banks and businesses including both new ventures and existing companies.</p>
