<h1>Three White Soldiers</h1>

<p>A bullish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the reversal of the current downtrend. This pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that have closed higher than the previous day, with each session's open occurring within the body of the previous candle.</p>

<p>These long-bodied candlesticks are a sign of the change in investor sentiment and are used by traders to confirm a shift in momentum. This pattern may form after a period of consolidation, which is still a valid sign of a move higher, but it is not as desirable as it would be if it were found at the end of a prolonged downtrend.</p>
