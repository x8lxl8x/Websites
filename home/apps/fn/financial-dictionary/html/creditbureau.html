<h1>Credit Bureau</h1>

<p>An agency that researches and collects individual credit information and sells it for a fee to creditors so they can make a decision on granting loans. Typical clients include banks, mortgage lenders, credit card companies and other financing companies. Also commonly referred to as consumer reporting agency or credit reporting agency.</p>

<p>A credit bureau doesn't decide whether an individual qualifies for credit or not.  It only collects information that it considers relevant to a person's credit history and habits.
The three main credit bureaus in the United States are Equifax, Experian and Trans Union.</p>
