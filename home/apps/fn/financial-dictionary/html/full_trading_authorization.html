<h1>Full Trading Authorization</h1>

<p>A level of trading authorization that grants an agent or broker the power to place orders, withdraw funds or make inquiries concerning a client's account. Written documentation must be completed by the client before an agent or broker can be given power of attorney over the client's account.</p>

<p>Full trading authorization allows brokers to buy or sell securities on behalf of their clients, look into account activity or overall balances and extract funds for dispersement. This level of authorization is often used by investors who may not have sufficient knowledge to engage in trading.</p>

<p>Investors who do not want to allow a broker to transfer funds from their accounts may consider limited trading authorization. This limits the broker's approved actions to purchasing and selling securities or account inquiries, and restricts them from accessing funds.</p>
