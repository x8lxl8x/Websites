<h1>Reconversion</h1>

<p>A method used by individuals to minimize the tax burden of converting an IRA by recharacterizing Roth IRA-converted amounts back to a Traditional IRA and then converting these assets back to a Roth IRA again. Be aware that the IRS released regulations in 1999 placing limits on reconversions.</p>

<p>Investors who want to reconvert to a Roth IRA must wait until the beginning of the new tax year following the tax year they recharacterized or a minimum of 30 days after the recharacterization is completed, whichever is later. For example, if you recharacterized a conversion contribution on December 15, 209, you would not be able to reconvert until January 15, 2010. If you reconvert prior to these limits, the reconversion will be deemed a failed conversion by the IRS, and if not corrected may result in an excess contribution to the Roth IRA.</p>
