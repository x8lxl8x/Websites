<h1>Scrambled Assortment</h1>

<p>A merchandise assortment strategy in which a company carries products that are unrelated to its primary line of business in order to attract additional customers. A scrambled assortment may involve carrying products that are the same type, such as a book store also carrying journals and stationery, or it may involve carrying an unrelated type of product, such as a company operating several business newspapers also printing a newspaper devoted to sports.</p>

<p>The goal of a scrambled assortment is to cast a wider net to catch customers who may also become interested in the company's primary line of products. For example, a financial newspaper printer may develop a sports magazine to attract a larger male audience, who in turn might be interested in learning more about investments. Also, through advertising placements in the sports magazine, the company may drive subscriptions to its other products.</p>
