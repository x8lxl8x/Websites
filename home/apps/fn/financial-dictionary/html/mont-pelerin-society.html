<h1>Mont Pelerin Society</h1>

<p>A group of economically and politically liberal economists, philosophers and historians. The Mont Pelerin Society addressed concerns about the future and fate of modern liberalism. It primarily functions as a platform for the exchange of political and economic ideas.</p>

<p>The MPS was created in 1947 in response to the perceived decline in the values of western civilization. Its members have included Nobel Prize winners, top economists and financiers, and many other powerful intellectual figures. However, the group has not aligned itself with any political party.</p>
