<h1>Maintenance Expenses</h1>

<p>The costs incurred to keep an item in good condition and/or good working order. When purchasing an item that requires upkeep, consumers should consider not just the initial price tag, but also the item's ongoing maintenance expenses. Maintenance expenses are a major reason why home ownership can be more expensive than renting, for example. However, sometimes even items that are merely leased, not owned, such as a leased car, will require the owner to pay maintenance expenses.</p>

<p>Examples of maintenance expenses for automobiles include gas, oil changes, alignment, tire replacement, brake fluid and car washes. Maintenance expenses for a house include lawn care, plumbing repairs, roof repairs, hazard insurance premiums and replacement of worn out appliances.</p>
