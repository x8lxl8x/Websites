<h1>Corporate Finance</h1>

<p>1) The financial activities related to running a corporation.</p>

<p>2) A division or department that oversees the financial activities of a company. Corporate finance is primarily concerned with maximizing shareholder value through long-term and short-term financial planning and the implementation of various strategies. Everything from capital investment decisions to investment banking falls under the domain of corporate finance.</p>

<p>Among the financial activities that a corporate finance department is involved with are capital investment decisions. Should a proposed investment be made? How should the company pay for it; with equity or with debt, or combination of both? Should shareholders be offered dividends on their investment in the company? These are just some of the questions a corporate financial officer attempts to answer on a consistent basis. Short-term issues include the management of current assets and current liabilities, inventory control, investments and other short-term financial issues. Long-term issues include new capital purchases and investments.</p>
