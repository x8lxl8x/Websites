<h1>Trading Dollars</h1>

<p>A slang term describing a company that is spending just as much money as it is making on a product that it develops. Trading dollars refers to a breakeven business investment. The company essential trades its expenses for an equal amount of return, thus the name "trading dollars," or "trading dollars for dollars."</p>

<p>Since businesses are interested in generating profits, trading dollars is a situation that typically describes a waste of effort and resources. While the venture did not lose money, the capital could have been allocated to a profitable venture. In this sense, any event that results in trading dollars can be viewed as a loss rather than just a break-even event.</p>

<p>For example, a gold exploration company that spends $10 million to mine $10 million worth of gold can be said to be trading dollars. Likewise, an oil company that invests $5 million to extract only $5 million worth of oil is trading dollars. These business ventures are zero-sum games, where the business's gains are exactly balanced by its losses (or expenses) in product development or in a particular business investment.</p>
