<h1>Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) .BO</h1>

<p>The first and largest securities market in India, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) was established in 1875 as the Native Share and Stock Brokers' Association. Based in Mumbai, India, the BSE lists over 6,000 companies and is one of the largest exchanges in the world. The BSE has helped develop the country's capital markets, including the retail debt market, and helped grow the Indian corporate sector.</p>

<p>In 1995 the BSE switched from an open-floor to an electronic trading system. Securities listed by the BSE include stocks, stock futures, stock options, index futures, index options and weekly options. The BSE's overall performance is measured by the Sensex, an index of 30 of the BSE's largest stocks covering 12 sectors.</p>
