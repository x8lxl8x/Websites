<h1>Bird In Hand</h1>

<p>A theory that postulates that investors prefer dividends from a stock to potential capital gains because of the inherent uncertainty of the latter. Based on the adage that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, the bird-in-hand theory states that investors prefer the certainty of dividend payments to the possibility of substantially higher future capital gains.</p>

<p>The theory was developed by Myron Gordon and John Lintner as a counterpoint to the Modigliani-Miller dividend irrelevance theory, which maintains that investors are indifferent to whether their returns from holding a stock arise from dividends or capital gains. Under the bird-in-hand theory, stocks with high dividend payouts are sought by investors and consequently command a higher market price.</p>
