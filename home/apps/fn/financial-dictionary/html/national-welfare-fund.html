<h1>National Welfare Fund (Russia)</h1>

<p>One of two parts of the Russian sovereign wealth fund, the other being the Reserve Fund. The National Welfare Fund invests its funds abroad to counteract inflation in the Russian ruble. Combined, the Reserve Fund and National Welfare Fund make up one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the country.</p>

<p>The National Welfare Fund originated from the Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation, which was established to help balance the Russian government's fiscal budget. In 2008, the fund was split into a Reserve Fund and the National Welfare Fund. The Reserve Fund is invested in conservative foreign investments and is used as a stabilization fund to balance the federal budget. The National Welfare Fund is invested more aggressively.</p>
