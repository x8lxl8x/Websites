<h1>Gross Earnings</h1>

<p>1. For individuals, the total income earned in a year, as calculated prior to any tax deductions or adjustments.</p>

<p>2. For public companies, gross earnings is an accounting convention, referring to the amount of initial profit left over from total revenues for a specified time period, once cost of goods sold have been deducted.</p>

<p>1. For example, consider John who earned a total of $50,000 for the recently completed fiscal year, and made $5,000 of contributions to a government-sponsored savings plan. Because his contributions reduce his taxable earnings, John is allowed to base his tax calculations off taxable earnings of $45,000, while his actual gross earnings for the year are $50,000.</p>

<p>2. A company's gross earnings are reported periodically on its income statement. The first line of the income statement reports a company's total sales for a given time period. When cost of goods sold (COGS) is subtracted from this number, the remaining difference is referred to as the company's gross earnings.</p>
