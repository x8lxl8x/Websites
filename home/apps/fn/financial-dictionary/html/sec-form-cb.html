<h1>SEC Form CB</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required when engaged in specified tender offers, rights offerings or business combinations with a foreign private issuer with less than 10% of its securities held by U.S. persons.</p>

<p>SEC Form CB is used to report cross-border transactions and must be filed by both foreign and domestic persons engaged in the transaction.</p>

<p>Form CB, which is also known as the Tender Offer/Rights Offering Notification Form, is a requirement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.</p>

<p>This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
