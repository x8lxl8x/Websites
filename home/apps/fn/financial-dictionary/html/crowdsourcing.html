<h1>Crowdsourcing</h1>

<p>A method of acquiring news about current events. Crowdsourcing gleans information about breaking events from the general public, as opposed to waiting for a professional news organization to relay a report. Video clips that are posted online are often used in crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>The internet is often the chief tool used in crowdsourcing. Websites and blogs are important sources of independent information for many, and have supplanted other traditional methods of gaining public sentiment on an issue. Crowdsourcing may effectively serve to undermine the bias that many accuse professional newsmakers of harboring, in some instances.</p>
