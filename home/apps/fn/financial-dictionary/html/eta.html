<h1>Employment And Training Administration - ETA</h1>

<p>A federal agency that operates under the U.S. Department of Labor. The agency's responsibilities include monitoring and administering information to the U.S. labor market. It is focused on employee development and training, increasing employment opportunities and helping manage local and state unemployment insurance.</p>

<p>The ETA is by far the most important agency in helping individuals find and retain meaningful work in the United States. Currently, the system is focused on providing employment for the country's highest growing and newest industries. Such a system requires a large investment in education and training for individuals just out of high school. Subsequently, for 2006 the agency was appropriated a budget of $10.63 billion to implement this system and other initiatives.</p>
