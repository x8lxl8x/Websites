<h1>Giffen Good</h1>

<p>A consumer good for which demand rises when the price increases, and demand falls when the price decreases. This phenomenon is notable because it violates the law of demand, whereby demand should increase as price falls and decrease as price rises. To be a Giffen good, the item must lack easy subsitutes and it must be an inferior good, or a good for which demand declines as the level of income in the economy increases. Economists disagree on whether Giffen goods exist and how common they are.</p>

<p>The other type of consumer good that violates the law of demand is a Veblen good. Demand for Veblen goods increases as their prices increase because people perceive them to be of higher quality. A designer handbag would be an example of a Veblen good.</p>
