<h1>Net Borrowed Reserves</h1>

<p>A statistic released in weekly Federal Reserve data showing the difference between the amount of money a bank has borrowed from the Fed and the cash reserves the bank holds above the required minimum. Net borrowed reserves is expressed as a negative number. Deposit banks are required to keep a certain amount of cash on hand at all times. If these banks don't have enough cash, they will borrow it from a Federal Reserve bank.</p>

<p>Net borrowed reserves can indicate a tight credit environment relative to the demand for loans and rising interest rates.</p>

<p>Conversely, if there is an excess of reserves in the banking system, the statistic will show net free reserves, which will be expressed as a positive number.</p>
