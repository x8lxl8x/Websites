<h1>SEC Form U-7D</h1>

<p>A certificate that summarizes the leasing arrangements of any kind of utility facility by a prospective utility holding company. The SEC Form U-7D contains a breakdown of the cost of the facility, as well as financing terms and a description of the facility itself. The term of the lease must also be included, and estimations or substitutions can be made if definitive information is not yet available.</p>

<p>Form U-7D is required by rule 7(d) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. It must be submitted in triplicate within 30 days of the lease being granted. Holding companies that do not do so are in violation of the act.</p>
