<h1>Incorporeal Rights</h1>

<p>Rights that can't be seen or touched, but are still enforceable by law. Generally incorporeal rights have to do with intangible property such as copyrights, licenses and easements. Unlike real property that can be physically quantified, intangible property is conceptual in nature. However, the rights associated with intangible property the incorporeal rights are just as valid as the rights associated with real property.</p>

<p>Just like other rights, incorporeal rights are transferable and inheritable. Intangible property can be sold, traded, willed or given. The rights associated with the intangible property will transfer along with the property.</p>
