<h1>Market</h1>

<p>1. A medium that allows buyers and sellers of a specific good or service to interact in order to facilitate an exchange. The price that individuals pay during the transaction may be determined by a number of factors, but price is often determined by the forces of supply and demand.</p>

<p>2. The general market where securities are traded.</p>

<p>3. People with the desire and ability to buy a specific product/service.</p>

<p>1. Markets do not necessarily need to be a physical meeting place. Internet-based stores and auction sites are all markets in which transactions can take place entirely online and where the two parties do not ever need to physically meet.</p>

<p>2. If a broad market index (such as the S&P 500) fell, people might say that "the market was down," using the S&P 500 as a proxy to represent the overall market's performance.</p>

<p>3. For example, "the widget market" is referring to all the people who will buy widgets.</p>
