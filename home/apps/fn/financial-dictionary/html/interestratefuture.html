<h1>Interest Rate Future</h1>

<p>A futures contract with an underlying instrument that pays interest. An interest rate future is a contract between the buyer and seller agreeing to the future delivery of any interest-bearing asset. The interest rate future allows the buyer and seller to lock in the price of the interest-bearing asset for a future date.</p>

<p>Interest rate futures can be based on underlying instruments such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Treasury Bills in the case of Treasury Bill Futures traded on the CME</li>
<li>Treasury Bonds  in the case of Treasury Bond Futures traded on the CBT</li>
<li>Other products such as CDs, Treasury Notes and Ginnie Mae's are also available to trade as underlying assets in an interest rate future</li>
</ul>

<p>Because interest rate futures contracts are large in size (i.e. $1 million for Treasury Bills), they are not a product for the less sophisticated trader.</p>
