<h1>Combination Agency</h1>

<p>A type of agency which combines segments that are normally separate. A combination agency will take two separate but related services and provide them both to customers. In life insurance, a combination agency could sell both ordinary life insurance as well as industrial life coverage, or it could provide both life insurance and health insurance. These agencies stand in contrast to those that focus on only one type of service. Also known as combination companies.</p>

<p>Many life insurance agencies are combination agencies. The agency may have separate agents or brokers that focus on one type of coverage or the other, or they may all sell both lines. Companies will do this when they feel the services provided are close enough that customers will benefit from a one-stop shop. Also, combination companies can increase their revenue by offering both lines of coverage. Some regulations prevent certain companies from providing two related services, for example some financial institutions might not be able to provide banking services and life insurance in the same branch. Instead, customers might be directed to call for the service.</p>

<p>Fire departments refer to combination agencies as departments with both volunteer and paid employees.</p>
