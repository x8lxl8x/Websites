<h1>Preferred Dividend Coverage Ratio</h1>

<p>A coverage ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off its required preferred dividend payments. A healthy company will have a high coverage ratio, indicating that it has little difficulty in paying off its preferred dividend requirements.</p>

<p>Formula:

</p>

<p>Not only does this ratio give investors an idea of a company's ability to pay off its preferred dividend requirements, but it also gives common shareholders an idea of how likely they are to be paid dividends. If the company has a hard time covering its preferred dividend requirements, common shareholders are less likely to receive a dividend payment on their holdings.</p>
