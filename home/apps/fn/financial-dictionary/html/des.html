<h1>Delivered Ex Ship - DES</h1>

<p>A trade term requiring the seller to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed port of arrival. The seller remains responsible for the goods until they are delivered.</p>

<p>Contracts involving international transportation often contain abbreviated trade terms that describe matters. It includes details like the time and place of delivery, payment when the risk of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer, and who pays the costs of freight and insurance.</p>

<p>The most commonly known trade terms are Incoterms. They are published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Incoterms are often identical in form to domestic terms (such as the American Uniform Commercial Code), but have different meanings. As a result, parties to a contract must expressly indicate the governing law of their terms.</p>

<p>It's important to realize that because this is a legal term, its exact definition is much more complicated and differs by country. It is suggested that you contact an international trade lawyer before using any trade term.</p>
