<h1>Micro Accounting</h1>

<p>Accounting at a personal, corporate or government level. Micro accounting can also refer to accounting at the individual or subunit component level of an enterprise or entity. It is diametrically opposed to macro accounting, which is concerned with accounting at the aggregate or national level.</p>

<p>As conventional accounting is more like micro accounting than macro accounting (which is closer to economics), most accounting professionals are employed in micro accounting. As a result, the number of accounting positions at the individual enterprise level also vastly outnumbers those at the macro level.</p>
