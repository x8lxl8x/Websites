<h1>Earnings Estimate</h1>

<p>An analyst's estimate for a company's future quarterly or annual earnings. Future earnings estimates are arguably the most important input when attempting to value a firm. By placing estimates on the earnings of a firm for certain periods (quarterly, annually, etc), analysts can then use cashflow analysis to approximate a fair value for a company, which in turn will give a target share price for publicly traded companies.</p>

<p>Analysts use forecasting models, management guidance and fundamental information on the company in order to derive an estimate. Market participants rely heavily on earnings estimates to gauge a company's performance when announcing quarterly or annual results. The analysts' earnings estimates are used as a benchmark to measure a firm's performance relative to how experts expected it would do.</p>
