<h1>Equity Takeout</h1>

<p>Taking money out of a property to use for a variety of purposes. Equity takeout allows homeowners to tap into the equity of their home. When an equity takeout is done on your home, the principal on the value of the mortgage will increase, if there is an existing mortgage on the property. If you don't have a mortgage, you are borrowing against the property.</p>

<p>This mortgage is available in two forms: the traditional fixed rate mortgage or a variable line of credit option. The main difference between the fixed and variable types is that the traditional fixed provides stable interest rates for a predetermined period of time and has limited prepayment options. The variable line has a fluctuating interest rate and flexible prepayment options. A equity takeout is also referred to as an equity takeout mortgage.</p>

<p>Homeowners take money out of their property for different reasons including investment in other real estate properties, stocks or equities, and purchase of properties that are considered recreational such as cottage or vacation homes. Other purposes include using the money to cover tuition fees, home renovations or startup business costs.</p>
