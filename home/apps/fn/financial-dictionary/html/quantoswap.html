<h1>Quanto Swap</h1>

<p>A swap with varying combinations of interest rate, currency and equity swap features, where payments are based on the movement of two different countries' interest rates.</p>

<p>This is also referred to as a differential or "diff" swap.</p>

<p>Though they deal with two different currencies, payments are settled in the same currency. For example, a typical quanto swap would involve a U.S. investor paying six-month LIBOR in U.S. dollars (for a US$1 million loan), and receive payments in U.S. dollars at the six-month EURIBOR + 75 basis points.</p>

<p>Fixed-for-floating quanto swaps allow an investor to minimize foreign exchange risk. This is achieved by fixing both the exchange rate and interest rate at the same time. Floating-for-floating swaps have slightly higher risk, since each party is exposed to the spread between each country's currency interest rate.</p>
