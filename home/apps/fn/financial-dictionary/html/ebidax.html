<h1>Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, Amortization and Exploration - EBIDAX</h1>

<p>An earnings metric used in the evaluation of oil, gas and mineral firms. The metric is used in a similar manner to the way that EBITDA is used for other firms, and allows investors and other stakeholders to get a better idea of the true earnings-generating capacity of the firm without the obscuring the effects of accounting rules.</p>

<p>EBIDAX is one of several earnings metrics that may be employed by analysts to evaluate the financial strength of an oil, gas or mineral firm. Exploration costs are excluded because there are different methods than can be used to account for exploration costs in oil and gas accounting. Excluding these costs allows for a more accurate comparison to the firm's competitors, who may use different accounting methods.</p>
