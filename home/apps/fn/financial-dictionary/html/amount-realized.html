<h1>Amount Realized</h1>

<p>The gain or loss resulting from a sale of an asset. The amount realized encompasses all forms of compensation, including cash, the value of any property received as payment and any liabilities that the purchaser assumes as a result of the transaction.</p>

<p>The amount realized does not include transaction costs such as commissions and other related fees.</p>

<p>To calculate the amount realized, simply take the difference of the total consideration given and subtract the cost basis. If the difference is positive, then the amount realized is a gain. If the difference is negative, the amount realized is a loss.</p>

<p>The total consideration will also include any liabilities assumed, as in this example:</p>

<p>Assume you have sold some property that has an outstanding mortgage of $75,000 to a buyer. The buyer pays you $40,000 and assumes the mortgage. In this case, you would have realized a total gain of $115,000 ($40,000 payment + $75,000 mortgage transferred).</p>
