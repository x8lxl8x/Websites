<h1>Term Structure Of Interest Rates</h1>

<p>The relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities. The term structure of interest rates is also known as a yield curve and it plays a central role in an economy. The term structure reflects expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions.</p>

<p>In general terms, yields increase in line with maturity, giving rise to an upward sloping yield curve or a "normal yield curve." One basic explanation for this phenomenon is that lenders demand higher interest rates for longer-term loans as compensation for the greater risk associated with them, in comparison to short-term loans. Occasionally, long-term yields may fall below short-term yields, creating an "inverted yield curve" that is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession.</p>
