<h1>SEC Form 10-K405</h1>

<p>A form used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to 2003. SEC Form 10-K405 was used to indicate that an officer or director of a company failed to file a Form 4 (or similar Form 3 or Form 5) on time, meaning that they did not disclose their insider trading activities within the required time frame.</p>

<p>Guidelines for reporting insider trading activity is covered under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act. Form 10-K405 was eliminated after it was determined that the use of the form by companies was inconsistent and unreliable. The form is no longer accepted by the EDGAR system.</p>
