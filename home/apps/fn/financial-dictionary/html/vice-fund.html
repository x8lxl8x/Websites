<h1>Vice Fund</h1>

<p>A mutual fund that invests in gaming, such as casino operators and gaming equipment, alcohol, tobacco and aerospace/defense sectors. The fund invests in both domestic and foreign-based equities, and holdings range from small cap to mega cap companies.</p>

<p>The fund has been in operation since 2002 and focuses on so-called "vices" that are considered by many to be socially irresponsible investments, or "sin stocks".</p>

<p>The Vice Fund has little direct competition based on sector allocations, but as of 2007, it had outperformed the Russell 1000 Index (its benchmark index) since its inception. The fund is considered non-diversified, and carries a relatively high expense ratio of greater than 1.5% annually.</p>

<p>The Vice Fund stands in stark contrast to the many socially conscious or responsible mutual funds on the market, but it is based on the philosophy that sectors like gaming and alcohol have inherently solid demand; therefore, companies that are leaders in these sectors should produce good returns for shareholders.</p>
