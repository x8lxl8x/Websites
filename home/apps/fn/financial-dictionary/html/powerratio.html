<h1>Power Ratio</h1>

<p>A measure of a media company's revenue performance (i.e., advertising income) in comparison to the audience share it controls, calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Company Revenue / (Audience Share * Total Market Revenue)</p>

<p>The power ratio shows how much revenue a media company earns compared to how much it would be expected to earn given its market share. Companies want to have a power ratio of at least 1.0, which indicates expected revenue levels, but a higher power ratio is better because it indicates a greater amount of revenue received from the company's audience share. Power ratios show how well a media company converts ratings to revenue.</p>

<p>Power ratios help media firms evaluate their own performance and, in the case of a possible acquisition, evaluate the performance of a target media company. Power ratios can also be used to compare the revenue performance of one category of media (e.g., the Internet) to another category (e.g., newspapers).</p>

<p>An academic study of power ratios published in the <i>Journal of Media Business Studies</i> in 2005 found that as a radio station's audience share grows, its market revenue share grows disproportionately and as its audience share shrinks, its market revenue share decreases disproportionately.</p>
