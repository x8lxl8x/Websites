<h1>SEC Form PRES14C</h1>

<p>A now-obsolete filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had to be filed by a registrant to notify its shareholders when a special meeting was going to be held. SEC Form PRES14C applied to security holders who were entitled to vote on issues for which the company was not soliciting proxies. It provided security holders with information required by Schedule 14A as well as information about whether certain persons, such as directors, officers and associates, had an interest in corporate matters that differed from the interest of general shareholders, or intended to oppose action to be taken by the corporation. The form was required to state that proxies were not being solicited.</p>

<p>Form PRES14C, "preliminary information statements: preliminary special meeting",  was required under Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form was used to help the SEC protect shareholders' rights by ensuring that they received key information, clearly presented. It was eliminated with EDGAR Release 8.2. Form PRE 14A is now used in its place.</p>
