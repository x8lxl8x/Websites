<h1>529 Plan</h1>

<p>A plan that allows for the prepayment of qualified higher education expenses at eligible educational institutions.</p>

<p>Also known as a "qualified tuition program," or more fully as a "section 529 plan."</p>

<p>The prepayment may be in the form of a contribution to an account established specifically for paying higher educational expenses. There is no income restriction for individuals who want to contribute to a 529 plan; however, because contributions cannot exceed the amount that sufficiently covers the expenses of the beneficiary's qualified higher education, individuals should take care not to over-fund the 529 plan.</p>
