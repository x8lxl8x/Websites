<h1>All-Ordinaries Stock Index</h1>

<p>A stock index comprised of common shares from the Australian Stock Exchange. The All-Ordinaries Index is the most quoted benchmark for Australian equities. The ASX is responsible for calculating and distributing the index and its returns.</p>

<p>The All-Ordinaries Index is market weighted and includes over 300 companies. For a company to be included in the index, they must meet the requirements established by the ASX. For example, a stock must have a market value of over 0.2% of all equities listed on the exchange. Furthermore, the stock must be liquid, with a monthly turnover of 0.5% of its total outstanding shares. The ASX rebalances the index each month, ensuring companies still meet these requirements.</p>
