<h1>Internationalization</h1>

<p>The designing of a product in such a way that it will meet the needs of users in many countries or can be easily adapted to do so. Internationalization might mean designing a website so that when it is translated from English to Spanish the layout still works - many words in Spanish have more characters and therefore take up more space on the page in Spanish than in English.</p>

<p>Products that are internationalized often must be localized to fit the needs of that country's users. For example, an internationalized software program would need to be localized to display the date as November 14 for use in the United States and as 14 November for use in England.</p>

<p>Internationalization can also refer to the design of an educational curriculum that will enable students to thrive in foreign countries and in their interactions with other cultures.</p>
