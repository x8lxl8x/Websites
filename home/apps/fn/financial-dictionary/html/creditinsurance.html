<h1>Credit Insurance</h1>

<p>Credit insurance is a type of life insurance policy purchased by a borrower that pays off one or more existing debts in the event of a death, disability, or in rare cases, unemployment. Credit insurance is marketed most often as a credit card feature, with the monthly cost charging a low percentage of the card's unpaid balance.</p>

<p>Credit insurance can be a financial lifesaver in the event of certain catastrophes. However, many credit insurance policies are overpriced relative to their benefits, as well as loaded with fine print that can make it hard to collect on. If you feel that credit insurance would bring you peace of mind, be sure to read the fine print as well as compare your quote against a standard term life insurance policy.</p>
