<h1>Leo F. Mullin</h1>

<p>A former CEO and chairman of Delta Airlines. Born in 1943 in Massachusetts, Mullin earned his MBA from Harvard. He began his career with consulting firm McKinsey and eventually became the first outsider CEO of Delta in 1997 and chairman in 1999. He stepped down as CEO in 2003 and as chairman in 2004. He initially helped the company improve its finances, but later in his tenure, Delta struggled with rising labor and fuel costs, the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a controversy over executive pay and employee wage cuts and layoffs.</p>

<p>Founded in 1928, Delta has grown substantially over the years through numerous mergers and acquisitions. It is a major airline with destinations in more than 350 cities worldwide. Mullin is also known for his involvement with the Museum of Natural History and the Chicago Chamber of Commerce.</p>
