<h1>Concentration Bank</h1>

<p>A financial institution that is the primary bank of an organization, or the bank where the organization does most of its transactions. Several organizations use multiple banks, but generally deal significantly with one bank in particular, which is referred to as the concentration bank.</p>

<p>An example of a concentration bank can be a company which has multiple chain stores across the country and each store deposits its cash into local banks. The company can set it up so that these funds can be concentrated or deposited into one account, usually called a concentration account, at a concentration bank.</p>
