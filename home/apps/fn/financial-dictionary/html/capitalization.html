<h1>Capitalization</h1>

<p>1. In accounting, it is where costs to acquire an asset are included in the price of the asset.</p>

<p>2. The sum of a corporation's stock, long-term debt and retained earnings. Also known as "invested capital".</p>

<p>3. A company's outstanding shares multiplied by its share price, better known as "market capitalization".</p>

<p>1. For example, if a machine has a price of $1 million this value would be recorded in the assets, if there was also a $20,000 charge for shipping the machine then this cost would be capitalized and included in assets.</p>

<p>2. The capitalization of a firm can be overcapitalized and undercapitalized, both of which are potential negatives.</p>

<p>3. If a company has 1,000,000 shares and is currently trading at $10 a share, their market capitalization is $10,000,000.</p>
