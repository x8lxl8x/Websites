<h1>Noncredit Services</h1>

<p>Fee-based services that do not involve the extension of credit that a lending institution offers to correspondent banks or corporate customers. Non-interest income generated from noncredit services can be a significant source of revenue for banks and financial institutions. Examples of noncredit services include trust and investment-related revenues, global cash management, foreign currency exchange, etc.</p>

<p>Noncredit services enable a bank to grow revenues without putting its assets at risk. Increasingly high priority noncredit services for banks and financial institutions include global custody - safely processing shares for funds managers - and cash management - helping businesses maintain an appropriate corporate cash balances without jeopardizing their short-term liquidity.</p>
