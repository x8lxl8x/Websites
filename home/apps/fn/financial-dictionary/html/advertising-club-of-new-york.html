<h1>Advertising Club Of New York</h1>

<p>The main organization for communications professionals in New York. It offers its members a forum for career development, networking, exchanging of ideas and the recognition of excellence. The Advertising Club of New York traces its origins back to 1896, when a group of business people who called themselves the Sphinx Club met regularly to discuss the advertising business. It became the Advertising Men's League in 1906, and subsequently the Advertising Club of New York in 1915. Also known as the AD Club.</p>

<p>The Advertising Club of New York developed the first formal educational program about advertising in 1906, when it launched a series of talks at New York University. Another first to its credit is the "truth in advertising" practice, through the formation of the Advertising Vigilance Committee in 1911, which later became the Better Business Bureau.</p>
