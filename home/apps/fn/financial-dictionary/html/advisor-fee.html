<h1>Advisor Fee</h1>

<p>The fee that is paid to a financial advisor for recommending a load mutual fund based on the needs and time-frame of an investor. Fees differ according to the class of mutual fund shares, and are paid to the advisor for recommending a fund that suits an investor's time and goals. Depending on the share class, advisor's can either receive a one-time fee up-front or an annual fee as long as the investor holds the asset.</p>

<p>The fee that an investor pays on A shares is upfront, starting at around 4-5% and decreases as more is invested. An investor with a large amount to invest over the long-term would be best suited with A shares. An investor with the same time-frame, but less to invest might do better in B shares. C shares are best for those investing for the short-term. Note that 12b-1 fees, the fees paid to a mutual fund's management, are higher for B and C shares, and lower for A shares. When choosing a class of shares, an investor should consider first how long they can invest. The advisor will get paid either way for directing you into the investment.</p>

<p>Also, investors who already have a fund picked out should pick a no-load fund, sidestepping the extra fees. The load goes to pay for the advice of the advisor. If that advice is not needed, don't pay the price for it.</p>
