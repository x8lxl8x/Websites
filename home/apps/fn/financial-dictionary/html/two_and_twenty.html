<h1>Two And Twenty</h1>

<p>A type of compensation structure that hedge fund managers typically employ in which part of compensation is performance based. More specifically, this phrase refers to how hedge fund managers charge a flat 2% of total asset value as a management fee and an additional 20% of any profits earned.</p>

<p>Considering that some of the top performing hedge funds earn upwards of 50% returns per year and that a given manager can manage billions of dollars worth of assets, this type of fee structure can be very lucrative for managers who consistently earn high returns.</p>

<p>For example, the top earning hedge fund manager in 2006, James Simons, earned around $1.7 billion in earnings. This is quite a bit higher than the highest paid manager on Wall Street, who was paid a relatively "low"  $54 million during the same time period.</p>
