<h1>Slow Market</h1>

<p>1. A market that currently exhibits low trading volumes and/or low volatility levels. The term slow market can be used to describe a market with few issues coming up for sale to investors through initial public offerings and secondary offerings in the equity markets, or through new issuance in the corporate bond market.</p>

<p>2. A market in which trades are not executed at the fastest possible speed. Generally, a delay of more than a few seconds during the execution of a trade is considered slow, especially on the electronic trading exchanges.</p>

<p>1. Virtually any market will experience periods of low activity, ranging from a single day to months or longer. A slow market does not imply a rising or falling market, but it may imply a stationary or "hovering" market.</p>

<p>2. Regulation NMS was implemented to speed up situations in which slow markets exist by routing eligible orders to different exchanges for their immediate execution.</p>
