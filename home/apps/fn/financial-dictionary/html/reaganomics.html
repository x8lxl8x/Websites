<h1>Reaganomics</h1>

<p>A popular term used to refer to the economic policies of Ronald Reagan, the 40th U.S. President (1981-1989), which called for widespread tax cuts, decreased social spending, increased military spending, and the deregulation of domestic markets.</p>

<p>The term was used by supporters and detractors of Reagan's policies alike. Reaganomics was partially based on the principles of supply-side economics and the trickle-down theory. These theories hold the view that decreases in taxes, especially for corporations, is the best way to stimulate economic growth: the idea is that if the expenses of corporations are reduced, the savings will "trickle down" to the rest of the economy, spurring growth.</p>

<p>Prior to becoming Reagan's Vice President, George H. Bush coined the term "voodoo economics" as a proposed synonym for Reaganomics.</p>
