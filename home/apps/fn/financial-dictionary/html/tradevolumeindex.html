<h1>Trade Volume Index - TVI</h1>

<p>A technical indicator that measures the amount of money flowing in and out of an asset. Unlike many technical indicators, the TVI is generally created using intraday price data. The underlying assumption of this indicator is that there is buying pressure when the price trades near the asking price and selling pressure when it trades near the bid.
This indicator is very similar to the on-balance volume indicator except that it focuses on the volume attributed to every trade rather than the closing volume that is attributable to all trades. This indicator is primarily used by day traders to identify whether a security is being accumulated (bought) or distributed (sold).           </p>
