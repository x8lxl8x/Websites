<h1>Conditional Order</h1>

<p>A type of order that will be submitted or canceled if set criteria are met, which are defined by the trader/investor entering the order. This allows for a greater customization of the order to meet the specific needs of the investor.</p>

<p>For example, say an investor enters a limit order to buy shares at $45, but only once the shares have first reached $50 (confirming a breakout). The limit order at $45 will be submitted to the brokerage firm only once the shares have reached the $50 price. Conditional orders allow traders to enter into a trade without having to constantly monitor the market, allowing them to be as fast as the market.</p>
