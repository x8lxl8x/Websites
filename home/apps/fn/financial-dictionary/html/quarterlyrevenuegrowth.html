<h1>Quarterly Revenue Growth</h1>

<p>An increase of a company's sales when compared to a previous quarter's revenue performance. The current quarter's sales figure can be compared on a year-over-year basis or sequentially. This helps to give analysts, investors and participants an idea of how much a company's sales are increasing over time.</p>

<p>When looking at a company's quarterly or annual financials, it is not enough to just look at the revenue for the current period. When investing in a company, an investor wants to see it grow or improve over time. Looking at the financials in comparison to a previous quarter will give participants a much better idea of how well a company is doing.</p>

<p>For example, if Exxon Mobil generated $91.3 billion in revenue during its fourth quarter of 2005 and $82.2 billion in the third quarter that year, the company saw quarterly revenue growth of 11% sequentially. If Exxon Mobil generated $80.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, the company would have seen its revenue increase 13.8% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
