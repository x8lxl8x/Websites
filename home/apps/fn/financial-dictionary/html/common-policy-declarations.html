<h1>Common Policy Declarations</h1>

<p>The declarations that are located in a separate section of a property or casualty insurance policy. Common policy declarations contain all of the basic information that defines the policy. These declarations include the name of the insured, the amount of coverage and the name, description and location of the item or items being covered.</p>

<p>Common policy declarations are a basic part of every insurance contract. They also include the dates from which coverage begins and ends, as well as the amount of premium required. The premium that insurance companies charge is based on the information found in the declaration.</p>
