<h1>Insurance Claim</h1>

<p>A formal request to an insurance company asking for a payment based on the terms of the insurance policy. Insurance claims are reviewed by the company for their validity and then paid out to the insured or requesting party (on behalf of the insured) once approved.</p>

<p>Insurance claims cover everything from death benefits on life insurance policies to routine health exams at your local doctor. In many cases, claims are filed by third parties on behalf of the insured person, but usually only the person(s) listed on the policy is entitled to claims payment.</p>
