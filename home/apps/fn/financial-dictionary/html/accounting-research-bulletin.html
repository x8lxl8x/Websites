<h1>Accounting Research Bulletins - ARB</h1>

<p>Bulletins containing recommended accounting procedures for the accounting community. The publications are written and issued by the accounting principles board (APB), and were issued by the committee on accounting procedure of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) prior to 1959. While the recommendations are not binding in themselves, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) usually imposes the recommendations on firms over which it has jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are referred to a lot in accounting. GAAP represents not only any accounting laws in particular, but also the collection of accounting principles and suggestions that have accumulated throughout the years from the accounting research bulletins. APB itself has no enforcement over its suggestions, but GAAP is imposed by the SEC in the U.S.</p>
