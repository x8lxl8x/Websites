<h1>SEC Form ADV-NR</h1>

<p>A request for the appointment of agency with the SEC. This type of appointment is for a non-resident general partner or managing agent of an investment adviser. The form contains appointment of agent and consent clauses for the non-resident manager or partner of the adviser.</p>

<p>Form ADV-NR must be submitted along with the actual adviser's initial application. If the partner or manager becomes a non-resident after the original Form ADV has been submitted, then Form ADV-NR must be submitted within 30 days. This form actually relates to several major securities acts, including the Investment Adviser's Act of 1940 as well as the Securities Act of 1933, among others.</p>
