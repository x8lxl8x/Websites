<h1>Yuppie</h1>

<p>A slang term denoting the market segment of young urban professionals. A yuppie is often characterized by youth, affluence and business success.</p>

<p>Coined in the 1980s, the term yuppie was used as a derogatory title for young business people who were considered arrogant, undeservedly wealthy and obnoxious. Yuppies were often associated with wearing high fashion clothing, driving BMWs and gloating about their successes. The term has become less of a stereotype and now promotes the image of an affluent professional.</p>
