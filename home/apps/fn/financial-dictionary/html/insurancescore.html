<h1>Insurance Score</h1>

<p>A rating computed and used by insurance companies that represents the probability of a client filing an insurance claim during his or her coverage. The score is based on the client's credit rating and will impact the premiums he or she pays for the insurance coverage - a higher score will result in lower premiums, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Individual insurance scores are based on credit ratings because historical data reveals a positive correlation between poor credit ratings and insurance claims. A perfect insurance score represents a client with the lowest risk of filing a claim. Very few people have perfect scores; however, it is possible to have a very good score.</p>
