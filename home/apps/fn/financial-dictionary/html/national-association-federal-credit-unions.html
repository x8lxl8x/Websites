<h1>National Association Of Federal Credit Unions - NAFCU</h1>

<p>An industry trade group founded in 1967 that represents federal credit unions. Its membership is made up of both large and small credit unions, including about 80% of the 100 largest credit unions. Its activities include representing, informing, educating and assisting its members regarding industry issues. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, one of its main purposes is to influence the laws and regulations affecting federal credit unions.</p>

<p>Federal credit unions are similar to banks, but are owned by their members and are organized under federal rather than state law. They are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration, and members' deposits are protected by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, which is similar to FDIC insurance.</p>
