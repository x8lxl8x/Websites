<h1>Senior Registered Options Principal - SROP</h1>

<p>An officer or general partner of an options trading firm who supervises options exposure and trading activity in clients' accounts. SROPs also must have passed the Series 4 exam. FINRA eliminated the requirement for firms to have an SROP in June 2008. It also eliminated the requirement for firms to have a Compliance Registered Options Principal (CROP) to oversee the firm's regulatory compliance for its options trading activities, a position that was sometimes held by the SROP.</p>

<p>FINRA decided that multiple employees could manage an SROP's former responsibilities as long as the options trading firm continued to meet its supervisory and compliance requirements. Anyone supervising a firm's options and security futures business, including its sales and advertising activities, however, must be a Registered Options and Security Futures Principal.</p>
