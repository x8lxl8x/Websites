<h1>Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions - AAOIFI</h1>

<p>A not-for-profit organization that was established to maintain and promote Shariah standards for Islamic financial institutions, participants and the overall industry. The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) was created on February 26, 1990 to ensure that participants conform to the regulations set out in Islamic finance.</p>

<p>The founding and associate members, as well as the regulatory and supervisory authorities of the AAOIFI, define the acceptable standards for various functions. This includes areas such as accounting, governance, ethics, transactions and investment.</p>

<p>In Islamic finance there are unique rules, restrictions and requirements regarding business and investing. In order to be considered acceptable, transactions must adhere to the principals under Shariah. The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions sets compliance standards for institutions that wish to gain access to the Islamic banking market.</p>

<p>The AAOIFI is continually updating its scope to include the various new financial instruments entering markets around the world. For example, new hedging mechanisms would first need to be discussed and accepted by the AAOIFI before any member would offer these services.</p>
