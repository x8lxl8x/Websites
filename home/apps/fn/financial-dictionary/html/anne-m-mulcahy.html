<p>The former chair (2002-2010) and CEO (2001-2009) of Xerox Corp. Mulcahy has also held many senior management positions in the company, including president and chief operating officer. Born in 1952 in New York, Mulcahy began her career with Xerox in 1976 as a field sales representative and eventually became the company's first female chair and CEO. She helped to salvage the company by restructuring it instead of declaring bankruptcy and settling an accounting investigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
