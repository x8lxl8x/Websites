<h1>Tender Panel</h1>

<p>A method of financing pursuant to the sale of Euro notes through a revolving underwriting facility. Tender panels consist of a select group of 15 to 20 commercial and investment banks and receive permission from a borrower to solicit bids on a best-efforts basis to finance a project. The tender panel also functions as a selling agent for the banks that arrange the credit facility.</p>

<p>Tender panels are used to place medium-term Euro notes with large numbers of investors. They also separate the bank originating the issue from the purchasing banks. This effectively reallocates the credit risk among a large number of participants.</p>
