<h1>Market Maven</h1>

<p>A slang term used to describe an investor who is "in-the-know." The term "market maven" usually refers to an individual who is a market participant with a great deal of knowledge and connections, thus having a trusted opinion on market events or speculation. Historical success in the market is typically the driving force behind those who are considered mavens and those who are not.</p>

<p>In general, the term is used to describe consumers who have up-to-date information about products, places to shop and different markets. This definition makes sense when talking in the context of the stock market, as the nature of the market itself is highly speculative and based upon opinions in most cases. The media looks to market mavens for opinions and strategies for retail investors and onlookers to follow.</p>
