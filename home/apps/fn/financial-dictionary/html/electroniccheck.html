<h1>Electronic Check</h1>

<p>A form of payment made via the internet that is designed to perform the same function as a conventional paper check. Because the check is in an electronic format, it can be processed in fewer steps and has more security features than a standard paper check. Security features provided by electronic checks include authentication, public key cryptography, digital signatures and encryption, among others.</p>

<p>Also referred to as an "echeck".</p>

<p>Electronic checks have been developed in response to the transactions that have arisen in the world of electronic commerce. Electronic checks can be used to make a payment for any transaction that a paper check can cover and are governed by the same laws that apply to paper checks.</p>

<p>This is the first form of internet-based payment that the U.S. Treasury uses for making large online payments.</p>
