<h1>Settling Price</h1>

<p>The price used daily by clearing houses to clear all trades and settle accounts between clearing members. Also commonly referred to as "settlement price."</p>

<p>The settling price is calculated daily by the exchanges and used to identify margin deficiencies and invoice prices for deliveries.</p>

<p>The settling price is typically used as the closing price for futures contracts. As the closing prices of futures contracts generally fall within a range of prices, the settling price is calculated as the weighted average of transactions' prices during the closing period.</p>
