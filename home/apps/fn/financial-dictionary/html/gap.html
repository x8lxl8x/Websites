<h1>Gap</h1>

<p>A break between prices on a chart that occurs when the price of a stock makes a sharp move up or down with no trading occurring in between. Gaps can be created by factors such as regular buying or selling pressure, earnings announcements, a change in an analyst's outlook or any other type of news release.</p>

<p>An example of two different gaps can be seen in the chart above. Notice how the stock closes the trading session before the first gap at $50 and opens the next trading day near $46 with no trading occurring between the two prices. Gaps are a regular occurrence in all financial markets. However, they are rarely seen in the forex market since it is highly liquid and trades 24 hours a day.</p>
