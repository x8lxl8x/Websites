<h1>STARC Bands</h1>

<p>A type of technical indicator that is created by plotting two bands around a short-term simple moving average (SMA) of an underlying asset's price. The upper band is created by adding a value of the average true range (ATR) - a popular indicator used by technical traders - to the moving average. The lower band is created by subtracting a value of the ATR from the SMA.</p>

<p>Upper STARC band = SMA + ATR<SUP>*</SUP>
Lower STARC band = SMA - ATR<SUP>*</p>

<p></SUP>* The average true range (ATR) is generally multiplied by a user-specific multiplier factor before being added/subtracted from the SMA.</p>

<p>Most traders use a move toward the upper band to signal an increased probability that the price will pull back toward the moving average, and a move toward the lower band as a signal that the price may head back higher. Other traders believe a move beyond the bands signals an increase in momentum. STARC bands generally use a six-period moving average, and the average true range factor is usually multiplied by two before being added/subtracted from the SMA.</p>

<p>This indicator is similar in calculation and interpretation to Bollinger BandsÂ®.</p>

<p>STARC is an acronym for Stoller Average Range Channels. The indicator is named after its creator, Manning Stoller.           </p>
