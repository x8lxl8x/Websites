<h1>Unloved ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that has at least six months of trading history and where its last twenty trading sessions account for its lowest total dollar amount traded. Unloved ETFs may face shut down if they fail to attract enough investor interest to keep the funds competitive with other, more attractive funds.</p>

<p>Low investor interest in certain exchange-traded funds has ultimately led to these funds' closures. Often, these ETFs are based on ideas that are not appealing to a wide variety of investors, and, as a result, fail to gain any substantial market share. If a company decides to close one of its ETF offerings, investors can either wait for liquidation, at which point the fund firm closes the investors' accounts without charging a brokerage commission; or investors may choose to sell the ETF immediately. Some analysts advise selecting ETFs with at least $25 million in assets and sufficient investor interest.</p>
