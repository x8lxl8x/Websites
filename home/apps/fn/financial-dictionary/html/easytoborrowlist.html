<h1>Easy-To-Borrow List</h1>

<p>A list of securities deemed to be available for borrowing in short selling transactions because their delivery is assured. Availability is usually due to their accessible nature and/or high number of outstanding shares.</p>

<p>Also known as a blanket or standing assurances by members or associated persons, this easy-to-borrow list is updated every 24 hours. It gives firms the ability to transact short sells more readily, as they aren't required to research the availability of a stock every time it is requested for a short sale transaction. Instead they can assume that stocks on the list are readily available.</p>
