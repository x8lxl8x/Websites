<h1>Digital Wallet</h1>

<p>A system that securely stores users' payment information and passwords for numerous payment methods and websites. By using a digital wallet, users can complete purchases easily and quickly with near-field communications technology. They can also create stronger passwords without worrying about whether they will be able to remember them later. Digital wallets can be used in conjunction with mobile payment systems that allow customers to pay for purchases with their smart phones. They can also be used to store loyalty card information and digital coupons.</p>

<p>Also known as an e-wallet.</p>

<p>By storing all of a consumer's payment information securely and compactly, digital wallets largely eliminate the need to carry a physical wallet. Also, digital wallets are a potential boon to companies that collect consumer data. The more companies know about their customers' purchasing habits, the more effectively they can market to them. The downside for consumers is a loss of privacy.</p>
