<h1>Spot Loan</h1>

<p>A spot loan is a type of mortgage loan made for a borrower to purchase a single unit in a multi-unit building, such as a condo complex. Lenders sometimes require that they approve the entire building in order to approve a loan for an unit within the building. However, some lenders will make a spot loan when only the unit to be purchased has been approved by the lender, as long as the building meets certain broader requirements.</p>

<p>Spot loans are frequently associated with the FHA Spot Loan program. This program allowed condo buyers to obtain an FHA-insured loan on an individual unit in a building that had not been FHA approved. This program allowed borrowers to get loans on condos when they might not otherwise have qualified.</p>
