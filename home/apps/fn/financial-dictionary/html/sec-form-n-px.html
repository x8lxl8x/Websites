<h1>SEC Form N-PX</h1>

<p>A form completed by registered management investment companies and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to report its proxy voting record for each twelve-month period, ending on June 30 of each year. The report must be submitted not later than August 31. The SEC makes this information available to the public.</p>

<p>The filing requirements for Form N-PX are covered under Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require investment companies and trusts to file semiannual and annual reports with the SEC and shareholders.</p>

<p>Individuals should always be able to view a registered investment company's proxy voting record, by either accessing or requesting the information directly from the company or through the SEC's website. Many companies make the information available online under "Investor Relations," or by providing a toll-free number for people wishing to request a copy by mail.  By federal law, companies are required to provide their proxy voting records, free of charge, within three days of receiving a request.</p>
