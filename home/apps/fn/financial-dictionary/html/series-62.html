<h1>Series 62</h1>

<p>An exam administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for financial professionals seeking to become limited registered representatives for corporate equities and corporate debt securities. It tests an individual's knowledge of corporate equity and bond markets, security analysis and characteristics, industry regulations, and the handling of customer accounts.</p>

<p>The test consists of 115 questions taken over 150 minutes. A score of 70% or better is required for passing.</p>

<p>The Series 62 is more limited in scope than the Series 7 exam; licensed limited registered representatives can trade in equities, corporate bonds, preferred stocks and some asset-backed securities. They cannot trade in funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, such as open- and closed-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</p>
