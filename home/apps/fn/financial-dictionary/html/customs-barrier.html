<h1>Customs Barrier</h1>

<p>Any measure designed to limit international trade. A customs barrier will act to limit the level of trade across international borders by implementing restrictions on imports and/or exports. Governments may impose such restrictions in order to protect a domestic industry from foreign competition, or to limit the export of goods or services deemed vital to a domestic economy's health.</p>

<p>Also known as a "trade barrier".</p>

<p>Types of customs barrier can include tariffs, levies, duties and trade embargos. While most economists are in agreement that such measures ultimately create less-than-optimal economic conditions, governments often resort to them for a variety of reasons, ranging from protecting an infant industry to engaging in a trade war with another country.</p>
