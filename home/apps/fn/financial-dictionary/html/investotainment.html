<h1>Investotainment</h1>

<p>Television reporting about the stock market, the economy and other business and financial matters that appears to be news but may have more entertainment value than factual value. As such, it is generally not a good tool to use in making financial decisions. Investotainment seeks to entertain viewers with tactics such as fiery debates between talking heads and alarmist coverage of short-term fluctuations in stock prices.</p>

<p>The word "investotainment" is a play on the word "infotainment," which is a generally pejorative term for television news that is geared more toward increasing viewership ("soft news") than toward delivering important information ("hard news").</p>
