<h1>SEC Form 8-A</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as the Registration of Certain Classes of Securities. It is one of the basic forms used to register securities for offering to the public. Information required on this form includes the type of security, details of issuances, and key information about the issuer.</p>

<p>SEC Form 8-A is extremely useful to investors considering the purchase of any newly issued or soon-to-be issued security. Since many new companies do not immediately receive analyst coverage, savvy investors can use this form to fill in the gaps in their research.</p>
