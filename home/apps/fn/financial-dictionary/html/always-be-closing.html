<h1>Always Be Closing - ABC</h1>

<p>Retail jargon used to describe a sales strategy in which a salesperson should constantly look for new prospects, pitch products or services to those prospects and complete the sale. Always be closing (ABC), as a strategy, requires the salesperson to be persistent, but also know when to cut losses and move on to another prospect.</p>

<p>The phrase was popularized in the 1992 film "Glengarry Glen Ross". In the film, an aggressive representative from the corporate office is brought in to motivate a group real estate salesman to sell more property or be fired if they fail. The representative opines on the "always be closing" mentality, a strategy which ultimately pushes the characters to be unscrupulous and dishonest in order to avoid being fired.</p>
