<h1>Overshopped</h1>

<p>The perception that a firm's attempt to raise capital by selling equity or debt through a private or public offering is an act of desperation. When a company's management overshops a financing deal, it leaves investment banks, bridge financiers, lenders and private equity groups wondering why they should be the ones to take on the risk of financing a project that others have rejected.
The more rejections a company receives in trying to set up a financing deal, the closer it comes to being overshopped. Financiers closely scrutinize all financing deals, but overshopped deals receive extra scrutiny because more rejections imply a greater likelihood that the terms of the deal are flawed. Thus, financiers avoid overshopped deals. Even if there isn't anything wrong with a company that has been overshopped, repeated rejection tends to hurt the company's reputation. Overshopping can occur at various stages in the financing process and may involve parties that are not even capital financiers; the opinions of accountants, lawyers and insurance companies also count.           </p>
