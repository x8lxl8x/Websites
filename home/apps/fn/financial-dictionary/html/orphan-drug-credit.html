<h1>Orphan Drug Credit</h1>

<p>A federal tax credit that provides an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to seek treatments and cures for rare diseases affecting Americans. Normally, companies may not be motivated to make a drug for a small population because sales may be insufficient to justify the research and development costs of creating the drug. The Orphan Drug Credit provides a credit of 50% of clinical drug testing costs for drugs being tested under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</p>

<p>The credit can be applied whether the clinical tests are performed directly by the pharmaceutical company or are contracted out to a third party. In general, the testing must be conducted within the United States. Orphan drug credits allow pharmaceutical companies to create orphan drugs that target rare conditions.</p>
