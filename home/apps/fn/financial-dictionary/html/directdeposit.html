<h1>Direct Deposit</h1>

<p>Electronic funds that are deposited directly into your bank account rather than through a paper check. Common uses of a direct deposit include income tax refunds and pay checks.</p>

<p>As a whole, direct deposit is the most popular form of payment as it eliminates the risk of losing a check and eliminates the need to physically visit a bank to make a deposit.</p>

<p>Direct deposit allows an employee's pay to be immediately available in their accounts at midnight the day before pay day and it is not subject to a check clearing wait period. Salaries paid via check can take a week or more to clear within their account.</p>

<p>Direct deposits are also popular for income tax refunds, as it is the fastest method of payment.</p>
