<h1>Estimated Tax</h1>

<p>Periodic advance payment of taxes which are based upon the amount of income that is earned and the amount of estimated tax liability that will be incurred as a result. Estimated taxes are assessed on income that is not subject to any type of withholding, which includes self-employment income, dividend income, rental income, interest income and capital gains.</p>

<p>Estimated taxes are usually paid on a quarterly basis. If the estimated taxes that are paid do not equal at least 90% of the taxpayer's actual tax liability (or 100% or 110% of the taxpayer's prior-year liability, depending on the level of adjusted gross income), then interest and penalties are assessed against the delinquent amount.</p>
