<h1>Prophet's Reputation Management Index</h1>

<p>An index created by strategic brand and marketing consultancy Prophet that measures corporate reputation. Businesses that score 75 or more on the index qualify as reputation leaders, while those scoring under 50 receive a failing grade in terms of reputation management. The index, which was announced in December 2009, was based on Prophet's first U.S. Reputation study.</p>

<p>In its U.S. Reputation Study, Prophet queried 4,300 consumers on how 130 leading businesses fared in terms of terms of key reputation measures such as quality of products and services and their delivery. The survey revealed that less than 9% of U.S. consumers believe companies have strong reputations. The highest scores in the Reputation Management Index were earned by consumer packaged goods companies such as Kellogg's, Kraft Foods and General Mills.</p>
