<h1>Super PO</h1>

<p>A companion tranche structured as a Principal Only (PO) bond, which receives only principal payments from the underlying mortgages. A Super PO is designed to lend support to planned amortization class (PAC) and targeted amortization class (TAC) collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Super POs are priced at deep discounts to par or face value, and investors eventually receive the full face value through scheduled payments and prepayments.</p>

<p>The price of a super PO is very sensitive to interest rates, since they significantly influence prepayment rates on CMOs. When interest rates are low, high prepayment rates against the underlying PAC and TAC CMOs can significantly shorten the life of a Super PO, thereby boosting its yield because it is priced at a deep discount. Conversely, when interest rates are high and prepayments are below expectations, the life of the Super PO is extended and its yield is lowered.</p>
