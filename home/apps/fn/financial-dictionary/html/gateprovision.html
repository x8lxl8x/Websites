<h1>Gate Provision</h1>

<p>A restriction placed on a hedge fund limiting the amount of withdrawals from the fund during a redemption period. The implementation of a gate on a hedge fund is up to the hedge fund manager. The purpose of the provision is to prevent a run on the fund, which could cripple its operations, as a large number of withdrawals from the fund would force the manager to sell off a large number of positions.
This is a very common provision on a hedge fund and the exact percent of restriction can be found in the hedge fund prospectus. This is a less severe withdrawal restriction than an all out redemption suspension, which doesn't allow for withdrawals at all. But a gate provision is still seen generally as a negative event.           </p>
