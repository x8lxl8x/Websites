<h1>Eviction</h1>

<p>A landlord's legal removal of a tenant from his rental property. Eviction may occur when rent has not been paid, when the terms of the rental agreement have been breached or in certain other situations, such as the conversion of the rental unit to a condo.</p>

<p>In the United States, the eviction process is a matter of state law, so it varies from state to state. Tenants receiving eviction notices will often have a specified number of days to correct the problem that has led to the threat of eviction. For example, the tenant may have three days to pay rent in full before he must vacate the unit. If the tenant does not voluntary comply with the eviction notice, the issue must be resolved in court.</p>
