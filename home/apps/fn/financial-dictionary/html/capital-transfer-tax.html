<h1>Capital Transfer Tax</h1>

<p>An inheritance tax levied in the United Kingdom on estates exceeding a certain value. The Capital Transfer Tax replaced the general estate duty in 1975, and was itself replaced by the Inheritance Tax (IHT) in 1986. The amount of tax was derived from the value of the deceased's assets transfered within a certain time of the death (both real estate and personal), less charitable gifts.</p>

<p>Capital transfer taxes and other inheritance taxes make up a small portion of taxes collected in the United Kingdom. This is partially due to the nil rate band, which is the range of estate values that are excluded from the tax, as well as the various methods for avoiding its payment. Gifting an estate to charities or family members or creating a trust were two avoidance methods used.</p>
