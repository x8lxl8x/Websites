<h1>Recareering</h1>

<p>A late-in-life career change. Recareering is not just a job change, but a move to a completely different career path. Money, power and prestige are prime motivators for many people switching careers, but others do it to pursue a passion or make a lifestyle change.</p>

<p>Recareering can take two forms: it can be voluntary or it can occur unexpectedly. In voluntary recareering, an individual's current career might not provide the interest, passion or money that the person is seeking. Recareering can occur unexpectedly when a person's job is eliminated and there are few other opportunities in his or her field of expertise.</p>

<p>People often recareer later in life as a way of transitioning into retirement. Many individuals consider changing their careers or lifestyles to pursue fields that have always interested them, or to step out to launch their own businesses.</p>
