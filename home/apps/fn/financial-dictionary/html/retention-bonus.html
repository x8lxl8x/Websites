<h1>Retention Bonus</h1>

<p>A payment or reward outside of an employee's regular salary that is offered as an incentive to keep a key employee on the job during a particularly crucial business cycle, like a merger or acquisition, or during a crucial production period. In recent years, retention bonuses have become increasingly popular as corporate poaching has increased.</p>

<p>With the corporate landscape changing almost daily and a liquid labor market allowing workers to move from job to job more easily, retention bonuses have provided a great way for companies to keep valuable employees. Many believe that such methods add value to the business as well, as they reflect well on company's management and promote loyalty on both sides.</p>
