<h1>Depository Transfer Check - DTC </h1>

<p>A check used by a designated collection bank for depositing the daily receipts of a corporation from multiple locations. Depository transfer checks are one method of ensuring better cash management for companies that collect cash at multiple locations.</p>

<p>A third-party information service first transfers data on the day's receipts from the facility manager at each location to a concentration bank. Based on that data, the concentration bank then creates DTCs for each deposit location and enters them into the check-processing system.</p>

<p>A DTC is also known as a "depository transfer draft."</p>

<p>A DTC looks like a personal check, except that "Depository Transfer Check" is written across the top center of the face of the check, and the DTC does not bear a signature.</p>

<p>ACH has gradually dislodged DTC-based systems because it is faster, cheaper and more efficient. Firms that are not part of an ACH network must still use DTCs.</p>
