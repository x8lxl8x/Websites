<h1>National Market System Plan - NMSP</h1>

<p>A nationwide system used in the United States for the selection and reservation of securities symbols, and also for the collection, processing and distribution of quotation and transaction information for exchange-listed securities. The National Market System Plan consists of plans in which FINRA - the largest independent regulator for U.S. securities firms -  participates. These are the ISRA Plan, the CTA/CQ Plans, and the OTC UTP Plan. These NMS Plans are governed by section 11A of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.</p>

<p>The three NMS Plans in which FINRA participates are:</p>

<p>- The Intermarket Symbol Reservation Authority or ISRA Plan: this governs the establishment, operation and administration of a uniform system for the selection and reservation of one-to five-character securities symbols.</p>

<p>- Consolidated Tape Association/Consolidated Quotation Plan: governs the collection, processing and distribution of quotation and transaction information for exchange-listed securities, excluding those listed on the Nasdaq.</p>

<p>- OTC UTP Plan: governs the collection, processing and distribution of quotation and transaction information for issues listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.</p>
