<h1>Economic Secession</h1>

<p>The exchange of goods or services outside of a traditional economic system. Economic secession entails removing oneself from the use of fiat currency, instead relying on barter or commodity-based currencies to conduct transactions. Economic secession is a method of reducing government influence on economic decisions, because it does not utilize legal tender and is not subject to taxation.</p>

<p>Economic secession removes individuals or localities from a country's general economic network. This reduces the power of the government, since it no longer is able to use monetary policy to influence behavior. As such, it is considered a form of anarchy or part of the black economy. Tax avoidance is an example of economic secessio, in practice.</p>
