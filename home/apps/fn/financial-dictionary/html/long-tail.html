<h1>Long Tail</h1>

<p>In business, long tail is a phrase coined by Chris Anderson, in 2004. Anderson argued that products that are in low demand or have low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, but only if the store or distribution channel is large enough.</p>

<p>The tail of a distribution represents a period in time when sales for less common products return a profit due to reduced marketing and distribution costs. Long tail is when sales are made for goods not commonly sold. These goods can return a profit through reduced marketing and distribution costs.</p>

<p>The long tail also serves as a statistical property that states a larger share of population rests within the tail of a probability distribution, especially when it comes to buying patterns.</p>
