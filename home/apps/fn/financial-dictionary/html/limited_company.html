<h1>Limited Company - LC</h1>

<p>A form of incorporation that limits the amount of liability undertaken by the company's shareholders. The naming convention for this type of corporate structure is commonly used in the United Kingdom. It is commonly known as a limited liability company (LLC) in the United States and other parts of the world.</p>

<p>In a limited company, the debts of the company are separate from those of the shareholders. As a result, should the company experience financial distress because of normal business activity, the personal assets of shareholders will not be at risk of being seized by creditors. Ownership in the limited company can be easily transferred, and many of these companies have been passed down through generations.</p>
