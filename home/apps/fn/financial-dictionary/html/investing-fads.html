<h1>Investing Fads</h1>

<p>Investing fads are current popular trends that relate to investments. Investing fads are normally characterized by a temporary excessive enthusiam for a certain investing style, which is usually unsustainable in the long term. The dot-com bubble was an example of an investing fad where investors were more inclined to purchase a stock if its business had even the slightest exposure to the internet. That fad ended with the dot-com bubble burst.</p>

<p>Fads are sometimes confused with trends, but there is a major difference. Trends tend to persist over the longer-term and are usually based on fundamentals, whereas fads often die down after a shorter period. When investing, it is helpful to understand whether you are participating in a fad or a trend.</p>
