<h1>ARM Index</h1>

<p>The benchmark interest rate to which an adjustable rate mortgage is tied. An adjustable rate mortgage's interest rate consists of an index value plus a margin. The index underlying the adjustable rate mortgage is variable, while the margin is constant. There are several popular indexes used for different types of adjustable rate mortgages.</p>

<p>This is also referred to as the "fully indexed interest rate".</p>

<p>The index to which an adjustable rate mortgage is tied can make a difference over the life of the mortgage. For example, one popular mortgage index is the MTA index. It is a moving average calculation, and therefore has a "lag effect". If interest rates are expected to rise, a mortgage tied to the MTA index might be more economical than a mortgage tied to an index without a moving average calculation, such as the one-month LIBOR index. However, a borrower should consider more than the index when choosing an adjustable rate mortgage. Many other variables, such as the margin and the interest rate cap structure, are important considerations.</p>
