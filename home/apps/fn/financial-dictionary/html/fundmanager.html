<h1>Fund Manager</h1>

<p>The person(s) resposible for implementing a fund's investing strategy and managing its portfolio trading activities. A fund can be managed by one person, by two people as co-managers and by a team of three or more people. Fund managers are paid a fee for their work, which is a percentage of the fund's average assets under management.</p>

<p>Also known as an "investment manager".</p>

<p>The individuals involved in fund management (mutual, pension, trust funds or hedge funds) must have a high level of educational and professional credentials and appropriate investment managerial experience to qualify for this position. Investors should look for long-term, consistent fund performance with a fund manager whose tenure with the fund matches its performance time period.</p>

<p>The whole point of investing in a fund is to leave the investment management function to the professionals. Therefore, the quality of the fund manager is one of the key factors to consider when analyzing the investment quality of any particular fund.</p>
