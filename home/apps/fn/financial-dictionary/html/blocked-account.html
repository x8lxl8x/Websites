<h1>Blocked Account</h1>

<p>An account that is subject to foreign exchange controls in a country that restricts the amount of its currency that can be transferred to other countries or exchanged into other currencies.</p>

<p>It can also refer to accounts that are frozen, either by the U.S. government for political reasons, or for other reasons (such as death of the account holder.)</p>

<p>A blocked account is typically more serious than a frozen account, and the implication of the term is that it is longer term in nature. Once an account in the U.S. is blocked by government mandate (such as during a time of war or distress), no funds in the account can be accessed without a specific release from the U.S. Treasury.</p>
