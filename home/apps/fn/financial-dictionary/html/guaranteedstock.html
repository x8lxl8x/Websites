<h1>Guaranteed Stock</h1>

<p>An infrequently used form of common or preferred stock, whose dividends are guaranteed by a third party. Railroads and public utilities sometimes issue this kind of stock. The guaranteed dividend can increase the stock's price.</p>

<p>This can also refer to commonly purchased items that a company always keeps a supply of for customers to purchase.</p>

<p>A company cannot pay dividends unless it earns a profit. Since it can't guarantee that it will earn a profit, another company has to guarantee that it will pay the dividend.</p>

<p>By having guaranteed stock, a company can acquire an advantage over competitors who do not. However, it will face the costs associated with carrying a large amount of inventory.</p>
