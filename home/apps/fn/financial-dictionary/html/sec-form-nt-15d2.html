<h1>SEC Form NT15D2</h1>

<p>A form that is a variant of Form 12b-25, which is a notification of a late filing by a reporting company that determines that it is unable to complete a required periodic report when first due without unreasonable effort or expense. In this particular case, a company would have been late in filing a special financial report pursuant to Rule 15-d2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<p>A special financial form would have to be filed with the SEC if a company's registration statement did not contain certified financial statements for the registrant's last full fiscal year. Rule 15-d2 requires the filing of a special financial report within 90 days of the effective date of the registration statement, which contains certified financial statements that meet the requirements of the registrants' annual report form.</p>
