<h1>SEC Form F-7</h1>

<p>A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that publicly-traded Canadian foreign private issuers are required to use. These issuers must have had a class of its securities listed on a Canadian exchange for the 12 months preceding the filing. Form F-7 is issued when shareholders exercise a right to purchase. The SEC requires that if an issuer is registered using SEC Form F-7, then the rights must be granted to U.S. shareholders on terms no less favorable than those extended to the foreign shareholders. This form is a wraparound form for the relevant Canadian offering documents required by securities regulation in Canada.</p>

<p>SEC Form F-7 is also known as the Registration Statement for Securities of Certain Canadian Issuers Offered for Cash upon the Exercise of Rights Granted to Existing Security Holders, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. This Act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, which provide essential facts, be filed in order to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the Act's objectives: that investors are able to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.</p>
