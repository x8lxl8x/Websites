<h1>Carte Blanche</h1>

<p>A French term meaning "blank document." Carte blanche is commonly used in English to refer to a check that has been signed but does not have a dollar amount written in. The recipient of such a check then writes in whatever dollar amount he or she wants/needs.</p>

<p>The term carte blanche is more commonly used figuratively than literally. It usually means someone in power has given someone else the unconditional authority to spend money in a given situation and/or make decisions about that situation. This term is commonly used in politics and business. Carte blanche arrangements are often a bad idea because of their high potential for abuse.</p>
