<h1>Abandonment Clause</h1>

<p>A clause in a property insurance contract that, under certain circumstances, permits the property owner to abandon lost or damaged property and still claim a full settlement amount. If the insured party's property cannot be recovered, or the cost to recover or repair it is more than its total value, it can be abandoned and the insured party is entitled to a full settlement amount.</p>

<p>This type of insurance clause typically comes into play with marine property insurance, such as boats or watercraft. If a property owner's ship is sunk or lost at sea, the abandonment clause affords the owner the right to essentially "give up" on finding or recovering his or her property and subsequently collect a full insurance settlement from the insurer.</p>
