<h1>Renewable Energy Certificate - REC</h1>

<p>A certificate that is proof that one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource. Once the electricity provider has fed the electricity into the grid, the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) they received can then be sold on the open market as a commodity. Because of the additional cost for producing "green" energy, the RECs provide an additional income stream to the energy provider, thus making it a bit more attractive to produce.</p>

<p>Also known as Green Tags, Tradable Renewable Certificates (TRCs), and Renewable Energy Credits.</p>

<p>There is no national registry of RECs, however the multiple issuing firms work together to ensure continuity of requirements. As of 2008, the "green" technologies for producing electricity are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solar</li>
<li>Geothermal</li>
<li>No Dam Hydro</li>
<li>Wind</li>
<li>Bio Fuels (Mass and Diesel)</li>
<li>Hydrogen Fuel Cell</li>
</ul>
