<h1>Bullet Repayment</h1>

<p>A lump sum payment for the entire loan amount paid at maturity. A bullet repayment is often linked to ballon loans or similar products. Bullet repayments are usually built in to the terms of the loans.</p>

<p>For example, when a person has a five-year mortgage which is paid off in a lump sum at the end of the five-year term, this payment is considered a bullet repayment. Generally, the borrower only pays interest during this time, while the principal balance of the loan is due at the end of the term.</p>

<p>For large loan amounts, such as mortgage loans, refinancing is usually required in order to pay the entire bullet repayment amount.</p>
