<h1>Return On Research Capital - RORC</h1>

<p>A calculation used to assess the revenue a company brings in as a result of expenditures made on research and development activities. Return on research capital (RORC) is a component of productivity and growth, since research and development (R&D) is one of the ways in which companies develop new products and services for sale. This metric is commonly used in industries that rely heavily on R&D such as the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>Companies face an opportunity cost when examining the use of their funds. They can spend money on tangible assets, real estate or capital improvements, or they can invest in R&D. Investments made in research may take a number of years before tangible results are seen, and the return typically varies between industries and even within sectors of a particular industry.</p>
