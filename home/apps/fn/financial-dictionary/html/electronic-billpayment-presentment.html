<h1>Electronic Bill Payment & Presentment - EBPP   </h1>

<p>A process used by companies to collect payments via the internet, direct dial access, ATM or other electronic method. Electronic Bill Payment & Presentment (EBPP) is a core component of financial institutions' online bank offerings. There are typically two types of EBPPs: biller-direct and bank-aggregator.
