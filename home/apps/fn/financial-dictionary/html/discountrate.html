<h1>Discount Rate</h1>

<p>1. The interest rate that an eligible depository institution is charged to borrow short-term funds directly from a Federal Reserve Bank. Different types of loans are available from Federal Reserve Banks and each corresponding type of credit has its own discount rate.</p>

<p>2. The interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate takes into account the time value of money (the idea that money available now is worth more than the same amount of money available in the future because it could be earning interest) and the risk or uncertainty of the anticipated future cash flows (which might be less than expected).</p>

<p>1. This type of borrowing from the Fed is fairly limited. Institutions will often seek other means of meeting short-term liquidity needs. The Federal Funds Discount Rate is determined by the average rate which banks are willing to charge each other for overnight funds.</p>

<p>2. Let's say you expect $1,000 dollars in one year's time. To determine the present value of this $1,000 (what it is worth to you today) you would need to discount it by a particular rate of interest. Assuming a discount rate of 10%, the $1,000 in a year's time would be the equivalent of $909.09 to you today (1000/[1.00 + 0.10]).</p>
