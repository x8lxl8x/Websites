<h1>Noise Trader Risk</h1>

<p>A form of market risk associated with the investment decisions of noise traders. The higher the volatility in market price for a particular security, the greater the associated noise trader risk</p>

<p>Behavioral finance researchers have attempted to isolate this risk in order to explain and capitalize upon the sentiment of the majority of investors. Noise trader risk is assumed to be more readily found in small-cap stocks, but has also been identified mid- and large-caps.</p>

<p>For example, if the noise trader risk for a particular stock is high, an issuance of good news related to a particular company may influence more noise traders to buy the stock, artificially inflating its market value.</p>
