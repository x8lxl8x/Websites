<h1>Lis Pendens</h1>

<p>An official notice to the public that a lawsuit has been filed. Lis Pendens refers to the concept that any buyer of property must assume any litigation that exists pertaining to the property. If a buyer purchases a lot that a bank was suing the former owner for, then the new owner must face the lawsuit. Sale of the property will not prevent the plaintiff from seeking redress via litigation.</p>

<p>Lis Pendens is literally translated from Latin as "suit pending". Obviously, this condition can adversely affect the sale price - or possibility of sale - of a piece of property substantially. The term is commonly abbreviated "lis pend".</p>
