<h1>Mutual Investment Certificate</h1>

<p>A certificate issued by a local or municipal authority for the purpose of funding a public works project. This type of obligation is financed by an tax assessment made upon the residents that will benefit from the facility. Mutual investment certificate income is always tax-free to the recipient.</p>

<p>These certificates essentially function as a type of general obligation bond, although they are technically in a different category. They are not backed directly by revenue from the project, but by the local taxpayers. The revenue from the projects behind the certificates also may be collected directly by the contractor building or renovating the facility, instead of the locality.</p>
