<h1>Zakat</h1>

<p>A term used in Islamic finance to refer to the obligation that an individual has to donate a certain proportion of wealth each year to charitable causes. Zakat is a mandatory process for Muslims in order to physically and spiritually purify their yearly earnings that are over and above what is required to provide the essential needs of a person or family.</p>

<p>There are comprehensive descriptions in religious texts describing minimum amounts of zakat with regards to farm produce, cattle, business activities, paper currency and precious metals such as gold and silver.</p>

<p>The most common level of zakat on wealth from cash, equities and gold is 2.5% of the total value.</p>
