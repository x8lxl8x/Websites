<h1>Russia ETF</h1>

<p>An exchange-traded fund that invests in Russian stocks, either through local stocks directly or via American depositary receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts listed on U.S. and European exchanges. Russia ETFs seek to replicate broad market Russian averages; invested assets may represent a high portion of the net market capitalization of all publicly traded Russian stocks.
Another source of investing into Russian equities would be to buy "BRIC" ETFs, which invest within Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>

<p>Russia, along with the other BRIC nations, is considered one of the brightest emerging markets in the world. Although Russian equities have not always done well, Russia does have many rich natural resources such as oil, timber, metals and diamonds.</p>
