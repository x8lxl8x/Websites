<h1>Registered Options Principal - ROP</h1>

<p>An employee at a brokerage firm that is responsible for supervising options' exposure and the trading activities on options within client accounts. The ROP acts between the client making the order and the exchange member who executes the order.</p>

<p>In a brokerage firm there is often more than one ROP. In some cases, one is the designated ROP, while another is the alternate ROP. The alternate ROP acts as a subordinate to the designated ROP. Both positions are often taken by senior employees, more specifically either a partner, officer, or director of the firm.</p>

<p>In the United States, an individual wishing to become a ROP must take and pass the Series 4 securities license course provided by the National Association of Securities Dealers. In Canada, a potential ROP must pass the The Options Supervisors Course provided by the Canadian Securities Institute.</p>
