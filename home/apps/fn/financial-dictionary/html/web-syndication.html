<h1>Web Syndication</h1>

<p>A term that refers to a marketing strategy for websites. Web syndication describes an arrangement between two or more Internet companies for one company to provide material to be made available on the other party's site. Web syndication allows the company providing the material to garner additional page views, depth and exposure to their site. The benefits for the site hosting the provided material are fresh new content and additional traffic.</p>

<p>In general, web syndications are free arrangements if they are equally and mutually beneficial to both parties. However, sometimes a website may wish to pay for syndication to get their material placed in a specific location on a high-traffic site. The bigger the distributor's site, the bigger the fee usually is.</p>
