<h1>Mutual Fund Liquidity Ratio</h1>

<p>A ratio published monthly by the Investment Company Institute that compares the amount of cash relative to total assets held by a mutual fund. Equity investors use the mutual fund liquidity ratio to gauge the demand for shares and the bullishness or bearishness of portfolio managers.</p>

<p>For example, if a mutual fund is sitting on a large amount of cash, the theory is that it is doing so because it is hard pressed to find quality investment opportunities; therefore, it has a bearish sentiment toward the market. Conversely, if a mutual fund is highly invested and has a very small amount of cash on hand, the theory is that it has found some excellent investing opportunities and is taking advantage of these opportunities by being nearly fully invested - that is to say, it is bullish.</p>
