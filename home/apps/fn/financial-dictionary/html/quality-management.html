<h1>Quality Management</h1>

<p>The act of overseeing all activities and tasks needed to maintain a desired level of excellence. This includes creating and implementing quality planning and assurance, as well as quality control and quality improvement. It is also referred to as total quality management (TQM).</p>

<p>While quality control and quality assurance departments have been around for a long time, the concept of quality management is relatively new. In a sense, it is a "first cause" approach to quality assurance, as it approaches the issue of quality from many different angles.</p>
