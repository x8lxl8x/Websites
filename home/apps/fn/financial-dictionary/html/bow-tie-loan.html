<h1>Bow Tie Loan</h1>

<p>A short-term, variable-rate loan in which unpaid interest charges above a predetermined interest rate are deferred. A variable-rate loan is a loan in which the interest rate fluctuates in response to market interest rates. So, when bow tie loans are issued, a predetermined interest rate is set and whenever the market rate goes up past that rate, interest payments for investors are deferred until the end of the loan's maturity.</p>

<p>For example, let's say a company wants to take out a bow tie loan of $100,000, current interest rates are 15% and the lending company has set a limit interest rate of 22%. At 22%, the company is paying $22,000 in interest payments. In the event that interest rates rise above 22% to, say, 26%, the interest payments will rise from $22,000 to $26,000. In this case, the company is still liable for $22,000 of interest payments, but the difference of $4,000 ($26,000 - $22,000) is deferred until the loan's maturity date.</p>
