<h1>Collateral Trust Bond</h1>

<p>A bond that is secured by a financial asset - such as stock or other bonds - that is deposited and held by a trustee for the holders of the bond.</p>

<p>If the issuing company were to default on the debt obligation, the debt holders would receive the securities held in trust, like collateral for a loan.</p>

<p>For example, say Company A issues a collateral trust bond, and as collateral for the bond it includes the right to Company A shares held by a trust company. If Company A were to default on the bond payments, the bondholders would be entitled to the shares held in trust.</p>
