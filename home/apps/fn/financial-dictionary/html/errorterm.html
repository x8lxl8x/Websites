<h1>Error Term</h1>

<p>A variable in a statistical and/or mathematical model, which is created when the model does not fully represent the actual relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. As a result of this incomplete relationship, the error term is the amount at which the equation may differ during empirical analysis.</p>

<p>The error term is also known as the "residual", or the "remainder" term.</p>

<p>An error term essentially means that the model will not be completely accurate, and will result in differing results during real world applications. For example, assume there is a multiple linear regression function that takes the form:</p>

<p>When the actual Y differs from the Y in the model during an empirical test, then the error term will not be equal to 0, which means there are other factors that influence Y.</p>
