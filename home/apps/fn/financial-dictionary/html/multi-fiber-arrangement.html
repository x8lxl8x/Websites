<h1>Multi-Fiber Arrangement - MFA</h1>

<p>An international trade agreement on textile and clothing that was active from 1974 till 2004. The agreement imposed quotas on the amount that developing countries could export in the form of yarn, fabric and clothing to developed countries.</p>

<p>Under the MFA, the United States and the European Union restricted imports from developing countries in an effort to protect their own domestic industries. Under the agreement, each developed country was assigned a quota or quantities of a specific item which could be exported to the U.S. and EU.</p>
