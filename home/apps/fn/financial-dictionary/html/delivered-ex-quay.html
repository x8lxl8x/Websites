<h1>Delivered Ex Quay - DEQ</h1>

<p>In international trade, a contract specification where the seller must deliver the goods to the wharf at the destination port. Delivered ex quay may be noted as having duty paid or unpaid. If it is marked as paid, the seller is responsible for any costs, such as duty, and risks associated with the delivery. The buyer must pay the costs and duty when the DEQ is marked as "duty unpaid."</p>

<p>Delivered ex quay is an alternative to delivered ex ship (DES). With a DES specification, the seller must make the goods available on board a ship at the destination port. DEQ changes the specification, noting that the goods must be delivered to the wharf.</p>

<p>It's important to realize that because this is a legal term, its exact definition is much more complicated and differs by country. It is suggested that you contact an international trade lawyer before using any trade term.</p>
