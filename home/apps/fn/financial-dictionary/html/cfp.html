<h1>Certified Financial Planner - CFP</h1>

<p>The CFP legal team has provided its official definition, along with trademarks: CFP and Certified Financial Planner marks are certification marks owned by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. These marks are awarded to individuals who successfully complete the CFP Board's initial and ongoing certification requirements.</p>

<p>Those wanting to become a CFP professional must take extensive exams in the areas of financial planning, taxes, insurance, estate planning and retirement. Attaining the CFP designation takes experience and a substantial amount of work. CFP professionals must also complete continuing education programs each year to maintain their certification status. It is always good idea to ask about a professional's educational background and references before allowing a CFP designee (or any other financial professional) to manage your money. Don't be afraid to say "no thanks" if you feel that the person doesn't have sufficient experience.</p>
