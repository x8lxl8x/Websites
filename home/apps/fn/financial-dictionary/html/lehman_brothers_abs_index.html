<h1>Lehman Brothers Asset-Backed Securities Index</h1>

<p>A fixed-income index that focuses on asset-backed securities. The Lehman Brothers Asset-Backed Securities Index serves as the performance benchmark for many ABS funds. The index includes pass-through, controlled-amortization and bullet-structured securities, which have a minimum average life of one year.</p>

<p>The Lehman Brothers ABS Index is a subset of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, a primary benchmark for bond funds. The ABS index focuses on three forms of asset-backed debt: credit cards, auto loans and home equity loans. All securities in this index are from senior classes of an issue, which means no subordinated tranches are included.</p>
