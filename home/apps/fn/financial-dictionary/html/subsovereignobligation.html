<h1>Sub-Sovereign Obligation - SSO</h1>

<p>A form of debt obligation issued by hierarchical tiers below the ultimate governing body of a nation, country, or territory. This form of debt comes from bond issues and is issued by states, provinces, cities or towns in order to fund municipal and local projects.</p>

<p>Also referred to as a "municipal (muni) debt obligation".
This form of debt obligation is commonly created by municipalities in order to meet funding requirements. Issuing bodies are responsible for their own debt issues, which can carry significant risk depending on the financial health of the municipality.           </p>
