<h1>Stabilizing Bid</h1>

<p>A practice used by underwriters to stabilize the secondary market price of a security after an initial public offering (IPO). The bid is made on behalf of the IPO's underwriters to repurchase shares at the offer price.</p>

<p>Stabilizing bids are one of many methods used by underwriters to support the price of the IPO. Stabilizing bids may be used to support a stock that has high selling pressure from investors looking to "flip" their purchased shares for a quick profit. Any attempt to use a stabilizing bid by an underwriter must be made known to the regulatory body of the market.</p>
