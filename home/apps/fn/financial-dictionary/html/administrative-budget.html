<h1>Administrative Budget</h1>

<p>An official, detailed financial plan for an upcoming period for a business. An administrative budget is usually prepared on an annual or quarterly basis and identifies the costs of running an operation that are not tied to producing a product or service. Costs can include those associated with non-production and supervisory payroll, depreciation, amortization, consulting, sales, dues and fees, legal fees and marketing, rent and insurance. The budget enables management to exercise control of the day-to-day activities of the business.</p>

<p>An administrative budget deals with the administrative side of running a business. Non-production payroll may include sales staff, accounting personnel, managers, clerical staff and other support staff members not involved in production. An administrative budget is a formal breakdown of all planned expenses, allowing managers to make estimations and measure progress.</p>
