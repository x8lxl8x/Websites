<h1>Diluted Founders</h1>

<p>A slang term often used by venture capitalists to describe the process by which the founders of a startup gradually lose ownership of the company they founded. As a startup that is using venture capital for funding progresses through multiple rounds of financing, the venture capitalists providing the financing will often want more and more ownership of the company.</p>

<p>In other words, the founders dilute their ownership in the company in exchange for capital to grow their business.</p>

<p>What percentage of the company should a founder hold onto, ideally, after the venture capitalists take their piece of the pie? There is no gold standard, but generally anything between (or above) 15-25% ownership for the founders is considered a success.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the trade of ownership for capital is beneficial to both venture capitalist and founder. Diluted ownership of a $500 million company is a lot more valuable than sole ownership of a $10 million company.</p>
