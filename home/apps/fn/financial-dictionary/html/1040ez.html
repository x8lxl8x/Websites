<h1>1040EZ Form</h1>

<p>The 1040EZ is an alternative to the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) 1040 income tax form and offers a faster and easier way to file taxes, meant for taxpayers with rudimentary tax situations. In order to be eligible to use this form, the individual must have a taxable income of less than $100,000, interest income of $1,500 or less, possess no dependents and fulfill other requirements set by the IRS.</p>

<p>Also known as "income tax return for single and joint filers with no dependents" and unofficially as the "easy form".</p>

<p>For most individuals, the 1040EZ is the first tax form they will fill out. For example, a young adult with a part-time job will file a tax return at the end of the year. This person will have a straightforward and simple tax situation if she or he has no real estate assets, no tax shelters and no foreign income; only the most basic information is needed to determine whether any money is owed or refunded.</p>

<p>As an individual's taxation situation becomes more complicated by having a child and claiming a dependent, he or she may need to file under the Form 1040A or Form 1040.</p>
