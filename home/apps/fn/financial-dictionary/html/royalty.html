<h1>Royalty</h1>

<p>A payment to an owner for the use of property, especially patents, copyrighted works, franchises or natural resources. A royalty payment is made to the legal owner of a property, patent, copyrighted work or franchise by those who wish to make use of it for the purposes of generating revenue or other such desirable activities. In most cases, royalties are designed to compensate the owner for the asset's use, and are legally binding.</p>

<p>Royalties are often expressed as a percentage of the revenues obtained using the owner's property, but can be negotiated to meet the specific needs of an arrangement. The use of royalties is common in situations where an inventor or original owner chooses to sell their product to a third party in exchange for royalties from the future revenues it may generate.</p>
