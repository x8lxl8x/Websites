<h1>Account Manager</h1>

<p>An employee who is responsible for the day-to-day management of a particular customer's account with the business. The account manager is a point of contact, and provides customer support, upselling, technical assistance and general relationship management. An account manager may be in charge of a number of smaller accounts, or may focus on a few larger accounts.</p>

<p>Companies use account managers to ensure that customers feel that their needs are being met. It is generally less expensive to keep existing clients than to seek new clients to replace those that have defected as a result of inadequate customer service. Account managers work closely with the sales team to ensure that it is clear what products or services the client has purchased, and that those products and services fit the client's needs.</p>
