<h1>Custodial Care</h1>

<p>Non-medical care that helps individuals with his or her activities of daily living, preparation of special diets and self-administration of medication not requiring constant attention of medical personnel. Providers of custodial care are not required to undergo medical training.
Most public long-term care (LTC) programs such as Medicaid cover custodial care as long as it is provided within a nursing facility. Custodial care at home is typically covered only under LTC insurance - not by Medicaid - even though home care is cheaper than a nursing facility. Medicare, on the other hand, covers only medically necessary, skilled care and will cover at-home custodial care only if it is provided in conjunction with skilled care.           </p>
