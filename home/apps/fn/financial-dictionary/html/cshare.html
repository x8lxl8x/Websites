<h1>C-Share</h1>

<p>A class of mutual fund with a level load. Class C shares don't have front-end loads, but have small back-end loads that are typically around 1% and may vanish once the shares have been held for a year. They have lower expense ratios than class B shares, but higher expense ratios than class A shares. Class C shares can be a good option for investors who will sell after a relatively short period, but will hold the shares for at least a year.</p>

<p>Investors who plan to withdraw funds within a year may want to avoid C-shares because of the back-end load that is typically charged on short-term redemptions. At the same time, the higher ongoing expenses associated with C-shares make them an unappealing option for long-term investors. Countless mutual funds offer both low ongoing expenses and no front- or back-end loads, so it is easy to avoid the drawbacks associated with C-shares. Higher mutual fund fees are not associated with higher mutual fund returns.</p>
