<h1>Current Face</h1>

<p>The current par value of a mortgage-backed security (MBS). Current face is determined by multiplying the current pool factor by the mortgage-backed security's original face value. A mortgage-backed security's current face represents the outstanding principal balance (or its outstanding face value) of the mortgage's underlying the security.</p>

<p>If the MBS pays interest and principal on payment dates, the current face will decline after each payment is made.</p>

<p>Different mortgage-backed securities with the same issue date, same coupon and same original face value can have greatly different current faces. Mortgage-backed securities pay down at different rates based on the characteristics of the underlying loans and on the actual prepayment speed of underlying mortgages.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that two mortgage-backed securities (MBS 1 and MBS 2) have the same original face value, but MBS 1 experiences faster prepayments then MBS 2. In this case, MBS 1 will have a lower current face value then MBS 2 as time progresses.</p>
