<h1>Treynor Ratio</h1>

<p>A ratio developed by Jack Treynor that measures returns earned in excess of that which could have been earned on a riskless investment per each unit of market risk.</p>

<p>The Treynor ratio is calculated as:</p>

<p>(Average Return of the Portfolio - Average Return of the Risk-Free Rate) /  Beta of the Portfolio</p>

<p>In other words, the Treynor ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of return based on systematic risk. It is similar to the Sharpe ratio, with the difference being that the Treynor ratio uses beta as the measurement of volatility.</p>

<p>Also known as the "reward-to-volatility ratio".</p>
