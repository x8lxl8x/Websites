<h1>Digits Deleted</h1>

<p>A designation on an exchange's ticker tape that refers to the absence of one or more price digits caused by tape delay. Digits deleted comes into effect when the tape announcements start falling too far behind trading activity. Only the last digit and fraction are reported until the tape catches up.</p>

<p>By deleting digits, the tape saves space and is able to report more prices in a shorter amount of time. When the tape catches up with the trading activity, the numbers begin reporting as normal. The end of digits deleted is known as digits resumed.</p>

<p>For example, the price of 34 1/5 would become 4 1/5 under digits deleted.</p>
