<h1>Non-Accredited Investor</h1>

<p>An investor who does not meet the net worth requirements for an accredited investor under the Securities & Exchange Commission's  Regulation D. A non-accredited individual investor is one who has a net worth of less than $1 million (including spouse) and who earned less than $200,000 annually ($300,000 with spouse) in the last two years.</p>

<p>When a company raises private equity for an investment, such as a new company or a hedge fund, it is able to receive unlimited investments from accredited investors. On the other hand, Regulation D stipulates only 35 non-accredited investors are allowed to invest money into a private placement.</p>
