<h1>Guppy Multiple Moving Average - GMMA</h1>

<p>An indicator used in technical analysis to identify changing trends. The technique consists of  combining two groups of moving averages with differing time periods.</p>

<p>One set of moving averages in the Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) has a relatively brief time frame and is used to determine the activity of short-term traders. The number of days used in the set of short-term averages is usually 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 or 15.</p>

<p>The other group of averages is created with extended time periods and is used to gauge the activity of long-term investors. The long-term averages usually use periods of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or 60 days.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two sets of moving averages is used by traders to determine if the outlook of short-term traders aligns with investors who have a longer-term outlook.</p>

<p>Changing trends are identified when the two groups of moving averages intersect. A bullish trend is present when the short-term moving averages are above the long-term averages. Conversely, a bearish trend occurs when the short-term averages are below the long-term averages.</p>

<p>This term gets its name from Daryl Guppy, an Australian trader who is credited with its development.</p>
