<h1>Form T</h1>

<p>A form that FINRA requires brokers to use for reporting equity trades executed outside of normal market hours. Form T trades occur during extended hours - before the market opens and after it closes. The objective of the Form T reports is to maintain market transparency and integrity.</p>

<p>Trading in extended hours enables investors to react quickly to events that typically occur outside regular market hours, such as earnings reports. However, liquidity may be constrained during such Form T trading, resulting in wide bid-ask spreads. Form T trading is especially suited for overseas investors, since they may conduct the bulk of their U.S. trading when their markets are open but U.S. markets are closed.</p>

<p>The growing popularity of electronic communication networks means that Form T trading is bound to continue increasing.</p>
