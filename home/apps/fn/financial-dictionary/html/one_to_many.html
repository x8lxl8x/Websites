<h1>One To Many</h1>

<p>A trading platform where all buyers and sellers transact with a sole market operator. Whereas a normal exchange involves the operator matching buyers with sellers, a one-to-many platform operator will purchase the assets from the sellers and sell to the buyers. All bids and offers are posted by the platform operator.</p>

<p>A one-to-many market involves one group or organization transacting with multiple buyers and sellers. The Commodity Exchange Act does not recognize one-to-many markets as official trading facilities. The most infamous example of a one-to-many trading platform was Enron's EOL, an online internet trading platform. Market manipulation, false reporting and wash trading brought Enron EOL to a crashing halt.</p>
