<h1>Welfare State</h1>

<p>A concept of government in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. A welfare state is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions of a good life. Under this system, the welfare of its citizens is the responsibility of the state.</p>

<p>Under this method, the government oversees and administers healthcare, education, employment, social security and other resources that help maintain the standard of living of the state's citizens.</p>

<p>Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI) is one of these programs. SSI is a federal income supplement program funded by general tax revenues, not by Social Security taxes that was initiated in order to help the less fortunate.</p>
