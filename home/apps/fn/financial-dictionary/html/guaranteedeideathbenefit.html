<h1>Guaranteed Earning Increase Death Benefit</h1>

<p>A type of option that annuitants can purchase for their retirement annuities. This option would guarantee the beneficiary that the plan would receive an additional pre-determined amount of money that would be above and beyond the death benefit in the event that the annuitant dies before the annuity's maturity.
For example, Jack had purchased a guaranteed earning increase death benefit option of 5% on his $150,000 retirement annuity. If Jack passes away before he can start collecting his annuity, his beneficiary, Jill, will be able to collect a total of $157,000 ($150,000 + 5% of $150,000).           </p>
