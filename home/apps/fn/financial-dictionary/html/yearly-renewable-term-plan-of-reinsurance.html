<h1>Yearly Renewable Term Plan of Reinsurance</h1>

<p>A type of life reinsurance where mortality risks are transferred to a reinsurer. In the yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance, the primary insurer (the ceding company) yields to a reinsurer its net amount at risk (the difference between the face value and the cash value of a life insurance policy) for the amount that is greater than the retention limit on a life insurance policy to a reinsurer. If the insured dies, the reinsurance pays the portion of the death benefit that is equal to the net amount of risk.</p>

<p>Also called yearly renewable term (YRT) or risk premium reinsurance basis.</p>

<p>Reinsurance allows insurance companies to reduce the financial risks associated with insurance claims by spreading some of the risk to another institution. A yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance allows the primary insurance company to spread some of the risk involved in a life insurance policy to another institution. The premium paid by the ceding company for the reinsurance varies based on the policyholder's age, plan and policy year.</p>
