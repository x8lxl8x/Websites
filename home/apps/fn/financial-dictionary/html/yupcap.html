<h1>Yupcap</h1>

<p>A slang term for a young urban professional who cannot afford property. Yupcaps are people in their late twenties or early thirties with post secondary educations and well-paying jobs who are unable to purchase property due to factors such as high real estate prices, limited personal savings and limited credit history, all of which can make it difficult to get approved for a mortgage.</p>

<p>Yupcaps are a result of rising prices in the North American real estate market, where mortgages and affordable housing are difficult to obtain due to high housing prices. Despite having a steady stream of income in a good paying job, yupcaps often find it extremely difficult to purchase a home in the marketplace. These people often need to wait until they build up a larger down payment, purchase a home with another person, or get help from their parents. Yupcaps' situation contrasts with that of their parents, who could more easily afford their first homes.</p>
