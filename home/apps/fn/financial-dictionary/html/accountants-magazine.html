<h1>The Accountant's Magazine - TAM</h1>

<p>A Scottish trade publication that covered topics related to accountancy as a profession. <i>The Accountant's Magazine</i> helped establish accounting as a skilled profession at a time when chartered accountants were just becoming recognized as legitimate.</p>

<p><i>The Accountant's Magazine</i> was first published in 1897, and was taken over by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland (ICAS) in 1951. It was funded through subscriptions, but received the bulk of its financial support from accounting professional groups. Numerous subjects are covered in the magazine including financial accounting, managerial accounting, international accounting and others.</p>
