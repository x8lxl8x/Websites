<h1>Barrels Of Oil Equivalent Per Day - BOE/D</h1>

<p>A term that is used often in conjunction with the production or distribution of oil. One barrel of oil is generally deemed to have the same amount of energy content as 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas.</p>

<p>Large oil producers are evaluated and refer to their production by the number of cubic feet of natural gas, and/or by the barrels of oil equivalent, they produce per day. This is an industry standard, and a way that investors can compare the production and/or the reserves of two oil/gas companies.</p>
