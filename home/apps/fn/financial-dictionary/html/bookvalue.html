<h1>Book Value</h1>

<p>1. The value at which an asset is carried on a balance sheet. To calculate, take the cost of an asset minus the accumulated depreciation.</p>

<p>2. The net asset value of a company, calculated by total assets minus intangible assets (patents, goodwill) and liabilities.</p>

<p>3. The initial outlay for an investment. This number may be net or gross of expenses such as trading costs, sales taxes, service charges and so on.</p>

<p>Also known as "net book value (NBV)."</p>

<p>In the U.K., book value is known as "net asset value."
Book value is the accounting value of a firm. It has two main uses:</p>

<p>1. It is the total value of the company's assets that shareholders would theoretically receive if a company were liquidated.</p>

<p>2. By being compared to the company's market value, the book value can indicate whether a stock is under- or overpriced.</p>

<p>3. In personal finance, the book value of an investment is the price paid for a security or debt investment. When a stock is sold, the selling price less the book value is the capital gain (or loss) from the investment.</p>
