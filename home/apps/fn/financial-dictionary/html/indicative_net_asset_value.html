<h1>Indicative Net Asset Value - iNAV</h1>

<p>A measure of the intraday net asset value (NAV) of an investment, such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which gives an updated measure of the value of the investment based on its assets less its liabilities. An investment's NAV is usually calculated at the end of the trading day, but the indicative NAV measure gives a more real-time view of this value.</p>

<p>Also referred to as "indicative value".</p>

<p>Indicative NAV is not the price at which you can purchase the instrument; it is only used as a reference for the investment's underlying value. In many cases, the ETF will actually trade at a premium or discount to the NAV due to various factors, including supply and demand, and expectations.</p>
