<h1>FV - Continuous Compounding</h1>

<p>The future value with continuous compounding formula is used in calculating the later value of a current sum of money. Use of the future value with continuous compounding formula requires understanding of 3 general financial concepts, which are time value of money, future value as it applies to the time value of money, and continuous compounding.</p>

<h2>Time Value of Money, Future Value, and Continuous Compounding</h2>
<p><b><i>Time Value of Money</i></b>  - The future value with continuous compounding formula relies on the underlying concept of time value of money. Time value of money is the notion that a current sum of money(or unit of account) is worth more today than the same amount at a future date.</p>
<p><b><i>Future Value</i></b>  - Future value expands upon the idea of time value of money in that it quantifies the amount required at a later date. For example, suppose that an individual has a choice between receiving $1000 today or $1050 one year from today. Is the additional $50 worth waiting one year for? Can the individual invest elsewhere and make a higher return? Could the individual use the $1000 now for a higher "utility of enjoyment" than the $50 warrants? The future value with continuous compounding formula calculates the later value when there is continuous compounding.</p>
<p><b><i>Continuous Compounding</i></b>  - Continuous compounding is compounding that is in constant motion as opposed to incremental steps. Continuous compounding is considered to have an infinite amount of compounding periods for a certain period of time because there is no incremental steps as found in monthly or annual compounding.</p>
<p>Particularly the last 2 of these concepts lends to the actual formula for future value with continuous compounding.</p>

<h2>Example of FV with Continuous Compounding Formula</h2>
<p>An example of the future value with continuous compounding formula is an individual would like to calculate the balance of her account after 4 years which earns 4% per year, continuously compounded, if she currently has a balance of $3000.</p>
<p>The variables for this example would be 4 for time,  <b><i>t</i></b> , .04 for the rate,  <b><i>r</i></b> , and the present value would be $3000. The equation for this example would be</p>

<p>which return a result of $3520.53.</p>
