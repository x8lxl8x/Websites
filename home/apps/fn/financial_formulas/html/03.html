<h1>Annuity (FV)- Solve for n</h1>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Solve%20for%20n%20-%20Annuity%20(FV)%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The formula for solving for number of periods ( <b><i>n</i></b> ) on an annuity shown above is used to calculate the number of periods based on the future value, rate, and periodic cash flows.</p>
<p>The formula at the top of the page, solving for n, generally approaches the question &quot;How long will it take to save  <b><i>$x</i></b>  amount dollars by saving  <b><i>$y</i></b>  per month at a rate of  <b><i>z%</i></b> ".</p>

<h2>Example of Solve for n on Annuity Formula</h2>
<p>Suppose that an individual receives an additional <i>$1000</i> pay or bonus semiannually. Suppose this individual would like to find out how long until they save <i>$19600</i> by saving <i>$1,000</i> every half year at an effective rate of <i>5%</i> every half year. **It is important to remember that the rate should match the frequency of the cash flows/payments. For example, if cash flows are semi-annual, then the effective semi-annual rate is used. The term effective implies that compounding is already adjusted for that period (see effective rate).</p>
<p>Using the formula at the top of the page to solve for the number of periods, <i>n</i>, for this example would show the equation</p>
<br>

<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Solve%20for%20n%20-%20Annuity%20(FV)%202.gif'></div></div>

<p>The above equation can be reduced to</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Solve%20for%20n%20-%20Annuity%20(FV)%203.gif'></div></div>

<p>which results in 14 semi-annual periods.</p>
<p>*Note that this is for academic reasons only.<br> **See section labeled Alternative Method for an additional way of solving this example.</p>

<h2>How is the Solve for n on Annuity Formula Derived?</h2>
<p>Solving for the number of periods on an annuity requires first looking the future value of annuity formula.</p>
<br>

<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/FV%20of%20Annuity%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The number of periods can be found by rearranging the above formula to solve for <i>n</i>. The first step would be to multiply both sides by  <b><i>r/P</i></b> . Then we can add  <b><i>1</i></b>  to each side which all results in the following formula</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Solve%20for%20n%20-%20Annuity%20(FV)%204.gif'></div></div>

<br><p>From here it is seen that  <b><i>(1+r)</i></b> <sup>n</sup> is isolated on the right side of the equation. To solve for the exponent  <b><i>n</i></b>  requires multiplying both sides by  <b><i>ln</i></b>  and the equation directly above can be reduced to</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Solve%20for%20n%20-%20Annuity%20(FV)%205.gif'></div></div>

<br><p>Both sides of the equation above can be divided by  <b><i>ln(1+r)</i></b>  which would result in the formula at the top of the page, solving for <b> <i>n</i></b>.</p>

<h2>Alternative method to Solve for Number of Periods n</h2>
<p>Another method of solving for the number of periods ( <b><i>n</i></b> ) on an annuity based on future value is to use a future value of annuity (or increasing annuity) table. Solving for the number of periods can be achieved by dividing  <b><i>FV/P</i></b> , the future value divided by the payment. This result can be found in the "middle section" of the table matched with the rate to find the number of periods, n.</p>
<p>For example, using the example provided in the preceding section, the future value of <i>$19600 </i>can be divided by semi-annual cash flows of <i>$1,000</i> which results in <i>19.6</i>. Using the future value of annuity table, one can see that at an effective rate of <i>5%</i>, <i>19.6</i> in the table matches up to <i>14</i> (semi-annual) periods.</p>
