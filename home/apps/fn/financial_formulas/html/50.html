<h1>Dividend Payout Ratio</h1>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Dividend%20Payout%20Ratio%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The dividend payout ratio is the amount of dividends paid to stockholders relative to the amount of total net income of a company. The amount that is not paid out in dividends to stockholders is held by the company for growth. The amount that is kept by the company is called retained earnings.</p>
<p>Net income shown in the formula can be found on the company&#39;s income statement.</p>
<p>This formula is used by some when considering whether to invest in a profitable company that pays out dividends versus a profitable company that has high growth potential. In other words, this formula takes into consideration steady income versus reinvestment for possible future earnings, assuming the company has a net income.</p>

<h2>Alternative Formula</h2>
<p>I.</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Dividend%20Payout%20Ratio%202.gif'></div></div>

<p>The retention ratio and the dividend payout ratio together equal 1 or 100% of net income. The premise is that whatever amount not paid in dividends is kept by the company to reinvest for expansion.</p>
<p>A simple example would be a company who pays out 100% of their net income in dividends. In this situation, net income would be equal to dividends. Using the formula for this example, the dividend payout ratio would be 1 or 100%. The retention ratio would be 0 or 0% as they do not retain and reinvest any of their earnings for growth. Using the alternative formula 1 - 0 would be 1.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a company who pays no dividends would have a 0 dividend payout ratio and a 1 retention ratio, which means that the company reinvests all of their net income for growth.</p>
<p>II.</p>

<p>The dividend payout ratio formula can also be restated on a &quot;per share&quot; basis. If the dividend per share and earnings per share is known, the dividend payout ratio can be calculated using the same concept of dividends paid divided by earnings, or net income.</p>
