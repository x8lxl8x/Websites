<h1>Dividend Yield (Stock)</h1>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/Dividend%20Yield%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The formula for the dividend yield is used to calculate the percentage return on a stock based solely on dividends. The total return on a stock is the combination of dividends and appreciation of a stock.</p>
<p>The dividends paid for a company can be found on the statement of retained earnings, which can then be used to calculate dividends per share.</p>

<h2>Use of Dividend Yield Formula</h2>
<p>The dividend yield formula can be used by investors who are looking for increasing or declining trends of the dividend yield. On a broader level, a company that is paying less in dividends relative to its price may be having problems or it could be retaining more of a percentage of its net income for growth. When evaluating a stock, it is important to consider the overall company and how much net income it is retaining as reinvesting its net income could lead to growth and an appreciation of the stock price.</p>
<p>The formula for dividend yield may be of greater interest to investors who rely on dividends from their investments. However, a lower dividend yield does not imply lower dividends as the price could have substantially increased. As stated before, a trend of a declining dividend yield should only warrant investigation and not an immediate dismissal of the investment.</p>

<h2>Example of Dividend Yield Formula</h2>
<p>An example of the dividend yield formula would be a stock that has paid total annual dividends per share of $1.12. The original stock price for the year was $28. If an individual investor wants to calculate their return on the stock based on dividends earned, he or she would divide $1.12 by $28. Using the formula for this example, the dividend yield would be 4%.</p>
