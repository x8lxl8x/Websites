<h1>Present Value of Growing Annuity</h1>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/PV%20of%20Growing%20Annuity%201.gif'></div></div>

<p>The present value of a growing annuity formula calculates the present day value of a series of future periodic payments that grow at a proportionate rate. A growing annuity may sometimes be referred to as an increasing annuity. A simple example of a growing annuity would be an individual who receives $100 the first year and successive payments increase by 10% per year for a total of three years. This would be a receipt of $100, $110, and $121, respectively.</p>
<p>The present value of a growing annuity formula relies on the concept of time value of money. The premise to this concept is that a specific quantity of money is worth more today than at a future time.</p>
<p>Like all financial formulas that involve a rate, it is important to correlate the rate per period to the number of periods in the present value of a growing annuity formula. If the payments are monthly, then the rate would need to be the monthly rate.</p>

<h2>How is the Present Value of a Growing Annuity Derived?</h2>
<p>The present value of a growing annuity is the sum of future cash flows. For a growing annuity, each cash flow increases at a certain rate. The formula for the present value of a growing annuity can be written as</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/PV%20of%20Growing%20Annuity%202.gif'></div></div>

<p>This formula is the general formula for summing the discounted future cash flows along with using  <b><i>1 + g</i></b>  to factor in that each future cash flow will increase at a specific rate.</p>
<p>This present value of a growing annuity formula can then be rewritten as</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/PV%20of%20Growing%20Annuity%203.gif'></div></div>

<p>This would be considered a geometric series where  <b><i>(1+g)/(1+r)</i></b>  is the common ratio. By using the geometric series formula, the present value of a growing annuity will be shown as</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/PV%20of%20Growing%20Annuity%204.gif'></div></div>

<p>This formula can be simplified by multiplying it by  <b><i>(1+r)/(1+r)</i></b> , which is to multiply it by 1. This cancels out many of these throughout the formula, which leaves</p>


<div class='clOverflow'><div class='clImage'><img src='../images/PV%20of%20Growing%20Annuity%205.gif'></div></div>

<p>In the denominator,  <b><i>(1+r) - (1+g)</i></b>  will return  <b><i>r-g</i></b> . At this point,  <b><i>P</i></b>  and  <b><i>r-g</i></b>  can be factored out, which will lead to the present value of a growing annuity formula shown at the top of the page.</p>
