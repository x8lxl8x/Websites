<h1>Time Value &amp; Intrinsic Value</h1>

<p>An option's premium, the amount you pay, can be
broken down into two component parts: <i>time value</i>
and <i>intrinsic value</i>.&nbsp; It is important to know how
to break an option's price into these two components as
well as understand the interpretation if you want to
become better at trading options.</p>
<h2>In-the-money versus out-of-the-money</h2>
<p>Before you can break an option's premium into time
and intrinsic values, you need to understand the terms
in-the-money and out-of-the-money, also called the <i>
moneyness</i> of an option.&nbsp; </p>
<p>An option is in-the-money if the stock price is
higher than the strike for calls and lower than the
strike for puts.&nbsp; If a stock is trading for $100, a $90
call is in-the-money and a $90 put is out-of-the-money.&nbsp;
The following chart may help:</p>

<p align='center'><b>Stock price BELOW strike</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>Out-of-the-money</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>In-the-money</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>An option that is exactly at the strike price is said
to be <i>at-the-money</i>.&nbsp; Now, it's rare to find a
stock trading exactly at the strike price, so it is
customary to call the nearest strike (whether in or
out-of-the-money) the at-the-money strike.&nbsp; For example,
if a stock were trading at $99-1/2, most traders would
consider the $100 strike at-the-money even though the
strike is slightly out-of-the-money.&nbsp; Likewise, if the
stock were slightly higher, say $100-1/4, most would
call the $100 strike at-the-money even though it is
slightly in-the-money.</p>
<h2>Intrinsic value</h2>
<p>If an option is in-the-money, it is said to have <i>
intrinsic value</i>.&nbsp; This is the value of the option if
you were to immediately exercise -- the difference
between the stock price and the strike.&nbsp; For example, if
the stock is trading for $101 and you hold the $100
call, you could realize a $1 point gain by exercising
the call option; you would receive stock worth $101, but
pay only $100*.</p>
<p>*<i>Generally a trader should never exercise a call
option early.&nbsp; Please see our section on &quot;Early
Exercise&quot; for more information.&nbsp; The value you could
gain by exercising early is purely a definition of
intrinsic value.</i></p>
<p>Another way to view intrinsic value is to calculate
the value of the option if it were to expire
immediately.&nbsp; Using the above example, if the $100 call
option expired, it would be worth $1, the same value as
if you exercised early.&nbsp; Why will it be worth $1?&nbsp; If it
is trading for less than that, say $1/2, arbitrageurs
will correct for it by buying the option for $1/2 and
selling the stock for $101, for a net credit of
$100-1/2. &nbsp;By immediately exercising, they can cover the
short position by paying only $100, the strike, for an
arbitrage profit of $1/2.&nbsp; This would continue until the
option is priced at a minimum of $1 (please see our
section under &quot;Basic Option Pricing&quot; in week five).</p>
<p>For puts, the idea of intrinsic value is the same but
in the other direction.&nbsp; If the stock were trading for
$99, the $100 put would have an intrinsic value of $1.&nbsp;
The holder of the put could exercise and sell stock
worth $99 but receive $100 -- a $1 gain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, if the put option expired immediately, it would
be worth $1.&nbsp; If it is worth less than this, say $1/2,
arbitrageurs will buy the put for $1/2 and buy the stock
for $99, for a total purchase price of $99-1/2.&nbsp; Then
they would immediately exercise it, sell the stock for
$100, and capture a $1/2 arbitrage profit.&nbsp; This would
continue until the option is priced at a minimum of $1.</p>
<p>Probably the easiest way to understand intrinsic
value is to think of it as the number of points the
stock is in your favor in relation to the strike price.&nbsp;
For example, if you are long a call, you are bullish and
want the stock to go up.&nbsp; If you have the $100 strike
call with the stock at $103, then your option is 3
points in-the-money; the stock is trading $3 points to
the bullish side (above) of your option.&nbsp; If you are
long the $105 put, you are bearish and want the stock to
fall.&nbsp; With the stock at $103, the stock is two points
to the bearish side (below) of your strike.</p>
<h2>Time value</h2>
<p>Time value (or time premium) is easy to calculate.&nbsp;
It's what is left over after accounting for intrinsic
value.&nbsp; Assume a $100 call is trading for a premium of
$3.&nbsp; If the stock is trading for $101 then the $100 call
has intrinsic value of $1; the remaining $2 is called
time premium.&nbsp; The following formula may help:</p>
<h2>Premium - intrinsic value = time value </h2>
<p>What if the stock were trading at $100?&nbsp; Now, the
$100 call is at-the-money and has no intrinsic value.&nbsp;
With the option trading for $3, the entire premium is
all time premium. &nbsp;This would be true for any stock
price at or below $100; the option would be comprised
entirely of time premium.</p>
<p>For puts, let's assume the stock is $98 and you are
holding the $100 put, which is trading for $5.&nbsp; The
option has $2 intrinsic value and therefore has $3 time
value.</p>

<h2>How much time premium do options have?</h2>
<p>Generally there will always be some time premium on
an option, even if only a small amount.&nbsp; With all else
constant, the longer the maturity of the option or the
more volatile the option, the more you will pay in time
premium.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; With all else constant, investors will
prefer to buy longer-term options, as they will have
more time for it to gain intrinsic value.&nbsp; Likewise,
investors will prefer more volatile options, as they
have a greater chance of making bigger moves, thereby
giving the option more intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Also, the deeper-in-the-money you go, the more time
premium will decrease.&nbsp; So if the stock is $100, the $80
call will have less time premium than the $85 call, and
the $85 will have less than the $90, etc.&nbsp; If the option
is deep enough in the money, the time premium will equal
the risk-free rate.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If the stock is at $100 and
the $80 call is sufficiently in-the-money, investors can
buy the stock and sell the $80 call (covered call
position) thereby &quot;guaranteeing&quot; them $80 at
expiration.&nbsp; As with any guaranteed trade, the interest
rate will be the risk-free rate.&nbsp; Now, it should be
mentioned that a covered call is never truly guaranteed,
as it is always possible for the stock to fall below the
strike price of the short call.&nbsp; However, if it is
sufficiently deep-in-the-money where the markets <i>
perceive</i> it to be guaranteed, then the market will
only reward you the risk-free rate for that trade.&nbsp; The
important point to understand is that as you move to
lower and lower strikes for calls (higher strikes for
puts), they become more and more likely to have
intrinsic value.&nbsp; Because of this, they will have
correspondingly lower amounts of time premium.</p>
<h2>Parity</h2>
<p>If there is no time premium on an option, it is said
to be trading at <i>parity</i>.&nbsp; For example, with the
stock at $103, a $100 call trading for $3 would be
trading at parity; there is no time premium on this
option.&nbsp; Usually, the only time you will see an option
trading at parity is at expiration with options that are
fairly deep-in-the-money.</p>
<h2>How do i use this information to trade?</h2>
<p>We said earlier that it is important to understand
time value and intrinsic value in order to understand
what you're getting into with a particular option.&nbsp; Any
option that has high time premium is risky (in trading
terms, it will have a high gamma value).&nbsp; The reason it
is risky is because the underlying stock must move, in
the proper direction, enough to make up for the time
premium.&nbsp; If it does not, you will end up with a losing
trade. </p>
<p>For example, if you buy a $100 call option for $10
with the stock at $100, the stock must get to $110
(stock price plus time premium) in order to break even.&nbsp;
If the stock moves to $108 at expiration, the $100 call
will be worth $8, yet you paid $10 for a $2 loss.</p>
<p>Now compare this to the trader who may have purchased
the $80 call, which may have been trading for $21 ($20
intrinsic + $1 time premium).&nbsp; With the stock at $110 at
expiration, the $80 call will be worth $30.&nbsp; This trader
bought for $21 and sold for $30 -- a profit of $9, which
is certainly different from the $2 loss taken with the
$100 call (for more on this, please see &quot;Deltas and
Gammas&quot; during week 5).</p>
<p>If you are looking for very quick moves in the
underlying, you can afford to buy options with higher
time premium.&nbsp; However, if you are only interested in
speculating on the direction of the underlying stock,
you should consider deeper-in-the-money options to avoid
the high risk associated with high time premium options.</p>
<p>But avoiding the speed game is not for free.&nbsp; If you
buy a deep-in-the-money option, you will pay more in
total dollars (more intrinsic value and less time
value).&nbsp; By doing so, you now have more money at risk if
the stock should move against you.&nbsp; In addition, if the
stock should fall, the deep-in-the-money option will
fall nearly point-for-point through a certain range of
stock prices before slowing.&nbsp; It is a delicate balancing
act to find the appropriate option that suits your
needs.</p>
<h2>Option trading mistakes</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes new option traders make
is to buy an option just because it is &quot;cheap.&quot;&nbsp; The
inexperienced trader will usually look to
out-of-the-money options because they can buy more
contracts for a fixed dollar investment, or similarly,
pay less money for a given number of contracts.&nbsp; For
example, if a stock is trading at $50, a new trader who
is bullish on the stock will usually look at a $55
strike or higher.&nbsp; They often wonder why one should buy
an in-the-money option as the stock has already exceeded
the strike price. &nbsp;They feel they are &quot;wasting&quot; money by
paying for the intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Usually cheap options are composed entirely of time
premium and can also be far-out-of-the-money.&nbsp; Make sure
you know where your break-even points are and that it
matches your sentiment with the underlying.&nbsp; For
example, if the stock is $100 and you want to buy the
$115 option for $2, that stock will have to move to $117
by expiration in order to break even on the trade.&nbsp; If
you do not think this is likely, you should probably
consider another option.&nbsp; A deeper-in-the-money option
will be more costly but have less time premium; it will
not need to move as far to break even.</p>
<p>Many strategies rely on the behavior of time
premium.&nbsp; If you plan to increase your trading knowledge
of options, you need to have a solid understanding of
time and intrinsic values.</p>
