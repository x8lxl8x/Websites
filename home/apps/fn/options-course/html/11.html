<h1>Open Interest</h1>

<p>You will often hear the term &quot;open interest&quot; in
option trading.&nbsp; It can be very helpful to understand
what this means, and how the number is either increased
or decreased.</p>
<p>Because of the way options are traded, the Options
Clearing Corporation (OCC) must account for the total
number of outstanding contracts.&nbsp; To do so, one could
either tally all long positions <u>or</u> all short
positions and get the total number of outstanding
contracts.&nbsp; This is because each contract has a buyer
and a seller (a long and a short position).&nbsp; Some people
mistakenly believe that the open interest is the total
number of long <u>and</u> short positions.&nbsp; However,
this would double count the actual number of open
contracts.</p>
<p>For example, say there are currently no contracts at
all trading on a particular stock.&nbsp; If Larry decides to
buy 10 contracts, he must find someone who is willing to
sell 10 contracts.&nbsp; If Moe would like to sell them, then
a buyer and seller can be matched and the total open
interest is now 10 contracts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice how open interest is <u>not</u> the total long
and short positions.&nbsp; If we count all longs and shorts
using the above example, we have 10 contracts long and
10 short, which give us a total of 20 -- exactly double
the correct answer.</p>
<p>Now say another trader, Curly, wants to buy 10
contracts.&nbsp; If he &quot;buys to open&quot; and Larry &quot;sells to
close,&quot; then, in effect, all that has happened is that
Larry and Curly have switched places and there are still
only 10 contracts outstanding.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because Larry
originally &quot;bought to open&quot; and then &quot;sold to close,&quot; so
he's out of the picture altogether.&nbsp; Now Moe and Curly
are effectively matched.</p>
<p><b>Whenever one party is opening a position and the
other party is closing a position, open interest remains
unchanged.</b></p>
<p>Should Moe be concerned that Larry is not on the
other side of the trade anymore?&nbsp; No, because
technically, OCC acts as a middleman and is the buyer to
every seller and the seller to every buyer.&nbsp; The trades
are all guaranteed (for contract performance, not
profit!) by the OCC.</p>
<p>Let's say Larry wants back in the action and &quot;buys to
open,&quot; but this time, another trader &quot;sells to open.&quot;&nbsp;
Assuming this trade was also for 10 contracts, the total
open interest is now 20 contracts.</p>
<p><b>Whenever <u>both</u> parties are opening
positions, open interest will increase by the amount of
the contracts traded.</b></p>
<p>In the above example, Moe and Curly have open
positions and are accounting for 10 of the 20 contracts
in open interest.&nbsp; If Moe &quot;buys to close&quot; and Curly
&quot;sells to close,&quot; the total open interest will fall to
10.</p>
<p><b>Whenever both parties are closing, open interest
will decrease by the amount of the contracts.</b></p>
<p>New traders are often confused with situations
similar to this:&nbsp; Say a new trader &quot;buys to open&quot; 10
contracts on an option that has no other volume for the
day, and the option had 100 open interest yesterday.&nbsp;
The next day, open interest still shows 100.&nbsp; The new
trader often thinks that a mistake has been made because
they &quot;bought to open&quot; 10 contracts, so the open interest
must surely be 110 now.&nbsp; Hopefully it is evident to you
now why this may happen -- the other side of the
transaction must have been &quot;selling to close&quot; keeping
the open interest unchanged.</p>
<h2>How to read the open interest numbers</h2>
<p>The open interest figures for a particular contract
are counted as round lots of 100 -- just like the option
contracts.&nbsp; So if you see open interest of 250, this
really means that a total of 250 *100 (or the equivalent
of 25,000 shares) is being traded in this option.</p>
<p>This is important to understand for trading purposes,
especially if you are placing large dollar amounts in a
particular option.&nbsp; Say an option shows 3,500 contracts
open interest (or a total of 350,000 shares) being
represented.&nbsp; On the surface, there appears to be a lot
of liquidity in this option.&nbsp; However, a better method
is to take the 350,000 shares and multiply it by the
market price of the option.&nbsp; Whether you use the bid,
ask, or last trade usually won't make a huge difference
unless there is a very high bid-ask spread.&nbsp; Let's say
the last trade was 1/8.&nbsp; In terms of total dollars in
the contract, that's only $43,700, which by market
standards, is not too liquid.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) is currently
trading around 3,320 with the Nov $3,350 call trading
about $186 (yes, this index is extremely expensive due
to the volatility!).&nbsp; There are &quot;only&quot; 558 open
interest, which doesn't appear to be too liquid.&nbsp; But if
we take 558 * 100 * $186, we see there is over
$10,000,000 in liquidity. </p>
<p>Before you place relatively large option orders,
check the liquidity by calculating the <i>total dollars</i>
in open interest in that option.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>You are bullish on MRVC trading around $38-1/2.&nbsp; You
want to &quot;buy to open&quot; 30 contracts of the Dec $30.&nbsp; Are
there potential liquidity problems?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Checking open interest we see there are only 8
contracts for a total of 800 shares represented by this
contract.&nbsp; The price is $12-1/4, which is 800 * $12-1/4
= $9,800 dollars being represented.&nbsp; This appears to be
a potential liquidity problem at this point.&nbsp; This is
not to say that things cannot change as December
expiration approaches, as they certainly can.&nbsp; However,
it is important to make your decisions with all
available relevant information.&nbsp; Would you feel
comfortable with a trade this large and only $9,800
worth of liquidity?</p>
<p>If not, it may be best to spread your risk through
other strikes or expirations.</p>
