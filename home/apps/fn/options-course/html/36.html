<h1>Selling Options On Expiration Day </h1>

<p>If you are an avid options trader, you may have
noticed that in-the-money calls and puts will often
trade for less than the intrinsic amount (the difference
between the stock price and the strike) on, or near,
expiration day.&nbsp; This is especially true for
deep-in-the-money options.&nbsp; For example, today is
February 16th (option expiration day), and Juniper
Networks (JNPR) is trading for $83-5/8.&nbsp; You would think
the Feb $70 call would be trading at parity -- exactly
intrinsic -- and be quoted at $13-5/8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, it is currently quoted at $12-3/8 on the
bid.&nbsp; Many investors accept this as normal functioning
of the market and will sell their options to close below
intrinsic value.&nbsp; For example, say you hold 10 of the
above JNPR Feb $70 calls and want to sell them.&nbsp; You
could sell at the bid and receive $12-3/8 * 10 * 100 =
$12,375.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there a better way?&nbsp; Yes!</p>
<p>If you read our section on &quot;Basic Option Pricing,&quot;
you may recall that, in theory, an option cannot trade
for less than intrinsic.&nbsp; The theory says that if an
option does trade below intrinsic, arbitrageurs will
sell the stock and buy the call for a guaranteed
profit.&nbsp; This buying and selling pressure will continue
until intrinsic value is restored.</p>
<p>So how do you trade your in-the-money option that is
trading below parity?&nbsp; The same way the arbitrageurs
would.</p>

</table>
<p>The stock is currently $83-11/16 on the bid.&nbsp; So you
place an order to sell 1,000 shares at $83-11/6.&nbsp; Now it
doesn't matter if you have the stock or not.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Once
the sell order is executed, you simply submit exercise
instructions to your broker and buy 1,000 shares at
$70.&nbsp; You received $83-11/16, but paid $70 to deliver
the shares.&nbsp; Your proceeds are $13-11/16 * 10 * 100 =
$13,687, for a difference of $1,312!&nbsp; Now, your broker
will charge you an extra commission to sell the stock,
but I think you can see it can be well worth it.</p>
<p>There is one important note to make here.&nbsp; There are
people, brokers included, who will tell you to &quot;short&quot;
the stock, instead of a regular sell order, and then
exercise the call.&nbsp; However, shorting the stock subjects
you to unnecessary risk and can be more costly.&nbsp; How?&nbsp;
If you short the stock you must have an uptick, and
there is never a guarantee of this.&nbsp; So it is possible
you may never get the stock sold!&nbsp; In addition, if you
short the stock, you will be subjected to a 50% Reg T
charge and may not earn interest on that amount while
waiting for settlement of the exercise (3 business
days).</p>
<p>The regulations always allow you to sell shares
(without it being a &quot;short sale&quot;) that are not held in
your account.&nbsp; Many investors keep shares in safe
deposit boxes and deliver the shares within the
three-day settlement period.&nbsp; This is perfectly
acceptable.&nbsp; Now, it's possible your <i>firm</i> does
not allow shares to be sold that are not in the
account.&nbsp; Sometimes the deep-discount brokers have
restrictions like this because they spend too much time
chasing down people to deliver the shares they promised
to deliver, and do not generate the revenues to make it
worth their while.&nbsp; Further, it costs the firm money to
file extensions in the event the shares are not
delivered.&nbsp; However, even if your firm requires the
shares to be in the account in order to be sold, let
your broker know that your are immediately submitting
exercise instructions to purchase the shares.&nbsp; There is
no reason they shouldn't allow it; the Options Clearing
Corporation (OCC) guarantees delivery of the shares at
settlement.</p>
<p>Once you <u>sell</u> the stock, immediately submit
exercise instructions.&nbsp; It is very important to submit
your exercise instructions on the <u>same day</u>,
otherwise the sale of stock and purchase from the option
exercise will not have matching settlement dates.&nbsp; While
this is not a major problem (it's not going to cause you
to lose the sale or anything), it's something your
broker does not want you to make a habit of.&nbsp; I won't go
into the details, but as long as you submit your
exercise instructions on the same day you sell the
stock, you will be fine.</p>
<p>What about put options?&nbsp; Assume the JNPR Feb $100
puts are trading for $15-7/8 on the bid.&nbsp; If you sell 10
contracts, you'll receive $15,875.&nbsp; But with the stock
trading at $83-3/4 on the ask, we see they are below
intrinsic and &quot;should be&quot; priced for $100 - $83-3/4 =
$16-1/4. </p>
<table cellPadding='14' border='0' id='table5'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>If your put options are trading below
intrinsic value, simply buy the stock, then
exercise your put.&nbsp;</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So you would pay $83-3/4 to buy the stock and receive
$100 from the exercise of the put, leaving you with the
intrinsic amount of $16-1/4 or $16,250 -- a difference
of $375 when compared to the trader who just sold the
puts at the bid price of $15-7/8.&nbsp; Again, the extra
commission will be well worth it.</p>
<p>In fact, years ago, there used to be an order called
&quot;exercise and cover&quot; meaning that the broker would sell
the stock and cover the sale by exercising the call (or
buy the stock and exercise the put).&nbsp; With the increased
liquidity in the options markets, this order has
disappeared although there are certainly times it could
still be used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Why will options trade below intrinsic?&nbsp; There are a
number of reasons, but the overall reason is that the
market makers are having a difficult time spreading off
the risk with the current liquidity.</p>
<p>For example, as discussed earlier, the Feb $70 calls
are trading for $12-3/8 but &quot;should be&quot; trading for
$13-5/8.&nbsp; This is strictly a result from having more
seller than buyers.&nbsp; Everybody wants to sell their calls
and nobody wants to buy; the new equilibrium price is
$12-3/8, which is below the theoretical value.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may be wondering why nobody is buying the calls
and selling the stock to restore the equilibrium.&nbsp; The
answer is, they are.&nbsp; Market makers are buying at
$12-3/8, then selling the stock.&nbsp; However, there's just
not enough volume or interest to bring it to
equilibrium.&nbsp; In the meantime, the stock continues to
fall, so by the time they short the stock, they may be
in for a loss (even though market makers are immune to
the &quot;uptick&quot; rule).&nbsp; With a bid at $12-3/8, they feel
that is worth the risk while awaiting executions.</p>
<p>What about retail investors?&nbsp; Why don't they join in
and buy the call and sell the stock?&nbsp; They can.&nbsp;
However, they must purchase the call on the ask at
$13-5/8 and sell the stock at the bid of $83-5/8,
leaving zero room for error!&nbsp; If you sell stock at
$83-5/8 and buy the $70 call, you will have a net credit
of $13-5/8, which is exactly what it will cost you to
buy the call.</p>
<p>Now, you may think to compete with the market makers
and try to notch up the bid price a bit.&nbsp; In other
words, if you bid $12-5/8, you will now be the highest
bidder and the quote will move to $12-5/8 on the bid and
$13-5/8 on the ask.&nbsp; If you purchase the call for
$12-5/8, you could certainly sell the stock and make
money.&nbsp; But here's the catch:&nbsp; if you bid at $12-5/8,
the market makers will bid $12-3/4, giving them a call
option for 1/8th!&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Market makers would love to buy
the call option below the &quot;fair value&quot; and hold an asset
that will behave just like the underlying stock.&nbsp; But if
the stock falls, the market maker will sell it back to
you at $12-5/8 and be out 1/8ths of a point.&nbsp; In other
words, they will use your buy order as a guaranteed stop
order.&nbsp; If they buy it for $12-3/4 and it doesn't work
out, they know they have a buyer at $12-5/8 -- you!&nbsp;
This is called &quot;leaning on the book&quot; and is a common
practice among market makers.</p>
<p>Just because the market is offering you a price below
the fair value, this doesn't mean you must accept it.&nbsp;
