<h1>Percent To Double</h1>

<p>Investors are constantly coming up with tools to find
the ideal option trade.&nbsp; In essence, they are looking
for ways to beat the market.&nbsp; Of course, many businesses
are willing to sell those products to them, and one of
the most pointless is the analytic tool called &quot;percent
to double&quot; (there is a similar indicator called
price-to-double which is the same information, just
expressed in prices and not percentages).&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'll show you the basic idea of percent to double and
you will immediately see why it's of no value.&nbsp; Be wary
of brokers who tell you they add value to your option
trades because they have access to percent-to-double
values.</p>
<p>Here is the idea behind percent-to-double.&nbsp; Say a
stock is trading for $100 and a $100 call option is
trading for $5.&nbsp; Percent-to-double is supposed to tell
you what percent the underlying stock needs to move in
order for the option price to double.&nbsp; For example, a
broker may tell you an option has a percent-to-double of
20%.&nbsp; This means that if the stock moves up 20%, the
call price will double from its current price.</p>
<p>On the surface, it sounds like it may be of value
since a lot of option traders will close positions when
they double their money.&nbsp; So it would be nice to know
just how much the stock needs to move in order to reach
that point.</p>
<p><b>Here's why it does not work.</b>&nbsp; Say the above
$100 call is priced at $5 with delta of 1/2.&nbsp; In order
for the option to double, it would have to be trading
for $10.&nbsp; Now, how many points does the stock need to
move to create a 5-point move in the option?&nbsp; With a
delta of 1/2, it may seem that the stock would have to
move 10 points.&nbsp; However, delta is accurate for sudden,
small changes in the stock price.&nbsp; If this stock were to
move 10 points, you can be assured the delta will no
longer be 1/2; it will be something much higher.&nbsp; So
dividing the number of point movement required in the
stock by delta will not work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Further, we need to know <i>how long</i> it will take
the stock to move.&nbsp; If you are told your option has a
percent-to-double of 20%, we really need to know over
what time period.&nbsp; Does that mean the stock must move
20% immediately, sometime today, next week or next
month?&nbsp; <i>Every single moment in time will produce a
different percent-to-double figure</i>.&nbsp; To complicate
that even more, you have implied volatilities that are
constantly changing, too.&nbsp; If the stock does move that
high but implied volatility drops, your option will not
double.</p>
<p>Another problem is that as the stock moves higher and
the option becomes more in-the-money, the bid-ask
spreads become very wide.&nbsp; So even if percent-to-double
forecasted correctly, it would be in reference to the
asking price and not the bid price, which is what you
will receive for selling the option.</p>
<p>If you are still not convinced, use percent-to-double
for your next hundred or so option trades -- you will
not see one time that it forecasts correctly.&nbsp; There are
just too many variables that affect the option's price.</p>
<p>The only time percent-to-double will work is at
expiration.&nbsp; With the above $100 call trading at $5, we
do know that the call will double in price if the stock
closes at $110.&nbsp; With the stock at $110, the $100 call
will be trading for $10 (the intrinsic amount) --
exactly double the price.&nbsp; But notice that in order for
it to work, we had to wait until expiration -- and then
it is too late.</p>
<p>Even if percent-to-double did work, there is just no
value to the information.&nbsp; The markets already have that
information priced into the option.&nbsp; It may seem that a
percent-to-double of 1% is much better than 20%.&nbsp;
However, think about this example:&nbsp; Say there are two
stocks, A and B.&nbsp; Stock A is $100 and hardly moves, and
the $100 call is $1/2.&nbsp; Stock B is a high-flying tech
stock capable of moving several points in a day.&nbsp; It is
priced at $50 with the $50 call at $5.&nbsp; Stock A has an
at-expiration percent-to-double of 1%, and B has one of
20%.&nbsp; It should now be apparent why there is a
difference.&nbsp; Stock B is much more likely to move, so the
markets will bid it's option price up; that's why its
price is $5 while A's is only $1/2.&nbsp; You have no added
value by knowing the percent-to-double.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Unless you are familiar with option pricing, be
careful with software that tries to pick out the &quot;best&quot;
trades for you.&nbsp; Remember, the markets will always price
in the proper risk-reward ratios.&nbsp; Using some of these
tools can lead to a false sense of security and
disappointing trades. </p>
