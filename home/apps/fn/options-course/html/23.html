<h1>Basic Options Pricing</h1>

<p>In 1973, Fisher Black and Myron Scholes introduced
their landmark publication with a formula for
calculating the &quot;fair price&quot; of an option. It is
arguably the most significant publication in finance or
economics over the past fifty years or more. Myron
Scholes received the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his
contribution.</p>
<p>The reason it is so significant is because, prior to,
there was no way to fairly determine the price of an
option. In this case, buyers bid very low and sellers
offer very high. There becomes very little liquidity and
the market never gets off the ground. </p>
<p>This financial breakthrough led to the creation of
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) because prior
to, there was no way to fairly determine the price of an
option. Options were traded through the over-the-counter
market (OTC) on an unregulated basis and did not have to
adhere to the principle of &quot;fair and orderly markets.&quot;
Today, largely due to Black and Scholes, the CBOE trades
tens of millions of contracts per month.</p>
<p>Black and Scholes basically developed an &quot;options
calculator,&quot; known as the Black-Scholes Model, that will
tell you what a call should be worth if you know five
main factors (six if you include dividends): </p>
<p>1) Stock price<br>
2) Exercise or strike price<br>
3) Risk-free rate of interest<br>
4) Volatility of the underlying stock<br>
5) Time to expiration</p>
<p>The calculator is similar to a loan calculator that
will tell you what your payment should be if you know
the loan amount, time, interest rate and compounding
periods. Similarly, if you know the five factors in the
Black-Scholes Model, you can determine what the call
option should be worth.</p>
<h2>Trading without theoretical values </h2>
<p>The Black-Scholes Model is an invaluable tool for
floor traders and retail investors alike. However, there
are certain principle relationships that must remain
within the options markets, with or without the
Black-Scholes Model, otherwise arbitrage opportunities
will be available. This is where we will be focusing as,
if you know these relationships, it will greatly improve
your trading skills and knowledge of option pricing and
strategies.</p>
<h2>Option pricing relationships</h2>
<h2><u>Pricing Relationship #1:</u></h2>
<p><b>The Lower the strike, the higher the price of a
call option.</b></p>
<p>If you have two call options, one that is a $50 and
$55 strike with all other factors alike (i.e. same
underlying stock and time), the $50 will always be more
expensive than the $55. Why?</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to show this, and
whichever way is easiest to remember is fine -- just as
long as you understand it.</p>
<p>First, we can look at it from a probability
standpoint:</p>
<p>
<img width='300px'  src='../images/026.gif'>;-------No
Value ------<img width='300px'  src='../images/027.gif'>
<img width='300px'  src='../images/026.gif'>--------
Value ---------<img width='300px'  src='../images/027.gif'></p>
<p><b>$0 ------------------------------- $50
------------------------$100</b></p>
<p>Looking at the diagram above, say a stock can only
trade between $0 and $100 and you have the $50 strike
call. You have, in effect, a 50-50 chance of having
intrinsic value at expiration. If the stock is above
$50, your option will have some value; if it is below
$50, it will be worth nothing. So, how do we increase
our chances of having intrinsic value at expiration?
Simple -- we buy a call with a lower strike price.</p>
<p>
<img width='300px'  src='../images/026.gif'>No
Value<img width='300px'  src='../images/027.gif'>
<img width='300px'  src='../images/026.gif'>----------------
Value ------------------<img width='300px'  src='../images/027.gif'></p>
<p><b>$0 --------------$25
----------------------------------------------$100</b></p>
<p>For example, buying the $25 strike gives us far more
room to the right (intrinsic value) as compared to the
$50 strike. Thus, our chances are better of having some
value at expiration. The markets figure this out and
will accordingly bid the $25 strike higher than the $50.</p>
<p>The second method to show this relationship is simply
from a financial cash flow standpoint. Remember, the
option gives you the right to purchase the stock. Using
the example above, at expiration, assuming you did want
to buy the stock, would you rather pay $25 for it or
$50? Again, the markets realize this and will bid the
lower strikes above the higher strikes with all other
factors constant.</p>
<p>Okay, this may sound good in theory, but how do we
know that it will actually happen in the real world? Say
we quote two options one day and see the following
prices:</p>
<p><b>$50 call priced at $5<br>
$55 call priced at $6</b></p>
<p>What will happen? We found out above that the markets
should bid the $50 strike higher, but for some reason,
it is lower. If this were to happen in the real world,
traders known as arbitrageurs, will do the following
trades simultaneously:</p>
<p>Buy the $50 call: -$5<br>
Sell the $55 call: <u>+$6</u><br>
Net Credit +$1</p>
<p>They will receive a credit of $1 into their account.
If the stock collapses, both options expire worthless
and the arbitrageur will keep the $1. If the stock is
trading higher, say $70, then the $50 call will be worth
$20 and the $55 will be worth -$15 (remember, this call
was sold. It will be worth $15 to the person who bought
it) for a net credit of $6 ($5 for the difference in
calls plus the $1 credit from the initial trade). </p>
<p>This credit of $6 will be the result for any stock
price at $55 or higher. What if the stock is between $50
and $55? If the stock closes at $52, the $50 call is
worth $2, and the $55 expires worthless, leaving the
trader a credit of $3. So the worst that can happen is
the arbitrageur makes $1, and the best is that he makes
$6. Because there is a guaranteed profit with no cash
outlay, it is an arbitrage. Do not worry -- arbitrageurs
will guarantee that the lower strike calls will always
be worth more than the higher strikes! </p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Insights into option pricing: Why can't I
enter a buy-write for a net credit?</b><p>This
leads to some interesting insights about option
pricing. Theoretically, the optimal strike to
own would be a $0 strike price (these don't
exist, but just say they do). What should it be
worth? Well, the price of a call can <u>never</u>
exceed the price of the stock, otherwise -- you
guessed it -- arbitrage is possible. Say a $0
strike is trading for $51 with the stock at $50.
Arbitrageurs will buy the stock for $50 and sell
the $0 strike for $51 thus guaranteeing them a
$1 profit. </p>
<p>This is why buy-writes (orders where you
simultaneously buy the stock and write, or sell,
the call) can never be done at a credit. Now you
know why! The call option can never be worth
more than the stock.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For puts, the opposite relationship will hold for
exactly the opposite reasons listed above. Put options
will always be worth more with higher strikes with all
other factors the same. </p>
<p>As a practice, you may want to pull up option quotes
on your favorite stock and see if lower strike calls are
always worth more than the higher strikes and the
opposite for puts. </p>

</table>
<h2><u>Pricing Relationship #2:</u></h2>
<p><b>At expiration, a call must be worth either zero or
the difference between the stock price and the strike
price.</b></p>
<p>All this says is that a call must be worth intrinsic
value (the difference between the stock price and
strike) at expiration. If there is no intrinsic value,
it's price will be zero at expiration. </p>
<p>If the stock is trading at $57 at expiration, the $50
call must be worth exactly $7 (actually, in the real
world, bid/ask spreads will make it worth slightly
less). Why must an option always be worth intrinsic?</p>
<p>If it is not, an arbitrage opportunity is available.
Say the following quotes exist:</p>
<p>Stock trading at $57<br>
$50 call trading at $5</p>
<p>The arbitrageurs will realize the call is mispriced
and do the following trades simultaneously:</p>
<p>Short the stock: +57<br>
Buy the call: <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;-5</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+52</p>
<p>The arbitrageur will short the stock and buy the call
as above. Now all he has to do is cover the short. How
will he do this? Simple, he will use the option, which
gives him the right to buy at $50, and exercise it
immediately. Upon doing this, he will have received +$57
then spent $55 for a net of $2; exactly the amount the
call was mispriced. Because this is a guaranteed
transaction with no cash outlay, it is an arbitrage.</p>

<h2><u>Pricing Relationship #3:</u></h2>
<p><b>Prior to expiration, a call option must be worth
<u>at least</u> the difference between the stock price
and the present value of the exercise price.</b></p>
<p>This one is a little complicated, but still important
for many strategies. What this says is that for any call
option, the minimum price it must trade for is the cost
of carry. </p>
<p>Why? Think about this. Say a stock is trading for
$100 and your best friend came to you and said, &quot;I'm
getting a huge bonus in one year but really want to buy
1,000 shares of this stock now. Would you be willing to
buy it for me and I will pay you the $100,000 in one
year?&quot; </p>
<p>If you see your friend as risk-free, you should, at a
minimum, charge him $5,000 for your forgone interest.
That's all this relationship is stating. Of course, if
there is an element of risk, you should charge more than
$5 per contract. This leads to another important insight
of call options -- they are a form of borrowing money!</p>
<p>Let's look at this closely. If your friend owes you
$5 in one year, how much is it worth today? To answer
that, we need to know the present value of $5 owed in
one year at 5% interest. </p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table7'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>What does present value mean?</b><br>
The <i>present value</i> of money is simply the
value of a future cash flow today -- the value
at the present. It's really very easy. Say you
have $100 in a bank at 5% interest. In one year,
you would have $105, right? That's called the
future value of money -- it is a sum of money
today ($100) valued in the future ($105). Now,
present value just works backwards. If you are
owed $105 in one year, how much is it worth
today? Simple, just undo the above calculation
-- $105/1.05 = $100. We would say the present
value of $105 due in one year is $100 today if
interest rates are 5% and the investment is
risk-free. In other words, an investor should be
indifferent between $100 today or $105 due in
one year.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Because your friend is borrowing $5 for one year,
that amount is worth $5/1.05 = $4.76 today. Because your
principal, the $100, is being returned in one year, the
only thing you will be missing in one year is the $5
interest. So the call option, in this case, should sell
for at least $4.76. Why would it trade higher? If the
markets see the stock as risky, investors would rather
buy the option versus the stock to reduce their downside
risk. They will bid the option higher. So volatility
makes options -- both calls and puts -- more expensive.</p>
<p>Assume now that your friend wants to buy the stock
from you in a year but only wants to pay $80 even though
it's currently trading for $100. Now at the end of the
year, you will be out $5 in interest plus $20 in
principal for a total of $25 loss in one year. How much
is that worth today? Take the present value: $25/1.05 =
$23.81, and that's how much the $80 call must <u>at
least</u> trade for! Any price lower than this leads to
arbitrage.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the formula for this relationship can
also be written as:</p>
<p><b>Minimum call price = Stock price - Present value
of the strike price.</b></p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table8'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b>Examples:</b><p>Let's use the above
formula to calculate the minimum price of a call
instead of the intuitive method used earlier. If
the stock is trading at $100 and interest rates
are 5%, how much should the 1-year, $100 strike
call trade for?<br>
Stock price - present value of the strike price
=<br>
$100 - ($100/1.05) = $4.76</p>
<p>For the $80 strike call:<br>
$100 - ($80/1.05) = $23.81</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Why does this formula work? Remember, we said the
call should trade for at least the cost of carry. If the
stock is trading for $100 today, we can rewrite this
relationship as:</p>
<p>$100 stock price today = $100 exercise price/1.05 +
<b>$5 interest/1.05</b></p>
<p>In order to isolate the interest amount or cost of
carry (shown in bold), we can rewrite the formula as
$100 stock price - $100 exercise price/1.05 = cost of
carry, which is exactly the formula above. </p>
<p>If the call option does not trade for this minimum
amount, what will happen? This one is tricky to see, but
an arbitrage opportunity does exist. Here's how the
arbitrageurs will do it.</p>
<p>Say we see the following quotes:</p>
<p><b>Stock: $100<br>
$100 call: $3<br>
Time: 1-year option<br>
Interest rates: 5%</b></p>
<p>We have already determined that this call option
should be worth $4.76 yet we see it trading for $3. </p>
<p>Arbitrageurs will do the following trades
simultaneously:</p>
<p>Short 1000 shares of stock:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$100,000<br>
Buy the call:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;-$3,000</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$97,000</p>
<p>Now, the arbitrageurs will owe 1,000 share of stock
from the short sale. By purchasing the call, they will
always be able to buy back the stock for $100 if the
stock is trading higher. They will leave the $97,000 in
the money-market (or T-bills) and receive $101,850
($97,000 credit * 1.05). </p>
<p>The arbitrageur now has two choices depending on
where the stock is trading at the end of the year. If
the stock is above $100, they will just use the call
option, pay $100, and keep the $1,850 (difference
between the $101,850 received in interest and the
$100,000 that must be paid to cover the short position).
However, if the stock is trading below the strike price,
traders will just let the option expire worthless and
buy the stock in the open market, thus increasing the
profits further.</p>

<td><b>Insights into the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model</b><br>
The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, in a
simplified form, can be written as:<p>Stock
price *(risk factor<sub>1</sub>) - (present
value of the exercise price) *(risk factor<sub>2</sub>)<br>
Without the &quot;risk factors,&quot; you will see the
Black-Scholes formula is exactly the same as our
formula above. Black and Scholes are simply
saying that a call must be worth at least the
cost of carry plus an additional amount if risk
is present. It is the calculations of these risk
factors that won the Nobel Prize!</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2><u>Pricing Relationship #4:</u></h2>
<p><b>The more time to expiration, the greater the price
of calls and puts.</b></p>
<p>This relationship should be fairly obvious. The
longer the life of the option, the more you will pay for
it. The more time you have, the better your chances for
the option going in-the-money. The markets, knowing
this, will bid the longer-term options higher. This it
true for calls and puts.</p>
<p>Can we be assured this will happen in the real world?</p>
<p>Say we see the following quotes one day:</p>
<p><b>3-month $50 strike call = $5<br>
6-month $50 strike call = $4<br>
(with all other factors being the same)</b></p>
<p>What will happen?</p>
<p>Arbitrageurs will buy the 6-month and sell the 3
month for a net credit of $1. If the stock falls below
$50, the arbitrageur will keep the $1. What if the stock
is higher than $50 when the 3-month expires?</p>
<p>If the stock is trading at, say, $70 after 3-months,
the person who owns the 3 month call will exercise it
and buy the stock from us for $50. That's okay because
we'll just exercise our call and buy the stock for $50.
The reason we can exercise our call option early is
because equity options are American-style, which means
they can be exercised at any time*. We still keep our $1
and have not lost a thing.</p>
<p><b>*It is important to note that,
under normal circumstances, it is never optimal to
exercise a call option early except to capture a
dividend. However, to complete the arbitrage, we must
exercise early.</b></p>
<p>Here's a tricky question: What if these are European
style calls? European-style options can <u>only</u> be
exercised at expiration, not before as with
American-style calls.</p>
<p>If this is the case, and we are assigned on the
3-month call, we would have to buy stock in the open
market at $70 and sell it for $50. That's a loss of $20
to us although we still have our original $1 credit from
the original transaction. It may appear as though we are
faced with a $19 loss since we cannot exercise our call
option. </p>
<p>So what happens now? Are we stuck? No, and here's
why:</p>
<p>All we have to do is sell our call to close in the
open market. Remember, under Pricing Relationship #2,
the call must be worth at least the difference between
the stock price and exercise price; therefore our call
will be trading for at least $20 ($20 intrinsic value +
time premium). So selling our call in the open market,
we can complete the arbitrage!</p>
<h2>Pricing Relationship #5</h2>
<p><b>For any two options, the difference in price
cannot exceed the difference in strikes.</b></p>
<p>This relationship says that for any two call options,
the difference in their prices cannot be greater than
the difference in their strikes. An example will make
this easier. Say we see the following quotes one day:</p>
<p>$50 Call = $10<br>
$55 Call = $4<br>
(with all other factor constant)</p>
<p>We know from Pricing Relationship #1 that the $50
call should be worth more than the $55, and we see that
it is. However, Relationship #5 says that there cannot
be this much of a difference because the difference in
strikes is $5, yet the difference in price is $6. So the
difference in prices has exceeded the difference in
strikes.</p>
<p>How will the markets correct for this? You should
know by now that arbitrage is the answer! </p>
<p>Arbitrageurs will buy the $55 call and sell the $50
for a net credit of $6.</p>
<p>Buy $55 -$4<br>
Sell $50 <u>+$10</u><br>
Net credit +$6</p>
<p>If the stock collapses, the arbitrageur will keep $6.
This will be true for any stock price below $50. If the
stock close between $50 and $55, say $52, the trader
will lose $2 on the short $50 call, but still keep the
initial $6 for a net gain of $4.</p>
<p>The worst that can happen is for the stock to close
above $55, for the trader will be assigned on the $50
strike. We must then buy the stock at market and sell
for $50. Of course, we can always exercise our $55 call
to buy the stock, so no matter how high the stock moves,
the worst we can be hurt is by the amount of the spread,
in this case, $5. Because we made $6 initially, we will
end up with a credit of $1.</p>
<p>So the arbitrageur will make a minimum of $1 and a
maximum of $6.</p>
<p>An easier way to understand Pricing Relationship #5
is to view the two contracts as if they were money.
Imagine you are bidding on a foreign currency and can
buy any denomination of bills. If you bid for 100 Yen,
for example, you would never bid more than double that
amount for 200 Yen.</p>
<p>Likewise, options must obey the same principle. If
you think about it, there really is no difference in
owning a $50 call vs. a $55 call in terms of financial
liability. The person with the $50 strike can pay $50
for the stock; the person with the $55 strike can pay
$55. So the market will never give you more than the
difference in strikes.</p>
<p>The same will hold for put options too.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table10'>

<td><b>Insights into option prices</b><br>
Look at the call option quotes for your favorite
stock. Look very deep in-the-money. What is the
difference in asking prices? If you look deep
enough, it will be <u>exactly</u> the difference
in strikes and no more. If you look for the
at-the-money quotes, you will see they will be
less than the difference in strikes, usually
about half. The markets will not give you the
full value of the difference in strikes, because
at-the-money options involve more risk so the
markets will bid these spreads downward.
Finally, look for the far out-of-the-money
quotes. There will be virtually no differences
in the asking prices; their spreads have
collapsed to zero.
<p>Now you should have a basic understanding of
why this relationship is true for any option
quotes!</td>

<h2>How to easily figure your maximum gain on spreads</h2>
<p>Now that you understand some basics in option
pricing, you should be able to easily figure out the max
gain and loss for spreads! Say you buy a $50 call for $3
and sell a $55 call for $1. Think about it this way: the
maximum this spread could ever be worth is $5, right?
However, you paid $2 for it (paid $3 and sold for $1 for
a net of $2). So the maximum gain is $3 on this spread.
The maximum loss is the amount you paid, $2. See, it's
really not that hard once you understand why the prices
must hold. </p>
<p>These are just some of the most basic yet most
important relationships to understand about options. It
should be evident now, too, that market makers cannot
just &quot;throw any quote on the board they please&quot; as many
people will have you think. There is a very intricate
web of pricing relationships that cannot be broken
otherwise arbitrage opportunities will arise. </p>
<p>Understanding option pricing is a key element to
success in trading!</p>

<h2>Answers:</h2>
<p>Why is there an arbitrage opportunity in the
following quotes? How would you perform the arbitrage?
</p>
<p>$60 put = $12<br>
$70 put = $10<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an arbitrage opportunity because, all else
constant, a higher strike put will always be worth more
than a lower strike put. Because a put represents a cash
flow in to your account upon exercise, it is more
desirable to have a higher strike so it should trade for
a higher price.</p>
<p>To arbitrage:<br>
Buy $70 put -$10<br>
Sell $60 put <u>+$12</u><br>
Net cash +$2</p>
<p>If the stock collapses, you will make $10 from the
spread plus $2 from the original transaction for a total
of $12. If the stock flies to the upside, above $70,
both contracts become worthless and you keep the $2. If
the stock closes between $60 and $70, you will make
money on the $70 but the $60 will expire worthless. So
you will make at least $2 and possibly $12 from this
arbitrage.</p>
<h2>Question #2 </h2>
<p>Stock is trading for $100<br>
$110 put is trading for $9</p>
<p>Is there an arbitrage opportunity? How would you do
it?</p>
<p>Yes, an arbitrage opportunity exists because any
option, call or put, must trade for at least the
intrinsic amount. In this case, the put option is
trading for $9 but should be at least $10. </p>
<p>To arbitrage:<br>
Buy stock -$100<br>
Buy $110 put <u>-$9</u><br>
Net outlay -$109</p>
<p>Exercise the option and receive $110 for a net credit
of $1. This is the exact amount by which the option is
mispriced.</p>
