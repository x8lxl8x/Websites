<h1>Profit And Loss Diagrams</h1>

<p>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand
words.&nbsp; This is so true when it comes to profit and loss
diagrams on options.&nbsp; By looking at a picture, you can
immediately see where your max profit and loss is, feel
how the position will behave, and know where the danger
zones are for any strategy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are basically two types of
option investors.&nbsp; Those who can read profit and loss
diagrams, and those who can't!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Being able to read and understand the profit and loss
diagram is critical for understanding options.</p>
<p><b><i>Important Note:</i></b>&nbsp; Before we get started,
there is one very important point that needs to be made
here.&nbsp; When we speak of profit and loss diagrams, we are
talking about the profit and losses <i><u>at expiration
of the option.</u></i>&nbsp; Prior to expiration, it is very
difficult to say what the profit/loss diagrams will look
like because of the many factors that affect an option's
price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So what exactly is a profit and loss diagram?&nbsp; Let's
start with the simplest one -- a long stock position.</p>
<p>If you are long stock (meaning you own it), you will
make one point of profit for every point increase in the
stock above your cost basis.&nbsp; Likewise, for every point
drop below your cost, you will lose exactly one point.&nbsp;
This is easy to show on a spreadsheet.&nbsp; Assume we buy 1
share of stock at a price of $50:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>If the stock price is:</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Your profit/loss will be</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$45</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>-$5</td>

<p align='center'>$54</td>

<td v>
<p align='center'>$55</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>+$5</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Assuming you paid $50 for the stock, this table shows
that you will have a loss of $5 if the stock is trading
at $45.&nbsp; If the stock is trading for say, $53, you will
have a profit of $3 per share.&nbsp; If the stock is trading
for $50, you will have no profit and no loss -- you are
just breaking even.</p>
<p>You must admit, even though this is a relatively
simple position, it's not readily apparent as to the
behavior.&nbsp; So let's take the above numbers and put them
in a picture -- a profit and loss diagram.&nbsp; All we have
to do is plot the stock prices from the table above on
the horizontal axis (the x-axis) and the profit/loss
numbers on the vertical axis (the y-axis).&nbsp; Once we do,
we get the following picture:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/004.gif'>

<p>How do you read the chart?&nbsp; Using the chart below,
look at any stock price along the horizontal axis such
as $53, for example.&nbsp; Now trace a line to the
profit/loss line (blue) and see where that point lines
up with the vertical axis to the left.&nbsp; It lines up with
$3 profit, which is exactly what we calculated in the
spreadsheet previously.&nbsp; At a stock price of $46, we see
the profit/loss line shows a $4 loss.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/005.gif'>

<p>It should be evident that it is much easier to look
at the picture rather than the spreadsheet to see how a
long stock position, at $50, will behave.&nbsp; We know
immediately that the break-even point is at $50 -- the
point where the profit/loss line crosses zero on the
horizontal axis.&nbsp; We can also immediately see that there
is unlimited loss (at least all the way down to a stock
price of zero since you can never lose more than what
you paid) and an unlimited upside potential as the line
continues up to the right without bounds.</p>
<p>What if you are short the stock?&nbsp; Shorting stock
involves borrowing the shares and selling them with the
intent of buying them later at a cheaper price.&nbsp; You
are, in essence, doing the reverse of the traditional
&quot;buy low - sell high&quot; strategy.&nbsp; You are trying to &quot;sell
high - buy low.&quot;&nbsp; The profit and loss diagram for short
stock looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/006.gif'>

<p>A short position will always behave the opposite of
the corresponding long position.&nbsp; In this case, we see
that profit is made as the stock falls and unlimited
losses occur as the stock rises.&nbsp; The unlimited loss
part is what makes the short stock position so
dangerous!</p>
<p>Got the hang of it?&nbsp; Ok, let's try something a little
more complicated and see what a long call position looks
like.</p>
<h2>Long call position</h2>
<p>A long $50 call gives the owner the right, but not
the obligation to buy stock at a price of $50 over a
specified amount of time.&nbsp; The trader, in this case,
paid $3 per share for that right and, consequently, that
is all that can be lost.&nbsp; So, no matter how low the
stock falls, this trader's maximum loss is just the
premium of $3.&nbsp; </p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/007.gif'>

<p>Looking at the chart below, we see the call option
trader has, in effect, limited the downside risk below
$50, as compared to the long stock position, but still
retained all of the upside potential.&nbsp; Of course, this
does not come for free.&nbsp; If you notice, the break-even
has been moved upward by $3, the price of the call
option, to $53.&nbsp; This is the most powerful benefit of
options; they allow you to custom-tailor the profit/loss
profiles to exactly suit your needs.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/008.gif'>

<h2>Short Call</h2>
<p>Let's see what a short call looks like.&nbsp; Remember, we
said at the beginning that a short position would be
exactly the opposite of the corresponding long position.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table10'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/009.gif'>

<p>The profit/loss diagram for the short call (red line)
is telling us that the maximum profit is $3, the amount
of the premium.&nbsp; This will be made for any stock price
(at expiration) below $50.&nbsp; Because the $50 call will be
worthless to the owner (the long position) at
expiration, the short position will profit by the entire
premium of $3.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice how this short call is the mirror image of the
long call position (blue line).&nbsp; For the long call, $3
is the maximum loss; this is the amount of the short
call's maximum gain.&nbsp; The short call's break-even point
is at $53, because at this point at expiration, the
option will be trading for $3, (remember, this is the
profit for the long position).&nbsp; The short's position
will be worth -$3 and this is the amount for which the
call was sold for a net profit/loss of zero.&nbsp; If the
stock moves above $53, unlimited losses will occur for
the short call beyond this point.&nbsp; Because of the high
leveraged nature of options, the short call (also called
a naked or uncovered call) position is the riskiest of
all!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because you can only make a limited gain on
the position, but are assuming an unlimited risk to do
so.&nbsp; </p>
<p>An interesting point should be made here.&nbsp; Look again
at the above chart with the long call and short call
positions.&nbsp; Because they are mirror images of each
other, this shows that no <i>net </i>flow of cash is
created from the options markets.&nbsp; In other words, any
option trader's gain is exactly somebody else's loss;
the money merely changes hands.&nbsp; The financial press is
often known for making the statement that the options
markets should not exist for this very reason.&nbsp; This is
a big misconception.&nbsp; The options markets were created
as a way to hedge risk; it is a way for hedgers to meet
speculators.&nbsp; So the next time you hear about a
devastating loss due to derivatives, remember, the
trader/traders on the other side of the trade made
exactly that amount of a gain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Okay, let's work one backwards.&nbsp; I'll show you the
profit/loss chart and see if you can identify it:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table11'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/010.gif'>

<p>Look at the chart and try to read it:&nbsp; The trader in
the diagram can only lose $5, no matter how high the
stock goes.&nbsp; But, an unlimited amount (down to a zero
stock price) can be made if the stock falls below $50.&nbsp;
Which option position has these characteristics?</p>
<p>If you said a long $50 strike put, you're right!&nbsp; A
long put is a bearish position; you make money if the
stock falls (assuming it falls far enough to offset the
premium).&nbsp; A short stock position, as we saw earlier, is
bearish too.&nbsp; But, the long put position is not exposed
to the unlimited upside risk as the stock moves higher.&nbsp;
Again, this does not come for free.&nbsp; The long put
position, in this example, must have the stock fall
below $45 before money is made.&nbsp; The short stock
position will make money for <i>any</i> fall in the
stock below $50.</p>
<p>Okay, just to make sure you have it, let's look at a
short put, which remember, should be the mirror image of
the long put above.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table12'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/011.gif'>

<p>And we see that it is.&nbsp; It is easy to see from the
profit and loss diagram that a short put is bullish, as
maximum profit is made when the stock is above $50.&nbsp; The
trader is exposed to unlimited losses (down to a stock
price of zero).&nbsp; This short put position will break-even
at a stock price of $45, since the put will be worth -$5
at expiration, which is exactly the amount of the
premium collected.</p>
<h2>Combination Strategies</h2>
<p>The above strategies are relatively simple, but are
intended to teach you the basics in reading a profit and
loss diagram.&nbsp; Now we will get a little more complicated
and really see their value when we look at combination
strategies.&nbsp; These are strategies that combine two or
more positions to really custom tailor those risk-reward
profiles you may be seeking but were unable to do with
stock alone.</p>
<p>For starters, let's view the profit/loss diagram for
a covered call position, which is one of the most
popular strategies in options.&nbsp; The covered call is a
strategy in which the investor buys the stock and sells
(or writes) the call against that stock.&nbsp; The investor
will take in some money for doing so, which in effect,
provides a small downside hedge -- it lowers the
break-even point.&nbsp; However, the investor also gives up
some of the upside potential in the stock. </p>
<p>Let's piece the two positions together.&nbsp; Remember
that the profit/loss for long stock looks like this
(assuming that $50 is paid per share):</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table13'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/012.gif'>

<p>Now let's add the covered call.&nbsp; Say the investor
sells a $60 call against the stock for a premium of $5.&nbsp;
This means the investor will receive $5 per share but
may have to sell the stock at $60.&nbsp; On the surface, it
doesn't seem like a bad deal as you are getting paid to
sell your stock at a profit.&nbsp; As we will soon see, with
the help of our profit/loss diagram, there is a price to
pay.</p>
<p>By selling the $60 call, the investor &quot;gives up&quot; any
appreciation in the stock above $60; he has sold those
rights to somebody else -- the person who bought the
call.&nbsp; But the investor also reduces the downside risk,
slightly, in exchange.&nbsp; The total covered call position
now looks like the red line below:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table14'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/013.gif'>

<p>The red line is our profit and loss diagram for the
covered call position.&nbsp; We see that the break-even has
now been reduced to $45 because of the $5 premium
received from the call.&nbsp; However, for <u>any</u> stock
price above $60, there is no more appreciation in the
position as there is for the long stock position.&nbsp; The
maximum that can be made, in this example, is $15.&nbsp;
How?&nbsp; If the stock is $60, we make $10 on our stock
because we paid $50, but also made $5 from the call for
a total of $15.&nbsp; If the stock is higher than $60, it
does not matter; we are under contract to sell it for
$60, so our profit is still $15.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now here is the price you pay for entering into a
covered call position.&nbsp; YOU are holding ALL of the
downside risk!&nbsp; You cannot sell your stock until
expiration of the call unless you are willing to buy the
call back, which could be a loss.&nbsp; Otherwise, you must
wait for expiration in order to fully profit by the $5
premium.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table15'>
<tr vAlign='top'>

<div align='left'>
<h2>The Myth Of Covered Calls</h2>
<p>There is a lot of bad information
floating around out there about covered
calls.&nbsp; If you ask most people, brokers
included, you will hear that the &quot;risk&quot; of a
covered call position is that you may have
to sell your stock for a price below
market.&nbsp; In other words, the stock may be
trading at $100 but you have to sell it for
$60.&nbsp; Look at all of the points on the above
chart at $60 or above -- the points where
you will likely be assigned on the option
and must sell your stock.&nbsp; Is this the
&quot;risky&quot; area of the chart?&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; It is our
maximum profit zone, exactly the points
where you want to be.&nbsp; There are a lot of
professionals and academic journals that
surprisingly make this mistake.&nbsp; It is a
huge myth in the marketplace.&nbsp; The risk of
any position is not missing out on some
reward.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are really sharp, you may have
noticed that the covered call profit/loss
diagram is exactly the same shape as that
for the short put shown earlier.&nbsp; These are
called &quot;synthetic equivalents&quot; (and will be
discussed in detail at a later time).&nbsp;
Covered calls are often considered among the
&quot;safest&quot; strategies while naked puts are
considered to be one of the riskiest.&nbsp;
Covered calls and naked puts are,
incorrectly, considered by many to be polar
opposites in terms of risk.&nbsp; Even option
approval levels with your broker will
usually require the lowest level for covered
calls and the highest level for naked puts.&nbsp;
Yet, from a profit and loss standpoint, they
are exactly the same strategies.</p>
<p>Now you should understand the beauty of
profit/loss diagrams.&nbsp; They can help uncover
the myths.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The risk with the covered call is the
same as with the naked put.&nbsp; <b>The risk is
that the stock goes down.</b></div>
</td>

</table>
<p>So who should enter into a covered call position?&nbsp; If
you write calls against stock you would hold regardless,
then writing calls can be a great strategy because you
were willing to assume the risk with or without the
covered call.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But if you are buying the stock <u>because</u> of the
premium, then you should strongly reconsider your
strategy.&nbsp; People who do this are known as <i>
premium-seekers</i>, as they seek out the very high
premiums on the options, then buy the stock just to gain
the premium.&nbsp; I have witnessed, on more than one
occasion, million dollar accounts becoming virtually
worthless doing nothing but covered calls using this
method. </p>
<h2>Long straddles</h2>
<p>The long straddle is a position where the trader buys
a call and a put with same strikes and expiration.&nbsp; The
idea behind the strategy is that a large move is
expected but the trader is unsure about which
direction.&nbsp; Usually, this strategy is used prior to an
earnings report, FDA approval for a drug company or some
other big announcement.&nbsp; If the report is favorable, the
stock may run wild to the upside; if not, it may tank.&nbsp;
So the strategy plays both sides.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We will be discussing straddles in detail at a later
time, but we do want to make the point that playing
straddles solely for news announcements is usually not a
good strategy, as the price of the calls and puts will
already factor in the expected rise or fall of the
stock.&nbsp; This means that it will usually be difficult to
get out of the straddle for a profit.&nbsp; A bigger reason
to play straddles is if you think the market has
underestimated the volatility.</p>
<p>Say a trader buys a $50 call for $5 and a $50 put for
$3 for a total of $8.&nbsp; What does its profit/loss diagram
look like:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table16'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/014.gif'>

<p>It is easy to see now where your profit zones are.&nbsp;
This trader will need to see the stock go above $58 (the
strike plus both premiums) or below $42 (the strike
minus both premiums).&nbsp; If the stock stays between these
two points, at expiration, the trader will lose a
maximum of $8.</p>
<p>Be aware of seminars or books that announce, &quot;We'll
show you how to make money regardless of where the stock
moves&quot; as they are usually talking about straddles.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The downside to the straddle is that you are
basically buying a very expensive call <i>and</i> a very
expensive put.&nbsp; In effect, you are buying the call for
the price of a call and a put.&nbsp; You are also buying a
put for the price of a call and a put.&nbsp; This is because
you must buy both options to complete the straddle yet
only one will be in-the-money at expiration (unless the
stock closes exactly at $50 or under a rare partial
tender offer where <i>both</i> options can expire
in-the-money).&nbsp; This makes the straddle very tough to <i>
profit</i> from unless you get a tremendous move in the
stock.&nbsp; So, while you may &quot;make money&quot; on either leg of
the spread, that's not necessarily the same as being
profitable.</p>
<p>Okay, ready for one more?</p>
<h2>Ratio spread</h2>
<p>Let's look at a more complicated position -- the
ratio spread.&nbsp; I am only showing this to demonstrate the
power of the profit and loss diagrams and why you should
learn to use them.&nbsp; I will not even discuss the strategy
(although it will be available in another section), but
instead, I want to see if you can identify the critical
points.</p>
<p>First of all, let's say a trader buys 10 $50 strike
calls for $5 and sells 35 $65 strike calls for $1-3/4.&nbsp;
That's a ratio spread, or ratio-write with calls.</p>
<p>Now, think about this for a minute.&nbsp; Just by looking
at the above ratio spread, can you tell what the trader
wants the stock to do?&nbsp; Where the maximum profit and
loss is?&nbsp; Where the danger zones are?</p>
<p>It's pretty tough, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now let's use the profit and loss diagram for the
ratio spread described and see if we can answer the
questions a little easier:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table17'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/015.gif'>

<p>Much easier, isn't it?&nbsp; We can now see that the
trader will make money if the stock either collapses
below $50 or rises up to $65, which is the point of
maximum profit.&nbsp; After $65, the trader starts to lose
some profits and will reach a break-even point around
$73.&nbsp; Beyond $73, unlimited losses will occur.</p>
<p>Would you have been able to analyze the trade in this
way just knowing that the trader bought 10 $50 calls at
$5 and sold 35 $65 strikes at $1-3/4?&nbsp; Don't feel bad,
most people can't.&nbsp; But that's what profit and loss
diagrams are for.</p>
<p>Learn to use them, as they will greatly help your
understanding of option strategies!</p>
