<h1>Whiplash Orders</h1>

<p>When you place an option order, there are many types
of orders and contingencies from which to choose.&nbsp; For
example, there are market orders and limit orders, day
and good-til-canceled, all-or-none and many others.&nbsp;
Most traders are very familiar with these and they can
greatly help your trading skills by making use of each
of them under various conditions.</p>
<p>However, there is one type of order that is rarely
talked about, in fact, it is even unknown by most
brokers.&nbsp; It is called a <i>whiplash </i>order.&nbsp; It can
be one of the most valuable option trading tools
available to you.</p>
<h2>A refresher on limit orders</h2>
<p>Before we get into the whiplash order, it is
important to understand the basic limit order.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A limit order is when you <u>specify</u> the price at
which you are willing to buy or sell.&nbsp; For example, you
can tell your broker to buy 10 contracts at a limit of
$3.&nbsp; This means the order cannot be filled unless it is
for $3 (or less).&nbsp; The drawback is that the order may
never fill.&nbsp; Likewise, you can place an order to sell
your contracts at a limit of $15; now your order will
not fill unless you get $15 (or higher).&nbsp; Limit orders
guarantee the price but not the execution.</p>
<p>One reason that options are so difficult to trade
with limit prices is because the option is tied to an
underlying stock.&nbsp; Many traders, especially with index
options, like to sell their options when the stock or
index hits a certain level.&nbsp; For example, say the OEX is
trading at 725 and you hold 10 OEX Dec $730 calls.&nbsp; You
want to sell them when the index hits 735.&nbsp; The question
now is how much will the calls be worth?</p>
<p>Many traders often refer to the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model to figure out what the limit price should
be.&nbsp; The problem with this is that we do not know <i>
when</i> the index will hit that level.&nbsp; If it happens
quickly, the option will be worth much more than if
happens over the course of a month.&nbsp; Further, we do not
know what the implied volatility level will be.&nbsp; In
short, we have no way to determine a good estimate.</p>
<p>So, what can a trader do?</p>
<h2>Whiplash order</h2>
<p>This is where the whiplash order comes in handy.&nbsp; The
trader in the above example could tell his broker to
sell 10 $730 OEX calls <b>W</b>hen<b> L</b>evel of <b>S</b>tock
<b>H</b>its 735, or WLSH = 735.&nbsp; The letters WLSH
resemble a shortened version of the word &quot;whiplash,&quot;
hence the name.&nbsp; By the way, most brokerage firms will
require whiplash orders to be at least 10 contracts.</p>
<p>Now, when the index hits 735, this order will become
a market order and be sold.&nbsp; Keep in mind, this order <u>
does not</u> guarantee a profit.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Say the trader
paid $20 for the contract and the index hits $735 with
only a few days to expiration; the call may only be $5
leaving the trader with a net loss of $15.</p>
<p>The WLSH order can be modified with a greater than
(&gt;) or less than (&lt;) sign too.&nbsp; For example, a trader
can instruct his broker to sell the contracts WLSH &gt; 735
(or WLSH &gt;= 735) or buy WLSH &lt; 715.</p>
<p>You can get fancy and cross stocks or indices if you
prefer.&nbsp; As some examples, you can sell your OEX calls
when NDX hits a certain level.&nbsp; Likewise, you can sell
your MSFT calls when the NDX hits a certain level or
maybe buy INTC when MSFT goes below a certain level.</p>
<p>Crossing indices (or stocks) is probably not the best
way to trade, but there may be certain circumstances
where it may be warranted.</p>
<p>You should contact your broker to see if they handle
whiplash orders or similar orders under a different
name.&nbsp; They can be an invaluable tool for the option
investor!</p>
