<h1>Strips & Straps</h1>

<p>Options are very versatile and one of the most
powerful tools you can learn as a trader is how to
combine them to create unique profit and loss profiles
that exactly meet your needs.</p>
<p>Although the terms are not used much anymore, strips
and straps are two very basic combinations that
demonstrate this ability.</p>
<h2>Strips</h2>
<p>A strip is a strategy where the trader buys one call
and two puts with the same strike and expiration dates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you read the section on straddles, you will see
these strategies are similar.&nbsp; With a strip, though, the
investor is unsure about the direction, but is putting a
little more emphasis on the downside move.&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, let's look at the straddle which is one long
one call and one long put with the same strikes and
expiration dates.&nbsp; Assuming this investor paid $8 for
the two positions, the profit and loss will look like
this:</p>

<p>The strip, because it has two puts instead of one
will look like this:</p>

<p>It is evident from the profit and loss diagram that
the investor will profit more from a fall in the stock
as compared to a rise.&nbsp; This strategy exactly matches
the investor's sentiment of the stock.&nbsp; The tradeoff is
that the strip costs more than the straddle simply for
the fact that you are buying an additional put for the
strip.&nbsp; Because of this additional cost, a bigger rise
in the stock will be necessary before break-even is
achieved to the upside with the strip as compared to the
straddle.&nbsp; Conversely, the strip will show a profit
quicker as compared to the straddle if the stock should
fall.&nbsp; Both strategies hit maximum loss at the strike
price, as all options will expire worthless here.</p>
<h2>Strap</h2>
<p>A strap is basically the opposite of the strip:&nbsp; the
investor buys two calls but only one put.&nbsp; In this case,
the investor is betting that there is a higher chance
the stock will rise but is still uncertain so wants to
play the downside as well.&nbsp; Looking at the profit and
loss diagrams for the straddle and strap:</p>

<p>Again we see the traders biases built into the
strategy.&nbsp; If the stock rises, as he believes, he will
profit at a much greater pace.&nbsp; However, if the stock
falls, he will still profit but will have a much lower
break-even point as compared to the straddle.</p>
<p>These simple strategies should suggest just how
powerful options can be.&nbsp; Not only can you build your
profit and loss lines in the direction you want, you can
adjust the rates of profit and losses.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no reason to stop here!&nbsp; An
investor could easily buy three puts for every one call,
or three calls for every put.&nbsp; Hopefully you get the
idea.&nbsp; Options are very versatile!</p>
