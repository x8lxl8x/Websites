<h1>Jelly Rolls</h1>

<p>Breakfast menu?&nbsp; No, it's an actual options
strategy.&nbsp; There doesn't appear to be any particular
reason for the name, although rumor has it that market
makers on the floor of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) created it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jelly rolls are primarily used by market makers, but
are a great tool for retail investors to evaluate the
fair price between calendar spreads in the same way that
box spreads can be used to evaluate vertical spreads.</p>
<p>While you may never enter a jelly roll, they are
crucial to understand if you are placing calendar
spreads -- spreads where you buy and sell calls or puts
of the same strike, but at different expiration months.</p>
<h2>Jelly rolls</h2>
<p>There are many ways to view and understand the jelly
roll strategy, but it is probably easiest to view from
the market makers perspective.&nbsp; If you read our section
on synthetics, you will recall that market makers like
to enter conversions and reversals -- three sided
positions -- involving stock, calls and puts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Conversions (long stock, long puts and short calls)
and reversals (short stock, short puts and long calls)
are ways for market makers to lock in profits, so they
are always looking for orders that allow them to create
these positions.</p>
<p>Say a market maker has the following <i>reversal</i>
for January expiration:</p>
<p>Short 1,000 shares at $50<br>
Long 10 $50 calls<br>
Short 10 $50 puts</p>
<p>And also has the following <i>conversion</i> for
March expiration:</p>
<p>Long 1,000 shares at $50<br>
Long 10 $50 puts<br>
Short 10 $50 calls</p>
<p>This is a jelly roll -- a conversion in one month and
a reversal in another.</p>
<p>Notice the market maker is <u>short</u> 1,000 shares
in the reversal and <u>long</u> 1,000 shares in the
conversion -- a net zero position.&nbsp; This leaves him with
long calls and short puts (synthetic long position) in
January, and long puts and short calls (synthetic short
position) in March as follows:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td><b><u>January reversal</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>March
conversion</u></b><br>
<s>Short 1,000 shares at
$50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long 1,000 shares at $50</s><p>
Long 10 $50 calls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long
10 $50 puts<br>
Short 10 $50 puts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short
10 $50 calls</p>
<p><i>The long and short stock positions cancel
each other (shown in red).&nbsp; The remaining
positions are a synthetic long position (blue)
in January and a synthetic short position
(black) in March.</i></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>One way to interpret the January synthetic is that
the market maker <u>will buy stock</u> for $50 at
expiration.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; If the stock is above $50, he can
exercise the call and pay $50; if it's below $50, he
will be assigned on the puts and be forced to buy stock
at $50.&nbsp; Similarly in March he <u>must sell stock</u>
for $50.&nbsp; If the stock is above $50, he will be assigned
on the short calls and be forced to sell stock at $50;
if the stock is below $50, will exercise the $50 puts
and receive that amount for the sale.</p>
<p>The market maker is therefore left with a position
that forces him to buy stock for $50 in January and sell
it for $50 in March.&nbsp; What is the cost?&nbsp; It should be
evident that the market maker is not losing any
principal as he's buying and selling at $50; however, he
is missing out on the interest he could have earned
during the three months had he not been forced to
purchase the stock in January.&nbsp; Assuming the risk-free
rate of interest is 6% and exactly three months to
expiration, the cost is $50 * 3/12 months * 6% = $3/4.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the difference in cost between the
synthetic long position in January and synthetic short
position in March should be about $3/4.&nbsp; If the January
synthetic costs $10, the March synthetic should cost
$10-3/4.</p>
<p>If the stock pays a dividend, this must be subtracted
from the position as well, because it represents a cash
inflow.&nbsp; If the above stock pays a 1/4-point dividend in
March, the spread value would be reduced by 1/4 point
from $10-3/4 to $10-1/2.</p>
<h2>Calendar spreads</h2>
<p>We can also view the synthetic long and short
positions as calendar spreads:</p>
<p><b><u>January</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>March</u></b><br>
Short 10 $50 puts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long 10 $50 puts = Long
calendar spread<br>
<u>Long 10 $50 call</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Short 10 $50
calls</u> = Short calendar spread<br>
= Long synthetic stock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=Short synthetic stock</p>
<p>If we view the positions vertically, we see the
market maker has a long synthetic stock position in
January and short synthetic stock position in March.&nbsp;
This is the way we were viewing the positions earlier.&nbsp;
However, we can also view them horizontally and say he
is long a put calendar spread (long Mar $50 puts and
short Jan $50 puts) and short a call calendar spread
(short Mar $50 calls and long Jan $50 calls).</p>
<p>An equally valid way, then, to view the jelly roll is
the difference between two calendar spreads (also called
<i>time</i> or <i>horizontal</i> spreads).</p>
<p>If you trade calendar spreads, here's where the jelly
roll can help!</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Intel (INTC) is currently trading for $36-7/8 with
the following quotes:</p>

<p>Say you are interested in the following long calendar
spread:&nbsp; Long April $35 calls and short January $35
calls.&nbsp; The natural quote is currently $2-1/4 debit:</p>
<p>Buy Apr&nbsp; $35 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp; $7-5/8<br>
<u>Sell Jan&nbsp; $35 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp; $5-3/8</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $2-1/4</p>
<p>Because there is a net payment (debit), this is a <i>
long</i> calendar spread.</p>
<p><b><i>Traders often ask if this is a fair price.&nbsp; Is
there room to negotiate?&nbsp; If so, how much?</i></b></p>
<p>To answer these questions, let's look at the value of
the synthetic long and short stock positions from the
retail investor's side.&nbsp; An investor buying a synthetic
long position will pay the asking price and sell at the
bid price.&nbsp; As a guide, these numbers are highlighted
below: red is a debit and blue is a credit. </p>

<p>The retail investor can create the January synthetic
long and April synthetic short for: +7 1/4 - $5 3/4 + $3
1/8 - $4 5/8 = $0.&nbsp; So a retail investor will receive
zero credit for the trade.&nbsp; How much should it be worth
theoretically?&nbsp; There are approximately 135 days to
expiration, so the cost of carry is roughly $35 *
135/360 * 6% = 0.79 cents.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In addition, any dividends received must be <i>
subtracted</i>.&nbsp; Intel is currently paying 2 cents per
share.&nbsp; The dividend is expected during the life of the
jelly roll, so the cost is reduced from 79 cents to
about 77 cents[*].&nbsp; Most of the time dividends are not a
big concern, especially for tech companies.&nbsp; But in
cases where the dividends are sizeable, be sure to
factor it into the cost.</p>
<p>[*]Technically, the credit will be
reduced by the <i>present value</i> of the dividend.&nbsp;
This is because the investor must wait to receive the
dividend.&nbsp; However, since most dividends are small as
well as the time between buying and selling the stock,
most traders will just subtract off the full amount of
the dividend as a very close estimate.</p>
<p>The trade should be worth a credit of 77 cents, but
the retail investor receives zero.&nbsp; The spread is
clearly not priced fairly at the bid and ask prices for
the retail investor.</p>
<p>How about from the market makers' perspective?&nbsp; Using
the same color coded notation as before, the market
maker can create the synthetic January $35 long position
by buying the Jan $35 call at the bid and selling the
Jan $35 put at the ask.&nbsp; He can also create the
synthetic short April position by purchasing the Apr $35
put on the bid and selling the Apr $35 call at the ask
as shown in the chart below:</p>

<p>The synthetic positions will create a net credit of:
-$5-3/8 + $7-5/8 - $4-1/4 + $3-1/4 = + $1-1/4.</p>
<p>We said earlier the fair price of the package should
be about 77 cents; however, the retail investor receives
nothing, and the market maker wants $1-1/4.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice a key point here.&nbsp; The market maker is able to
construct the synthetic long and short positions with
the color coded trades above.&nbsp; If you recall from the
beginning, we were assuming you were interested in the
calendar spread consisting of long April $35 calls, and
short January $35 calls.&nbsp; You would pay the asking price
on the April $35 calls and sell for the bid price on the
January $35 calls -- exactly two of the pieces the
market maker needs to construct his synthetic positions!</p>
<p>The market maker can offset your trade by buying an
April $35 put at $4-1/4 and selling the January $35 put
at $3-1/4 (remember, market makers buy at the bid and
sell at the ask).&nbsp; In other words, because you want to
be long the calendar spread, the market maker must be
short the same spread in order to fill the order.&nbsp; To
offset the short call calendar spread, he will execute a
long put calendar spread.</p>
<p>Because neither party -- neither you nor the market
maker -- wants to execute the trade for less than 77
cents, it appears you have about 48 cents with which to
work.&nbsp; The market maker wants $1-1/4, but theoretically
should only receive 77 cents for a difference of 48
cents.&nbsp; You probably won't be able to shave the full 48
cents off the price, but 1/4 point certainly looks
reasonable.&nbsp; So the calendar spread we described
earlier:</p>
<p>Buy Apr&nbsp; $35 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp; $7-5/8<br>
Sell Jan&nbsp; $35 calls =&nbsp;&nbsp; $5-3/8</p>
<p>could probably be filled for a net debit of $2
instead of the $2-1/4 natural. </p>
<p>Now, 1/4 point may not seem like much, but on a
relative basis, it's about 11% better than the $2-1/4
debit most traders would be tempted to place.</p>
<p>This is the essence of great options trading --
becoming a <i>little</i> bit better on each trade.&nbsp; It's
the little changes that make big differences on profits.</p>
