<h1>No Options For Me!</h1>

<p>Speculation still seems to be a forbidden word with
the financial press.&nbsp; Magazines, television shows and
many professionals alike will tell you that speculation
is bad for the market and is the cause of the recent
volatility.</p>
<p>There are so many investors who adamantly believe
this and refuse to buy or sell options; they insist on
holding only stocks.&nbsp; <i>But if you refuse to use
options, you are speculating.</i>&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Options were
created as hedging tools.&nbsp; Whenever you hedge, you give
up some upside profits in exchange for some downside
protection (the opposite if you are short the stock).&nbsp;
So if you buy stock and refuse to buy or sell options,
you are speculating that nothing will go wrong with your
long stock position.&nbsp; You are willing to hold out for
more profit at the expense of downside exposure to a
price of zero.&nbsp; In fact, it can be argued that investors
who don't use options are among the most speculative of
all!</p>
<p>If you're still in doubt, would you believe that
stock can be viewed as an option?</p>
<h2>Valuing corporate securities as options</h2>
<p>When Black and Scholes developed their famous
option-pricing model, they were certain there were many
uses for it other than just valuing call options.&nbsp; One
of the uses they suggested was in valuing corporate
securities.</p>
<p>Consider a firm that has issued one zero-coupon bond
that matures to a value of $1,000,000 in five years.&nbsp;
With this money, the firm produces things and hopes to
have a value in excess of this $1,000,000 in five years,
and pays off their debt, leaving the stockholders with
whatever remains in value.&nbsp; However, if the firm's value
is less than $1,000,000 at maturity of the bond, the
stockholders will simply turn over the assets to the
bondholders and will be free of further liability.</p>
<p>Let's look at the payoffs for stockholders and
bondholders at maturity:</p>
<p>If value of the firm is <i>less</i> than $1,000,000,
say, $800,000:<br>
Bondholders get:&nbsp; $800,000<br>
Stockholders get:&nbsp; $0<br>
Total value of firm = $800,000</p>
<p>If the value of the firm is <i>greater</i> than
$1,000,000, say $1,500,000 at maturity:<br>
Bondholders get:&nbsp; $1,000,000<br>
Stockholders get:&nbsp; $500,000<br>
Total value of firm is $1,500,000</p>
<p>We see with the above payoffs that the total value of
the firm is partitioned between the stockholders and
bondholders.&nbsp; Notice how the stockholders get nothing at
expiration if the value of the firm is below the value
of the matured debt.&nbsp; But if the value of the firm is
greater than the matured debt, stockholders receive the
<i>excess value</i>.</p>
<p>Now compare this to options.</p>
<p>You own a $100 call option that someone has written
as a covered position:</p>
<p>At expiration, if the value of the stock is less than
$100, say $80:<br>
Call writers get:&nbsp; $80<br>
Call owners get:&nbsp; $0<br>
Total value of firm is $80</p>
<p>In other words, if the value of the stock is below
the strike at expiration, the covered call writer is
left with the stock at its current value of $80.&nbsp; The
long call position receives nothing.</p>
<p>If the value of the stock is greater than $100, say
$150 at expiration:<br>
Call writers get:&nbsp; $100<br>
Call owners get:&nbsp; $50<br>
Total value of firm is $150</p>
<p>If the value of the stock is above the strike at
expiration, the covered call writer will be assigned and
receive the $100 strike price.&nbsp; The call owners will
receive the stock and pay the strike for a value of the
stock price minus the strike price.&nbsp; The stockholders,
in this case, receive what's left over after the
bondholders are paid.</p>
<p>If you look closely, you will see that the payoff for
the call option above exactly resembles the payoffs to
the stockholders for the corporation discussed earlier.</p>
<h2>Using the Black-Scholes Model</h2>
<p>If you read our section on synthetics, you may recall
the put-call parity formula:</p>
<p>Stock + Put - Call = Present value of the exercise
price</p>
<p>We can rewrite this for the above corporation as:</p>
<p>Stock + Put - Call = Present value of the debt</p>
<p>This can be rewritten <i>at maturity</i> as:</p>
<p>Stock - Call = Value of debt - Put</p>
<p>So the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model tells us
that the value of the covered call position (left side
of equation) in our hypothetical firm is equal to the
debt at maturity with a put written against it (right
side of equation).</p>
<p>This means the bondholders have, in essence, written
a put against the firm.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; In other words, if the
value of the firm is less than the debt that is due at
maturity, you &quot;put&quot; the firm back to the bondholders and
walk away losing only what you paid for the stock --
just as when you buy a call option.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>The value of this put is part of what gives your
<i>stock</i> its value!&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>If you like owning stocks for this reason, you should
consider using options in some fashion.&nbsp; Options allow
you to do exactly what you're doing with stock -- but
for a lot less money.&nbsp; They can also be used to create
downside hedges in exchange for upside profits.&nbsp; Because
of these uses, you can create better risk-reward
profiles that are simply not possible with stock alone.</p>
<p>There are many fascinating insights that can be
learned from the Black-Scholes model.&nbsp; Once you have a
better understanding of options, you will start to see
that stockholders are option players in disguise and the
Black-Scholes Model can be used to value corporate
securities too.&nbsp; If you acknowledge this, you may start
to open your eyes to the world of options, and create
new trading opportunities that you never thought
possible.&nbsp;</p>
