<h1>Types Of Orders</h1>

<p>Even if you have the winning stock and matching
option strategy, you still need to get the order in
correctly to carry out your intentions.&nbsp; There is a
whole list of terms, restrictions, and general market
lingo you will need to know in order to maximize your
use of options.&nbsp; Whether you are new or experienced with
options, this section will greatly help with your
trading.</p>
<p>This is especially important with Web trading.&nbsp; Most
firms offer great incentives to place your orders over
the Web. &nbsp;However, you are now at risk by checking off
the wrong box or entering the wrong amount.&nbsp; You will be
given many choices when placing trades over the Web, so
you need to be aware of what these terms mean.</p>
<h2>Opening and closing transactions</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to understand regarding an
option order is that you must specify whether you are
opening or closing the position.&nbsp; For example, if you
want to be long a call option, you will need to place
the order as &quot;buy calls to open.&quot;&nbsp; This is very
different from a stock trade where you just designate
the order as either buy or sell.&nbsp; The reason the options
markets need to know if you are opening or closing the
position is so the OCC (Options Clearing Corporation)
can account for the open interest.&nbsp; For example, you may
be buying the call to open and the person on the other
side of the trade is <i>selling to close</i> their
position.&nbsp; In this case, there is no net change on open
interest, as one party is opening and the other is
closing (please see our section &quot;Open Interest&quot; for more
information).&nbsp; The OCC must track open interest, as
there is no limit to the number of contracts that can be
traded on any individual stock or index as with stocks.&nbsp;
With stocks, you can only buy or sell up to the
available number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Basically, if you are initiating a position for the
first time, you are opening.&nbsp; If you are getting out of
a position, you are closing.</p>
<p>There is a common mistake new traders make when
selling covered calls:&nbsp; They often feel they must
designate the order as some type of buy.&nbsp; This mistake
usually stems from the fact that most other financial
instruments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) are
initiated with a buy.&nbsp; Remember, you are <i>selling the
call</i> and <i>opening the position</i>, so your first
transaction would be &quot;sell calls to open,&quot; then you
would &quot;buy calls to close&quot; if you want to undo the
position.</p>
<p>Always check with a broker if you are unsure.&nbsp; There
is nothing worse than being on the wrong side of the
market because of a mistake on the order.&nbsp; I have seen
this result in very costly mistakes!</p>
<h2>Market versus limit orders</h2>
<p>The next thing your broker will want to know is
whether you are buying at market or at a limit.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>A market order guarantees the execution but not
the price</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In fact, a market order is the only way to make
certain you will get the trade (the only exception is
with a &quot;short sale&quot; on stock which must be executed on
an uptick).&nbsp; However, in order to do that, you must be
willing to accept the best available price at the time
your order hits the floor.&nbsp; So, while you may see an
option quoting $5 - $5-1/2, placing a buy order at
market does not guarantee you the asking price of $5-1/2
as many people think.&nbsp; It's entirely possibly for the
stock to be in a fast market (which means the quotes are
not accurate due to delays in processing orders), and
you find yourself being filled at something like $7.&nbsp; In
most cases, this is unlikely, but just be aware that
with a market order, you are saying that you are willing
to pay any price.&nbsp; You will have no recourse with your
broker by placing a market order and being filled at a
higher price with a buy order, or a lower price with a
sell order.</p>
<p>With a limit order, you tell your broker that you are
willing to buy or sell, but only at a certain price
called the limit price.&nbsp; If you say, &quot;buy calls to open&quot;
at a limit of $6, this means your order will only be
filled if it can be filled for $6 <i>or less</i>.&nbsp; Of
course, your risk is that your order will never get
filled.&nbsp; If you are selling at a limit of $6, your order
can be filled only at $6 <i>or higher</i>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Limit orders guarantee the price but not the
execution</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, a limit order may be filled in part unlike a
market order.&nbsp; For example, if you place an order to buy
30 contracts at a limit of $6, it's possible that you
get filled on 20 contracts or some other number less
than 30.&nbsp; What you are really telling your broker is
that you are willing to buy <i>up to</i> 30 contracts.&nbsp;
If you only want all 30 or nothing at all, you will need
to use an &quot;all-or-none&quot; restriction discussed later.</p>
<p>When placing an order, you need to figure out which
is more important -- making sure it is filled (market
orders), or making sure you get a certain price (limit
orders).&nbsp; There is no way to guarantee the execution <i>
and</i> price -- you get one or the other.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are placing a limit order on
options, you need to be aware of the following rule:&nbsp;
Options quoted at $3 or less may be entered in 1/16ths
and options quoted above $3 must be entered in minimums
of 1/8ths.&nbsp; So, if you see an option quoting $3-1/2 to
$3-3/4, do not send in a limit order at $3-9/16; the
floor will return your order to be re-entered in 1/8ths.
Under decimalization, the new MPV's (Minimum Price
Variations) are as follows: options under $3 may be
entered in .05 increments while options over $3 must be
entered in .10 increments. </p>
<h2>Or-better orders</h2>
<p>There is a type of limit order which sort of blends a
market and limit order, called an &quot;or better&quot;
condition.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>With an or-better order, you place buy orders
above the current asking price, and sell orders below
the current bid price</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Say an option is $5 on the ask.&nbsp; You can tell your
broker to buy at a limit of $5-1/2 <i>or better</i>, for
example.&nbsp; Now, when your order hits the floor, you will
be filled as long as it doesn't exceed $5-1/2.&nbsp; Some
people think this is a recipe for ruin as the floor will
probably fill you at the higher $5-1/2 price.&nbsp; This is
not true, as the traders are bound by time-and-sales,
which reflect the current prices at the time your order
was received.&nbsp; With or-better orders, your order is
still not guaranteed to fill, but the odds are much
higher compared to a straight limit order.&nbsp; I would
almost always use &quot;or better&quot; orders if the underlying
stock is moving quickly.</p>
<h2>Day, good-until-cancelled, immediate-or-cancel,
fill-or-kill</h2>
<p>If you use a limit order or an or-better order, you
must also specify a time period that the order is to
remain open.&nbsp; Technically there are four different time
designations: day, good-until-cancelled,
immediate-or-cancel, and fill-or-kill.&nbsp; By far, most
trades are entered as either day or
good-until-cancelled, but we will go over each so you
understand them all.</p>
<p>Remember: a limit order is not guaranteed to fill, so
your broker will need to know if you want the order
cancelled at the end of the day (day order), or
cancelled after a much longer period (up to six months)
with a good-'til-cancelled order, also called GTC.&nbsp; The
New York Stock Exchange allows firms to keep the orders
on the books for up to six months.&nbsp; However, individual
firms are free to make the requirements stricter.&nbsp; They
may, for example, only hold a GTC order for two months.&nbsp;
Check with your broker as to their firm's policy on GTC
orders.</p>
<p>Be careful with GTC orders, though -- especially when
buying!&nbsp; There have been many cases where people place
GTC buy orders and then forget about them.&nbsp; Weeks later
they see an option position in the account trading for a
huge loss and wonder how it got there.&nbsp; It's probably
not a good idea to use GTC buy orders on options for
this very reason unless you actively monitor your
account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, using GTC sell orders can be a very good
portfolio management tool.&nbsp; For example, say you buy an
option at $5 and are willing to sell it for $8.&nbsp; By
placing a GTC order to sell it at $8, you now never have
to worry about not being at your computer to place the
order if it trades that high -- the computer will take
care of it for you.&nbsp; Further, you will not be tempted to
hang on hoping for more if you see it trade at $8, as
the computer will automatically sell it.&nbsp; Using GTC sell
orders can be a great tool for disciplined trading.</p>
<p>Instead of day or GTC, you can elect your timeframe
to be immediate-or-cancel or fill-or-kill also known as
IOC and FOK orders respectively.&nbsp; Both orders are asking
for an <u>immediate execution or cancellation</u> of the
order.&nbsp; The difference is that immediate-or-cancel
orders allow for partial fills while fill-or-kill orders
must be filled in entirety.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, if you enter an order to sell 50
contracts at $7 immediate-or-cancel, the market maker
may fill a portion of that order at $7 or higher; they
are not required to fill the entire 50 lot order.&nbsp; A
fill-or-kill order would require that they fill the
entire 50 contracts immediately, or none at all.&nbsp; These
orders are often used to pressure the market makers into
making a decision, and consequently, are usually
cancelled!&nbsp; It is recommended that you do not use these
orders. &nbsp;Any trader who gets filled by using them
probably would have been filled with a day or
good-til-cancelled order as well.&nbsp; There is not a big
advantage to the immediate-or-cancel or fill-or-kill
orders, and there's a great chance it may hurt the
execution.</p>
<p>Why don't you use day, GTC, IOC, or FOK time frames
with market orders?&nbsp; Remember, market orders are
guaranteed to execute, so they will default to a day
order and normally be filled within seconds.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>All-or-none </h2>
<p>If you place a limit order, for example, to buy 30
contracts at a limit of $5, it is possible to get filled
on only a portion, say 20 contracts.&nbsp; With a limit
order, you are telling your broker to buy <i>up to</i>
the amount designated (30 contracts in this example).&nbsp;
If, however, you want to insure that you get all 30
contracts or nothing at all, you need to use an
&quot;all-or-none&quot; restriction, also designated AON.&nbsp; If you
use this restriction, you are telling the floor to fill
the entire order, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>There is a big danger in using all-or-none orders!&nbsp;
Any order marked all-or-none goes to the back of the
line (for listed stocks), or is held in the back pocket
of a trader for options.&nbsp; This means that it is possible
you'll never get an execution, even though many traded
at your price or better, and you cannot hold the
exchange to time and sales!&nbsp; The trader can always come
back and say that all contracts could never be filled at
once and you will have <u>no recourse</u> against your
broker or the exchange.</p>
<p>Also, all option quotes are good for <u>at least</u>
20 contracts.&nbsp; So, if you are placing option orders for
20 contracts or less, you will be doing yourself a huge
disservice by placing all-or-none restrictions on these
orders.</p>
<h2>Minimums and minimum lots</h2>
<p>If you don't like the idea of all-or-none
restrictions, you can opt for a minimum.&nbsp; For example,
say you are selling 50 contracts but want at least 30 or
nothing at all.&nbsp; You can place the order to sell 50 with
a minimum of 30.</p>
<p>Further, if you only want your trade filled in
minimums of 5 contracts thereafter, you can tell your
broker &quot;minimum lots&quot; of 5.&nbsp; So the order would look
like &quot;sell 50 contracts, minimum 30, and minimum lots
5.&quot;&nbsp; Now the order must be filled with at least 30
initially, and in 5 lot increments thereafter, such as
35, 40, etc. up to 50.</p>
<p>Minimums and minimum lots are a nice alternative to
all-or-none orders.</p>
<h2>Market on close</h2>
<p>There is a really nice tool that's not widely used by
most traders.&nbsp; It's called a market-on-close order or
MOC.&nbsp; With an MOC order, you try to buy or sell your
contracts at a limit price during the trading day.&nbsp; If
it is not filled, it converts to a market order within
the last five or so minutes of the trading day.&nbsp; For
example, say you bought 10 contracts at $2 and they are
now selling for $10.&nbsp; The market looks really strong and
there is a possibility it could trade much higher.&nbsp;
However, you don't want to lose your profit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You could place an order to sell your 10 contracts at
a limit of $12 MOC.&nbsp; Now, if the option trades at $12 or
higher, you will be filled.&nbsp; But, if it doesn't trade
that high, you will be sold very close to the closing
price of the day.&nbsp; Keep in mind this could be much less
than you anticipated!&nbsp; But MOC orders can be a great
tool, as they allow you to try for better prices during
the day, but get you executed by the end of the day
regardless.</p>
<h2>Net credits and net debits</h2>
<p>Net credits and net debits are types of limit
orders,&nbsp; but are used for multiple option orders.&nbsp; For
example, you may enter a buy-write, which allows you to
simultaneously buy stock and sell a call against it
(please see our section on &quot;Buy-Writes&quot; for more
information).&nbsp; If the stock is trading for $50 and the
call is trading for $3, you can enter the buy-write for
a net debit of $47.&nbsp; This tells your broker that you are
willing to buy the stock and sell the call as long as
the net charge to you does not exceed $47.&nbsp; The floor
could fill the stock purchase price at $50-1/2 but would
have to fill the call for $3-1/2 or any other
combination that nets a $47 debit.&nbsp; Often, traders will
try to &quot;negotiate&quot; a better deal, and may enter the
above order for a net debit of $46-1/2 for example.</p>
<p>Net credit orders are just the reverse of net
debits.&nbsp; Say you bought the above buy-write for $46-1/2
debit and it is now trading for $48-1/2. &nbsp;You could
enter the reverse of this trade, called an &quot;unwind,&quot;
which sells the stock and buys the call for a net credit
of $48-1/2.&nbsp; Now the order cannot be filled unless the
net proceeds to you are $48-1/2 or higher.</p>
<h2>Stop orders</h2>
<p>Stop orders can be a great risk-management tool.&nbsp;
They can also cause great losses is you're not sure how
they work.</p>
<p>If you are planning to use stop orders on your option
trades, make sure you understand this section.</p>
<p><b>How do stop orders work?</b></p>
<p>There are two basic types of stop orders: <i>stop
orders</i> and <i>stop limit orders</i>.&nbsp; There are very
important difference between the two, so we'll look at
them individually.</p>
<p>First, the basics of stop orders are the same for
stocks and options.&nbsp; There is one major difference with
options though, and we'll look at that at the end.&nbsp; For
now, we'll just concentrate on how basic stop and stop
limits work with stocks.</p>
<p><b>Stop order</b></p>
<p>A stop order is a conditional order to buy or sell at
market.&nbsp; You specify a price at which point the trade is
&quot;triggered&quot; and becomes a market order to either buy or
sell.</p>
<p>For example, say you paid $30 for a stock and it is
now $50.&nbsp; You feel it could climb much higher so would
like to keep holding it, but at the same time, you do
not want to see it fall back to $30.&nbsp; You could place an
order to sell your shares at a stop price of $45, for
example.&nbsp; When you specify a stop price, that is the
&quot;trigger price,&quot; and is not necessarily the price you
will get for your shares.&nbsp; So if the stock <u>trades</u>
at $45, your order is triggered and becomes a market
order, which will be filled at the next best available
price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is very important to note that the stock needs to
trade at <u>or through</u> your price in order to become
triggered.&nbsp; Here is where a lot of traders get
themselves in trouble.&nbsp; Using the above example, say the
trader places a stop at $45 and the stock closes that
day at $45-1/2.&nbsp; The order is not triggered, so the
trader at this point still has his shares.&nbsp; However, the
first trade the following morning is $38 on bad news.&nbsp;
Because the last trade is through the stop price of $45,
this trader will be filled at market -- around $38,
which is very different from the stop price of $45.</p>
<p>Remember, the stop price is only a trigger point --
the point where the order is activated.&nbsp; It is not the
price you will necessarily receive!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Stop orders used to be called &quot;stop loss&quot; orders
until the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled to
change the name because it was misleading.&nbsp; It sounds
like the order will prevent a loss, which is definitely
not true.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Trading Case</h2>
<p>One of the worst cases I can remember was
with a trader who had 3,000 shares of one of the
&quot;dot com&quot; stocks back when they were hot.&nbsp; This
person paid around $100 per share, so he had a
decent profit with the stock trading around
$120.&nbsp; He placed an order to sell the shares at
a stop price of $110.&nbsp; The stock started to fall
radically with every couple of trades decreasing
the stock by a point or so.&nbsp; The stock traded at
$110 and continued to fall.&nbsp; The customer was
impatiently calling to find out where he finally
sold his stock.&nbsp; After all, a price of $110 was
still a nice profit for him.</p>
<p>The confirmation came back with all shares
being sold at $87.&nbsp; This fill was deemed good by
time and sales; that was the fair price when his
order hit the market maker.</p>
<p>Stop orders do not prevent losses!</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Stop limit orders</h2>
<p>The trader in our first example was hoping to get
around $45 per share if the stock fell.&nbsp; Under normal
circumstances, if the stock falls slowly, stop orders
work great.&nbsp; It's only when you see the large gaps down
where the prices can be very different.</p>
<p>What if the above trader would rather hold the stock
instead of selling it at $38?&nbsp; Is there a way to prevent
the sale?&nbsp; Yes, and that is done with a stop limit
order.</p>
<p>With a stop limit order, you specify two prices.&nbsp; One
is the trigger point and the other is the sell limit
price.&nbsp; The above trader could have placed a stop limit
order by telling his broker to sell at a stop price of
$45 and a stop limit of $45.&nbsp; If the stock trades at $45
or below (the stop price) the order will be activated as
with a regular stop order.&nbsp; However, instead of becoming
a market order, a stop limit order becomes a limit order
to sell.&nbsp; This order is saying to activate it at $45
(the stop price), but do not sell for anything less than
$45 (the limit price).&nbsp; The limit price can be equal to
or less than the stop price.</p>
<p>In the above example, when the stock opened at $38,
the trader with the stop limit order would also have
their order activated. &nbsp;However, they will still hold
the shares because they could not be sold for $45 or
higher.&nbsp; If the stock does rise to that price during the
day (or later if a good-til-cancelled order), the stock
will be sold.&nbsp; If you do not want this to happen, you
need to cancel the order.</p>
<p>Notice again that the stop limit order did not
prevent a loss either.&nbsp; This trader still has the
shares! </p>
<h2>Buy stops</h2>
<p>Buy stops work the same as sell stops but just in the
other direction.&nbsp; Usually they are used by short sellers
-- those who borrow shares to sell hoping to buy them
back cheaper at a later time.&nbsp; In order to prevent the
stock from getting away from them to the upside, these
traders often place buy stops. </p>
<p>For example, say a trader shorts shares at $100.&nbsp; The
risk to this trader is if the stock moves higher.&nbsp; In
order to make sure the stock doesn't get away from him,
he may place a buy stop at $110.&nbsp; This is saying to buy
the shares at market if the stock trades at $110 or
higher.&nbsp; Again, this is not necessarily the price he
will pay.</p>
<p>If the trader does not want to pay more than a
certain price, he can elect to place a buy stop limit.&nbsp;
As an example, he could say buy the shares at a stop
price of $110 with a stop limit of $111.&nbsp; If the stock
trades at $110, the order will be activated, but will
only fill if the shares can be purchased for $111 or
lower.</p>
<p>Traders also use buy stops to buy stocks on
momentum.&nbsp; For example, say a stock has been sitting
flat for a very long time at $30.&nbsp; The rumor is that a
new product is expected to be released that could send
it into the hundreds of dollars per share.&nbsp; Rather than
buy it now and possibly wait a long time for that day to
come, traders may put in a buy stop order at $35, for
example.&nbsp; Now, the only time the trader will be filled
is if the stock is trading at $35 or higher.&nbsp; In effect,
the trader is buying the stock only if it appears the
market is starting to rally the stock.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is possible to be filled at a <u>
higher</u> price on a stop or stop limit order.&nbsp; This is
fairly uncommon, but if the stock bounces at the time
your order is triggered, it may be trading at a higher
price when the market maker fills it.</p>
<h2>Stop orders on options</h2>
<p>Stop orders on options work about the same as for
stocks with one big exception.&nbsp; With stocks, the last
trade will trigger a stop order.&nbsp; With options, the
asking price will trigger the order and you will be sold
at the bid.</p>
<p><b>A sell stop will be triggered on the ask and sold
at the bid; a buy stop will be triggered on the bid and
purchased on the ask.</b></p>
<p>This is very important for option traders due to the
leverage in options.&nbsp; Gains can quickly become losses if
you are not careful.</p>
<p>For example, say a stock is trading at $100, and a
$100 call is bid $7 and offered at $7-1/2.&nbsp; A trader
bought 10 contracts earlier for $5 and now places a stop
order at $6.&nbsp; To the novice option trader, this trade
seems nearly risk-free as the trader paid $5 and will
get out at $6 (less some commissions) if the stock
should fall.&nbsp; The stock starts to fall but there are no
trades on the option; however, the quotes on the option
will change as the stock falls.&nbsp; Eventually, the option
quote is bid $5-1/2 and offered at $6.&nbsp; Now the stop
order is triggered because the offering price is $6, but
the trader is sold at the bid price of $5-1/2.&nbsp; That
little 1/2 point spread cost the trader an additional
$500 on top of the commissions. </p>
<h2>Time stops</h2>
<p>Another stop order many option traders use is that of
&quot;time stops.&quot;&nbsp; A time stop is more of a mental stop
order that the trader keeps in his head; it is not one
that can be placed with your broker.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Say a trader buys a 6-month option for $10 and is
hoping to sell for $15 before expiration.&nbsp; The trader
may set a time stop and sell the option if it has not
hit $15 by a certain day.&nbsp; The reason traders do this is
to prevent holding the option too close to expiration
day and seeing the entire premium fall to zero from time
decay.</p>
<p>Stop orders can be great tools when used under the
right circumstances.&nbsp; Be sure you thoroughly understand
the mechanics before using them, as the results can be
upsetting if your expectations are not realistic.</p>
<p>There are many other types of orders and restrictions
but these will be the majority of the terms you will
come in contact with.&nbsp; Always check with your broker
with specific questions, as individual firms can have
different policies.&nbsp; Keep in mind that these orders were
developed for various reasons, each with its own set of
benefits and drawbacks.&nbsp; If you learn the different
types of orders, you will become more flexible in your
option strategies.</p>
