<h1>Large Bid-Ask Spreads</h1>

<p>Often when you are trading options, you will notice
that the bid-ask spreads can become quite large -- as
much as three or four points and more for some of the
more volatile indices.&nbsp; These large spreads are usually
found for deep in-the-money options and long term LEAPS<sup>Â®</sup>.</p>
<p>Understanding why this happens will help you with
trading as well as understanding the importance of not
placing market orders for options that fall into these
categories.</p>
<p>To start, you need to understand how prices are
determined.</p>
<h2>How prices are determined</h2>
<p>All prices are determined by equating supply and
demand.&nbsp; Although there are substantial differences in
the way various securities markets go about equating
these two forces, the basic idea applies.&nbsp; For example,
option equilibrium is determined in the opening
rotation, by the specialist for the New York Stock
Exchange and by numerous market makers for the Nasdaq
market.&nbsp; All methods have their own benefits and
drawbacks but the effects are the same -- they try to
determine the fair price of the security.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple example of how prices are
determined, then include the assumption of a bid-ask
spread later.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Say there are 11 people who are bidding (wanting to
buy) for a particular option and 11 people offering to
sell.&nbsp; The following chart shows their bid and offer
limit orders.&nbsp; Also, to make things easier, we will
assume all participants are placing equal numbers of
contracts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Keep in mind that a bid of $7-1/8, for example, means
that is the <u>highest</u> price that person is willing
to pay; they will gladly pay less, just no higher.&nbsp; An
asking price (or offer) of $7-1/8 is the <u>lowest</u>
for which that person is willing to sell; they will
surely sell for more, just not less.</p>
<p>The question now is what is the fair price for the
option?&nbsp; Again, to make things a little easier, we will
assume no bid-ask spreads at this point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Say the option opens up with a price of $7-1/8, the
highest bid.&nbsp; Because we are assuming there is no bid or
ask spread, any buyer can buy for $7-1/8 and any seller
may sell for the same price.&nbsp; What will happen?&nbsp; If you
look closely at the above chart, you will see that there
is only one buyer (the one bidding $7-1/8) but 11
sellers.&nbsp; Why 11 sellers?&nbsp; Obviously, the lowest offer
of $5-7/8 will certainly be willing to sell for $7-1/8.&nbsp;
So all 11 offers will want to sell, but only one person
is willing to buy -- you have unequal supply and demand.</p>
<p>What happens if you have unequal supply and demand
numbers?&nbsp; If you have unequal numbers, in this case more
sellers than buyers, the sellers will start competing
for that buyer's business and the price will fall.&nbsp; In
order to keep buying or selling pressure from being
prevalent, there must be equal numbers of buyers and
sellers.&nbsp; It can also be shown, although we will not do
it here, that when the numbers are equal, that will be
the point of maximum profit for the market makers, so
they have great incentive to find this point.</p>
<p>Back to the example, what if the option price opens
at $6?&nbsp; Now there will be 10 buyers; all of them will
buy except for the person who bid $5-7/8.&nbsp; For the
sellers, only two people will sell: the person who is
willing to sell for $5-7/8 and the one willing at $6.&nbsp;
Again, we have unequal balance between supply and demand
except, this time, there are more buyers.&nbsp; The buyers
will start to compete for the business of the two people
willing to sell and the price will be bid up.</p>
<p>The price where there is no imbalance is $6-1/2.&nbsp; If
the option's price is $6-1/2, you will have 6 buyers and
6 sellers. </p>
<p>Looking at our bids and offers in the above chart
graphically:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/016.gif'>

<p>We see that at a price of $6-1/2, we can exactly
clear the market; there is a buyer for every seller at
that price. </p>
<p>However, because of the nature of the markets,
market-makers will put in bid-ask spreads as a profit
margin for matching buyers and sellers.&nbsp; So they may
post this option as bid $6-3/8 and offered at $6-5/8.&nbsp;
Now, because of the bid-ask spread, we have three forms
of inefficiencies, and investors must now:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/017.gif'>

<p>1) Pay a higher price ($6- 5/8 vs. $6-1/2)<br>
2) Sell for a lower price ($6-3/8 vs. $6-1/2)<br>
3) Have less volume (5 instead of 6)</p>
<p>These are the three inefficiencies created by bid-ask
spreads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, think about this:&nbsp; What would happen if the
volume were reduced to only four buyers and sellers?</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/018.gif'>

<p>If the volume is reduced to four contracts, the
bid-ask spread will widen as shown by the dotted gray
line above.&nbsp; Notice how much wider the dotted line is
compared to the red line that represented the initial
bid-ask spread (shown in red).</p>
<p>Often you will hear that the large spreads are a
result of market-makers &quot;playing games,&quot; or trying to
cheat you on your order.&nbsp; Bear in mind that the only way
they make money is to fill orders, not just produce
quotes.&nbsp; If the spreads are too wide, investors will not
be attracted to the security and will produce no
volume.&nbsp; In addition, if the spreads are unfairly too
wide, you can be assured another market maker will
compete for the business and narrow the spread.&nbsp; Market
makers are reflecting the liquidity risks by the bid-ask
spreads and their ability to spread the risk by hedging
the position.&nbsp; If you feel a bid-ask spread is too wide,
remember, you are always free to &quot;tighten the spread&quot; by
either bidding higher or selling for less (please see
our section on &quot;Show or Fill Rule&quot;.)</p>
<p>So, what you want to get from all this is that the <u>
market determines the bid-ask spread</u>--not the
market-makers.&nbsp; So if you see an option (or stock, for
that matter) with a large bid-ask spread, just
understand that this is the sign of a potential
liquidity problem.&nbsp; If placing orders in these
securities, it is generally advisable to consider going
&quot;in between&quot; the bid-ask spreads to improve your trading
results.</p>
<p>For example, say the quote is bid $6-1/4 and ask
$6-3/4.&nbsp; If you want to buy, you can buy at the asking
price and pay $6-3/4.&nbsp; Or you can put in a bid above the
current bid of $6-1/4.&nbsp; Say you put in a bid of $6-1/2.&nbsp;
The quote will now jump to bid $6-1/2 and ask $6-3/4.&nbsp;
Notice that your higher bid has tightened the spread.&nbsp;
There is now a higher bidder on the market (that's you)
at $6-1/2, which gives a seller incentive to sell
because of the higher price.&nbsp; The reverse holds true for
sellers.&nbsp; If a seller places an offer below the $6 3/4
quote, say $6-5/8, the quote will now become bid $6-1/2
and ask $6-5/8.&nbsp; The new lower asking price will give
another investor incentive to buy.&nbsp; Notice how the
spread has been further narrowed from the original 1/2
point spread (bid $6 1/4 and ask $6-3/4) to a 1/8th
point spread (bid $6-1/2 and ask $6-5/8).</p>
<p>Large bid-ask spreads can be frustrating, especially
when using options, because of the leverage.&nbsp; Use this
information before entering into the position and do not
be afraid to compete for a better price (unless there is
some reason you absolutely must have the trade).&nbsp; If you
do not get the option, this only represents a lost
opportunity, which is usually better than a lost profit
from being forced to exit a position that holds large
bid-ask spreads.</p>
