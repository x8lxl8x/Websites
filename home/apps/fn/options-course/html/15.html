<h1>Buy or Sell</h1>

<h2>Better to buy or sell options?</h2>
<p>There are a number of investors who adamantly believe
you are better off selling options as opposed to
buying.&nbsp; They reason that since most buyers lose money,
it must be better to be a seller.&nbsp; While this may make
sense on the surface, it completely neglects other
factors of option trading.&nbsp; With a little effort, we
will show you that neither the buyer nor the seller has
a long-term advantage.</p>
<p>This is not to say that, under certain conditions, a
buyer or seller cannot have a theoretical edge on the
trade.&nbsp; That happens all the time.&nbsp; We are talking about
making an unconditional statement that one side has an
advantage over the other.</p>
<h2>Equilibrium -- the efficient markets theory</h2>
<p>Is it better to own a Porsche Boxster or a Ford
Taurus?</p>
<p>Many people are tempted to answer that the Porsche is
clearly the better choice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What if the Ford Taurus and Porsche Boxster are both
priced the same?&nbsp; With both cars priced the same, most
would agree that you are better off with the Porsche.&nbsp;
If so, people will buy the Porsche over the Taurus.&nbsp;
This will put buying pressure on the Porsche and raise
its price relative to the Taurus.&nbsp; Say the Porsche is
now bid up to a price $3,000 above the Taurus.&nbsp; Most
would agree that it is still a better deal and continue
to buy it.&nbsp; This action will continue until the markets
are not so sure that an additional $1 is worth jumping
from the Taurus to the Boxster.&nbsp; If it were worth it,
they would do it.</p>
<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, as long as there
is no net bidding up or down of prices between the two
cars, you are equally well off with either one.&nbsp; While
the Porsche may be faster and have higher quality and
resale value (not to mention it just looks cooler), it
also comes with higher repair bills, insurance rates,
and theft occurrences.&nbsp; The car market will reflect all
pros and cons in the prices of the two cars.</p>
<p>Similarly, the financial markets will price all
assets to reflect their risks.&nbsp; Quality assets are bid
up and riskier assets are sold off.&nbsp; This is why a
government T-bill yielding 5% is equal to a more risky
bond priced to yield 10%.&nbsp; The government bond is higher
quality but also has a lower yield.&nbsp; The markets realize
that, all else constant, you are better off with the
T-bill so it will continue to bid that price up until
there is no net difference between the two bonds.&nbsp; If
there were an advantage, the markets would continue
taking action and reflect it in the price.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, the market's action in the
above examples is a form of the <i>efficient market
theory</i> (called the semi-strong form), which states
that all publicly available information is priced into
the asset.&nbsp; The markets will price all assets so that
the risk-reward ratios are equal across the board.</p>
<p>So is it better to be a seller of options as opposed
to a buyer?&nbsp; Now you should know that, on average, there
is no difference between the two choices.&nbsp; The markets
will reflect the risk in the prices.&nbsp; If it were <u>
always</u> true that, say, sellers of call options were
better off, the market would continue to sell calls and
drive down their price.&nbsp; The price will stop falling
when buyers purchase all that is for sale and there is
no net selling.&nbsp; At that point, equilibrium is reached
and the assets are priced fairly.</p>
<p>Do not be lured into strategies that claim you are
always better off as a buyer of this or a seller of
that.&nbsp; If you do, you may encounter a very expensive
understanding of efficient markets.</p>
