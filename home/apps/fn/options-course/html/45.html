<h1>Condor</h1>

<h2>Condor, albatross, pterodactyl spreads</h2>
<p>Once again, the traders have given some creative
names to another class of wingspreads -- strategies with
profit and loss diagrams resembling wings.&nbsp; The condor,
albatross and pterodactyl spreads are all similar to the
butterfly spread (please see &quot;Butterfly Spreads&quot; for
more information) except each of these strategies sells
multiple strikes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It should be noted that, like the butterfly, these
spreads are really meant to be used as floor trader
tools for hedging and taking advantage of small pricing
discrepancies that periodically appear in the market.&nbsp;
Because of the large number of strikes involved, the
commissions usually make these losing strategies for
retail investors.</p>
<p>This does not mean that you should not take the time
to understand them.&nbsp; They will increase your knowledge
of options and give insights into the versatility of
options by showing how strategies can be stacked on one
another.</p>
<h2>Condor spread</h2>
<p>The condor spread is a strategy involving four
strikes and can be made up of calls, puts or a
combination of both.&nbsp; The basic condor spreads are
usually constructed with either calls or puts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To execute a basic condor spread, a trader needs four
strikes, which we will call S1, S2, S3 and S4 with each
strike being successively higher and having the same
expiration.&nbsp; The trader will be long S1, short S2, short
S3, and long S4. &nbsp;For example, the trader may be long
the $100 call, short the $105 call, short the $110 call
and long the $115 call.&nbsp; Notice how each strike is
successively higher.&nbsp; It is not necessary to have them
separated by five points, though.&nbsp; You could construct
one with a long $100 call, short $110 call, short $120
call and long $130 call -- as long as the strikes are
evenly spaced.&nbsp; From a profit and loss standpoint, the
condor spread looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/074.gif'>

<p>The trader will maximize profit between the two short
strikes, $105 and $110 in this example.&nbsp; For stock
prices below $105 or above $110, the trader will start
to lose profits and eventually end up negative if the
stock falls below $101 (low break-even point) or rises
above $114 (the high break-even point).&nbsp; Any stock price
below $100 or above $115 produces the maximum loss of $1
-- the cost of the spread.</p>
<p>Notice how the condor is similar to a butterfly where
the trader buys a low strike, sells two medium strikes,
and buys one high strike.&nbsp; The condor is the same basic
pattern except the trader is splitting the two medium
strikes of the butterfly into two separate strikes.&nbsp;
This action creates a wider profit area relative to the
butterfly.&nbsp; The trader is hoping for a relatively stable
stock price.&nbsp; The following chart shows a comparison
between the condor and butterfly:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/075.gif'>

<p>Notice how the butterfly (blue) has a higher profit
but, in return, gets into loss territory quicker.&nbsp; The
condor (red) has a lower, but wider, profit area and
takes longer to head into losses.&nbsp; The markets realize
the condor is therefore more desirable and will bid its
price up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Again, market makers are probably the biggest users
of condors as they pay very little in commissions and
can make it worth their while to pay four commissions to
enter the condor and four to exit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Why do market makers use them?</p>
<p>To understand them, we need a refresher on
butterflies.&nbsp; If you read our section on butterfly
spreads, you will recall that market makers are actually
spreading spreads -- they buy the bull spread and sell
the bear spread.&nbsp; For example a basic call butterfly has
this pattern:</p>
<p><b><u>
Strike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125</u></b><br>
Call butterfly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1</p>
<p>In other words, the long butterfly trader is long the
$100 call, short 2 $105 calls and long the $110 call.&nbsp;
If the stock is at $105-1/2, the $100/$105 bull spread
(long $100, short $105) should be more valuable than the
$105/$110 bear spread (short $105 and long $110).&nbsp; If,
for some reason, the markets are pricing them equally,
market makers will buy the bull spread and sell the bear
spread making them long the butterfly.&nbsp; For the same
reasons traders buy spreads (buy one call and sell
another), traders will spread spreads, which is a
butterfly.</p>
<p>With condors, market makers are actually <i>laddering</i>
butterfly spreads; that is, they buy one set of
butterflies and buy a successively higher set of
butterflies.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><u>
Strike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125</u></b><br>
Call butterfly #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
<u>Call butterfly #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1</u><br>
Net position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 = condor
spread</p>
<p>A trader may see a theoretical discrepancy between
the $100/$105 bull and $105/$110 bear spread and want to
buy butterfly #1 above.&nbsp; In addition, there may be
another discrepancy between the $105/$110 bull and
$110/$115 bear, so they may desire to purchase that one
as well.&nbsp; With one condor, all pricing discrepancies
between the two butterflies are captured!</p>
<p>A short condor will be the mirror image of the long
position and, consequently, have opposing profits and
losses.&nbsp; Using the same example above, to execute a
short condor, the trader will be short $100 call, long
$105 call, long the $110 call, and short the $115 call.&nbsp;
The short condor looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/076.gif'>

<p>With the short condor, the trader will make maximum
profit if the stock makes a large move in either
direction.&nbsp; In this example, if the stock is below $109
or above $114, the break-even points, the trader will
keep the initial $1 credit.&nbsp; If the stock is between
$100 and $115, the position will start to lose profits,
and eventually end up at a maximum loss of $4 if the
stock is between $105 and $110 -- the strikes of the two
long positions.</p>
<h2>Albatross spread </h2>
<p>The basic long albatross is a strategy utilizing four
strikes just as the condor.&nbsp; However, the trader skips a
strike in the middle.&nbsp; Using the earlier notation, a
long condor trader will be long S1, short S2, short S3,
long S4, but skip a strike between S2 and S3.&nbsp; For
example, a trader who is long the $100 call, short $105,
short $115, long $120 is long an albatross spread.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint, the long albatross
looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/077.gif'>

<p>It has a wider but lower profit zone relative to the
condor.&nbsp; This reflects the relative risks of the two
strategies.&nbsp; All else equal, traders would prefer to
have wider ranges of profit so will bid this strategy
higher relative to the condor.&nbsp; This can be seen if we
overlay the two profit and loss diagrams:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/078.gif'>

<p>The trader will profit for any stock price above $102
and below $118, the break-even points.&nbsp; Maximum profit
will be realized for stock prices between $105 and
$115.&nbsp; Similar to the condor trader, a long albatross
position is betting on a fairly stable stock price;
however, the albatross trader has more room for error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As with the condor, the albatross is a continuation
of the laddering of butterfly spreads.&nbsp; For example, the
following chart shows the trader who is long an
albatross spread is effectively long the $105, $110 and
$115 butterflies.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><u>
Strike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125</u></b><br>
Call butterfly #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
Call butterfly #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
<u>Call butterfly
#3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1</u><br>
Net position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1
= albatross spread</p>
<p>The short albatross, of course, will be the opposite
of the long position.&nbsp; Here, the trader is betting on a
very large move, either up or down, in the underlying.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/079.gif'>

<h2>Pterodactyl spread</h2>
<p>As you probably guessed, the pterodactyl spread is
just a continuation of the albatross.&nbsp; It still involves
four strike prices but, this time, two strikes are
skipped in the middle.&nbsp; A trader who is long $100 call,
short $105 call, short $120 call, and long $125 call is
long a pterodactyl.&nbsp; The profit and loss diagram looks
like this:</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table10'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/080.gif'>

<p>The albatross trader has an even lower, but wider,
range of profits compared to the albatross.&nbsp; The trader,
in this example, will be profitable for any stock price
above $102 3/4 or below $117-1/4, the break-even
points.&nbsp; Maximum profit will be realized for stock
prices between $105 and $120.</p>
<p>As shown in the following chart, the pterodactyl
spread is a laddering of four butterfly spreads:</p>
<p><b><u>
Strike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125</u></b><br>
Call butterfly #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
Call butterfly #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
Call butterfly #3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1<br>
<u>Call butterfly
#4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1</u><br>
Net
position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1
= pterodactyl spread</p>
<p>Notice in the following chart how each spread -- the
condor, albatross, and pterodactyl -- reflects the
relative risks of each position.&nbsp; The strategy with the
highest profit potential will be the cheapest one to
purchase.&nbsp; Sometimes new traders find this confusing and
think the highest profit strategies should be the most
expensive, as those are the ones everybody wants and
will bid the price higher.&nbsp; This is incorrect, as the
highest profit strategies are also the riskiest.&nbsp; In
order to make them worth the risk, the market must
reduce the price.</p>
<table cellPadding='18' border='0' id='table11'>
<tr vAlign='top'>
<td>
<p align='center'>
<img width='300px' src='../images/081.gif'>

<p>Think of it this way: if all spreads were priced
equally, which would you prefer?&nbsp; Obviously, the
pterodactyl as it has the widest area for profit.&nbsp; So
traders will bid up the price of the pterodactyl
relative to the others.&nbsp; The same process will occur for
the albatross and the condor.&nbsp; No matter how
sophisticated you become with option trading, you will
never be able to avoid the risk-reward relationships.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Spreads are great trading tools and you should take
the time to become familiar with these advanced
combinations.&nbsp; In most cases, these are better suited
for market makers but that doesn't mean they cannot be
used at the retail level.&nbsp; If you plan to use one, be
sure to evaluate your break-even points and maximum
gains and losses taking commissions into account.</p>
