<h1>Fair Value</h1>

<h2>Futures Markets</h2>
<p>You may have heard financial sources, such as CNBC,
talk about the futures quotes prior to the market open.&nbsp;
Advanced market participants will watch the futures
trading to get an idea of where the market will open.&nbsp;
However, even advanced traders get confused as to
exactly what this means.&nbsp; Often they associate the
change in futures prices as the indication.&nbsp; For
example, if the futures are trading up 20, many
mistakenly believe this mean a positive indication for
the open.&nbsp; Likewise, they feel if the futures are
trading down 10, that the markets will open negatively.</p>
<p>While it may appear to make sense, this
interpretation can get you into trouble especially if
you are trading in pre-market based on the indication.&nbsp;
In order to understand how to interpret the quote, you
need to understand a concept called &quot;fair value.&quot;</p>
<p>Before we can talk about fair value, we need to
understand some basic mechanics of the futures markets.&nbsp;
When you buy a futures contract, you are entering into
an agreement to buy and take delivery of a commodity (or
financial future) at a future date.&nbsp; This sometimes
confuses people who are new to futures but you've
probably entered into similar agreements although not
specifically futures contracts.&nbsp; For example, if you
have a contractor build a house or a car dealer order a
car.&nbsp; You agree to take delivery at a future date and
exchange cash at that time.&nbsp; The important thing to keep
in mind is that, with futures contracts, the buys and
sells are locked in!&nbsp; This is very different from the
options market where the buyer has the right, but not
the obligation to purchase.&nbsp; If you buy a futures
contract, you must purchase the goods.&nbsp; If you sell a
futures contract, you must deliver the goods.&nbsp; Of
course, if you do want to get out of your obligation,
you can execute a reversing contract just like in the
options market.</p>
<p>Futures markets are used as hedging tools for both
buyers and sellers.&nbsp; For example, a farmer would
probably be a seller of wheat futures.&nbsp; He can grow the
crops today and know in advance what his price will be
at harvest.&nbsp; Likewise, Kellogg would probably be a buyer
of wheat futures to lock in their purchase price of
wheat for use in cereal.</p>
<p>The financial futures (SPX and NDX among others) are
used for similar purposes.&nbsp; They allow fund managers to
hedge portfolios.&nbsp; There are four contract months, each
is the last month of the quarter.&nbsp; So, the contracts are
March (represented by the letter &quot;H&quot;), June (M),
September (U) and December (Z).&nbsp; Whenever you hear CNBC
quoting fair value, they are always talking about the
near-term contract.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Review</h2>
<p>Fair value is the relationship between the index
(also called the &quot;spot&quot;) and the corresponding futures
contract.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the fundamental
value of the companies representing the index.&nbsp; Fair
value tells us what the value of a futures contract
&quot;should be.&quot;&nbsp; But, because futures trade on separate
markets from the spot market, they are subjected to
their own sets of supply and demand so may wander off in
different directions from the stock market.&nbsp; In fact,
the futures trade all night long on GLOBEX, from 4:45pm
until 9:15 am EST.&nbsp; But, if the futures get too far out
of line, the arbitrageurs will correct for that prior to
the opening bell.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp; Fair value is nothing more than
the cost to carry the index to delivery to the future.&nbsp;
What do we mean by cost of carry?&nbsp; It is the interest
that could be earned on money in a risk-free asset such
as a money market or T-bill.&nbsp; So, if you have an asset
that costs $100 and must <i>carry </i>it for one year,
your cost would be $10 if interest rates were 10%; this
is the amount of money forgone by not having the money
in the risk-free asset.</p>
<p>To simplify things, let's look at a simple commodity
such as gold and assume the following:</p>
<p><b>Gold price:&nbsp; $200<br>
Interest rate:&nbsp; 10%<br>
1-year futures contract:&nbsp; $250</b></p>
<p>If you buy this futures contract, you are saying you
will buy gold for $250 per ounce in one year.&nbsp; The
person who sells this contract is saying they will sell
gold for $250 per ounce in one year.&nbsp; Of course, as
things change (i.e., supply and demand for gold, time
remaining on contract etc.) so will the price of this
contract.</p>
<p><b>Fair value to carry the gold is $200 * (1.10) =
$220.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>If you <i>borrowed</i> $200 to buy the gold, it would
cost you $20 in interest; if you bought it with your own
money, you would miss out on $20 in interest.&nbsp; So,
either way you look at it, there is a $20 cost to buy
the gold and hold for one year.</p>
<p>Because the 1-year futures contract is <u>above</u>
the fair value, arbitrage is possible.</p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i>&nbsp; In order for a transaction to
qualify as arbitrage, two conditions must be met:&nbsp; (1)
The transactions must guarantee a profit (2) there can
be no initial cash outlay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second condition is
necessary otherwise the straight purchase of a
government bond would qualify as arbitrage since profit
is guaranteed</i>.</p>
<p>With the fair value above the spot price,
arbitrageurs will take the following strategy:</p>
<p><b><u>Today</u></b><br>
Borrow $200:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$200<br>
Buy gold in spot market:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$200<br>
Sell the futures contract:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</u><br>
Net cash outlay:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p><b><u>1 year later</u></b><br>
Deliver the gold against futures contract and
receive:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$250<br>
Pay the interest from loan ($200 +
10%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>-$220</u><br>
for an arbitrage profit of
$30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$30</p>
<p>This is an arbitrage profit because there was no
initial cash outlay to acquire the asset but we <u>
guaranteed our selling price</u> by selling the futures
contract.</p>
<p>Traders will buy the spot and carry it to the future
thus creating their own futures contract.&nbsp; This is
called &quot;cash and carry&quot; arbitrage.&nbsp; These actions will
put buying pressure on the spot price and selling
pressure on the futures contract, which will eventually
eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.</p>
<p><b>In a perfect market, any futures price above $220
will result in cash and carry arbitrage.</b></p>
<p>What if the futures price is too low?&nbsp; Assume the
following prices:</p>
<p><b>Spot price:&nbsp; $230<br>
Interest rate:&nbsp; 10%<br>
1-year futures contract:&nbsp; $250</b></p>
<p>Fair value = $230 * (1.10) = $253</p>
<p>In this case, the futures contract is below fair
value.&nbsp; It &quot;should be&quot; priced at $253 but is only $250
so arbitrageurs will do the following strategy:</p>
<p><b><u>Today</u></b><br>
Sell short gold:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$230<br>
Lend proceeds at 10%:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>-$230</u><br>
Buy the futures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p><b><u>1 year later</u></b><br>
Take delivery of the spot through futures <br>
contract and cover short position:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$250<br>
Collect proceeds from loan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$253</u><br>
For arbitrage profit
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3</p>
<p>Notice that this is arbitrage because there was no
cash outlay at beginning.&nbsp; We guaranteed the profit with
the purchase of the futures contract.&nbsp; These actions
should put buying pressure on the futures contract and
selling pressure on the spot market, which will
eventually eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.</p>
<p><b>In a perfect market, <u>any</u> futures price
below fair value will result in this &quot;reverse cash and
carry arbitrage.&quot;</b></p>
<p>Remember, if the futures price is above fair value,
arbitrageurs will <u>buy the spot</u>.&nbsp; If the futures
price is below fair value, they will <u>sell the spot</u>.</p>
<p>We have seen how traders can arbitrage when futures
are too high or too low.&nbsp; The only time they cannot
arbitrage is when the futures contract is priced at the
cost of carry -- the fair value!</p>
<h2>Market Imperfections</h2>
<p>We just showed that arbitrage is theoretically
possible if the futures contract is either above or
below fair value.&nbsp; However, in the real world, there are
many imperfections that make arbitrage impossible even
though the futures contract may be higher or lower than
fair value.&nbsp; Some of these imperfections are:</p>
<p>1) Transaction Costs<br>
2) Bid/Ask spreads<br>
3) Restrictions on short sales<br>
4) Different borrowing/lending rates<br>
5) Execution risk<br>
6) Lack of storability (for non-financial commodities)</p>
<p><b>Because of these imperfections, arbitrage may
disappear even though the futures are not priced at
their fair value.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>For example, assume the following but with a 3%
transaction cost:<br>
<b>Gold price:&nbsp; $200<br>
Interest rate:&nbsp; 10%<br>
1-year futures contract:&nbsp; $225<br>
Transaction costs:&nbsp; 3%</b></p>
<p>We know that fair value is $200 * (1.10) = $220 and
the futures price is $225 so it appears that arbitrage
is possible.&nbsp; Let's see if it is:</p>
<p><b><u>Today</u></b><br>
Borrow $206&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$206<br>
Buy gold in spot market ($200 + 3%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$206<br>
Sell the futures contract:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</u><br>
Net cash
outlay:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p><b><u>1 year later</u></b><br>
Deliver the gold to make delivery of futures
contract:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$225.00<br>
Pay the interest from loan ($206 +
10%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<u>$226.60</u><br>
For net
loss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$1.60</p>
<p>Now, because of transaction costs, the arbitrage
situation is eliminated.&nbsp; In this example, the futures
would have to be priced at $226.60 or higher to execute
a &quot;cash and carry&quot; arbitrage.</p>
<p>Using the above example but with futures priced too
low, what happens with a 3% transaction cost?</p>
<p><b>Gold price:&nbsp;&nbsp;$200<br>
Interest rate:&nbsp;&nbsp;10%<br>
1-year futures contract:&nbsp;&nbsp;$215<br>
Transaction costs:&nbsp;&nbsp;3%</b></p>
<p>We know that fair value is $200 * (1.10) = $220 so it
appears the futures contract is priced too low at $215.&nbsp;
Arbitrageurs will attempt to arbitrage by executing a
reverse cash and carry.</p>
<p><b><u>Today</u></b><br>
Sell short gold:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$194 (sell at $200 less a
3% transaction cost) <br>
Lend at 10%:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$194<br>
Buy the $215 futures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</u><br>
Net cash outlay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0</p>
<p><b><u>1 year later</u></b><br>
Take delivery of the spot through<br>
futures contract and cover short position:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$215.00<br>
Collect proceeds from loan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$213.40</u><br>
For net
loss:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$1.60</p>
<p>With the spot at $200, the futures contract would
have to trade below $200*(0.97)*(1.1) = $213.40 before
arbitrage could be implemented.&nbsp; So, with 3% transaction
costs, the futures must trade in the range of&nbsp; $213.40
and $226.60 before arbitrage can be successful. </p>
<p><b>Any futures price inside this range results in NO
arbitrage.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>An easier way to state this is that if the spread
(the difference between the futures and spot) is above
$26.60 or below $13.40 then arbitrage will occur.</p>
<p>For instance, using the above example with the spot
at $200 and the futures at $215, the spread would be
$215 - $200 = $15.&nbsp; Because $15 lies between the &quot;no
arbitrage&quot; bounds of $13.40 and $26.60, then no
arbitrage can occur.</p>
<p>Often you will hear sources refer to &quot;buy and sell
program&quot; values.&nbsp; This is exactly what the buy and sell
programs tell us.&nbsp; If an index has buy programs at
$26.60 and sell programs at $13.40, then if the spread
(the difference between the futures and spot) rises
above $26.60 the arbitrageurs will <u>buy the index</u>
and sell the futures for a guaranteed profit.&nbsp; This
creates buying pressure on the index, which is why it is
labeled as &quot;buy.&quot;&nbsp; If the spread falls below $13.40,
then arbitrageurs will <u>short the index</u> and buy
the futures for a guaranteed profit.&nbsp; This causes
selling pressure on the index and is therefore labeled
&quot;sell.&quot;</p>
<p>So, the futures are allowed to wander within an
&quot;invisible fence&quot; around the fair value as shown in the
chart below.&nbsp; <i>The fence is created by the transaction
costs and other market imperfections listed above.</i>&nbsp;
Again, any spread within this fence results in no
arbitrage.</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/021.gif'>

<p>Also notice that the number of points above and below
fair value is the same.&nbsp; In the above example, fair
value is $220 with buy programs at $26.60 and sell at
$13.40.&nbsp; This is 6.6 points above and below the $20 fair
value.&nbsp; Assuming equal transaction costs on the buy and
sell programs, the number of points above and below fair
value will always be equal.</p>
<p><b>It is important to keep in mind that it is the
spread (the difference between the futures and spot)
that counts.</b></p>
<p>In the above example, the spread must expand to
$26.60 or higher before the sell programs start.&nbsp; The
spread can increase by several cases such as: (1) the
futures can increase while the spot stays the same (2)
the spot can decrease while futures stays same (3)
futures rise and spot falls (4) futures and spot rise
but futures rise at a <i>faster</i> rate.</p>
<p>This shows that program trading (arbitrage) does not
necessarily guarantee a correction toward fair value.&nbsp;
If the futures and spot are both rising, but the futures
is <i>rising at a faster rate</i> then the index may
stay in sell territory for extended periods of time,
possibly the entire day.&nbsp; As long as the spread remains
outside the upper arbitrage bounds, sell programs will
continue.&nbsp; In a similar but opposite way, buy programs
can exist for extended times.&nbsp; If the spread shrinks
(i.e., the spot market is falling faster than the
futures), then buy programs will continue.</p>
<h2>How Is Fair Value Calculated?</h2>
<p>Now that you understand that fair value is nothing
more than the cost of carry of the underlying asset,
there is just one adjustment you need to make to fully
understand how fair value is calculated for the S&amp;P 500
(SPX) or Nasdaq (NDX) futures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you buy all the stocks in the index on margin and
carry them to the future (cash and carry arbitrage) you
will receive some dividends, which offsets your cost of
carry.&nbsp; So, if the risk-free rate is 5% and you receive
3% in dividends, effectively your cost of carry is
(5%-3%) = 2%.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Futures contract * (1+ (interest - dividends) ) ^
days/360</b></p>
<p>And that is the formula for Fair Value!</p>
<p><b>Example:&nbsp; </b>Say the NDX index closed last night
at 3465.&nbsp; The futures closed at 3490.&nbsp; However, the
futures traded throughout the night and are now trading
at 3550.&nbsp; Also assume that fair value calculations put
fair value at 3550.&nbsp; What does this imply for the
opening of the Nasdaq market?</p>
<p>The futures are currently 3550 but closed at 3490 so
the futures will be <u>indicating UP 60 points</u> (3550
- 3490).&nbsp; But, the fair value formula says the futures
&quot;should be&quot; trading at 3550 so they are, in essence,
priced fairly.&nbsp; This is actually a neutral or flat
indication for the opening even though the futures are
up.&nbsp; The futures may be up from their closing price the
day before, but they are currently trading for fair
value. </p>
<p><b>Most Important Concept!</b></p>
<p>Here is where most people get tripped up when looking
at futures quotes.&nbsp; Say we use the same example above
but now, instead, the futures are trading for 3495.&nbsp;
Here, the futures closed at 3490 but are now trading for
3495 so the quote will show the futures up 5.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>KEY POINT:&nbsp; If you get nothing else from all this,
please understand that just because the futures are UP
that this, in itself, does not tell you the indication
for the opening of the market.&nbsp; You need to know where
fair value is.</p>
<p>Likewise, just because the futures quote is down does
not mean that it is a negative indication for the
market.</b></p>
<p>In this second example, the futures are trading for
3495 but &quot;should be,&quot; based on the fair value
calculation, trading for 3500.&nbsp; In essence, they are
still cheap even though their price increased
overnight.&nbsp; Arbitrageurs will buy the futures and sell
the spot.&nbsp; So, even though the futures are up, in this
case, it is actually a negative indication for the
market!</p>
<p>The concept of fair value is of little use for retail
investors other than to satisfy their curiosity as to
the direction of the market at the opening bell.&nbsp; Where
many investors get in trouble is to either buy or sell
in the pre-market (such as selectnet) based on the
futures quote.&nbsp; Before you base your decisions on the
futures quote, make sure you know where it is in
relation to fair value.&nbsp; It is only then that you will
truly know the expectation of the market on the opening
bell.</p>
