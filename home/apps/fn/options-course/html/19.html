<h1>Put-Call Ratio</h1>

<p>Technical analysis is quickly becoming widespread as
an active trader tool.&nbsp; Used only by professionals just
a few years ago, this same information is available to
nearly everybody through the World Wide Web.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Technical indicators try to predict market turns;
that is, at what point a stock or index will rise or
fall.&nbsp; If we knew these points, the gains could be
unimaginable so the incentive is certainly there for
investors to try to figure out where these points are.</p>
<p>Of all technical indicators, the put-call ratio is
probably the most recognized that uses options as its
focal point.</p>
<p>From a mathematical standpoint, the calculation of
the put-call ratio is very easy.&nbsp; It is the total volume
for all put contracts divided by the total volume of
call contracts traded on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE).</p>
<p><b>Put-call ratio = Total CBOE put volume / Total
CBOE call volume</b></p>
<p>The indicator suggests that a market <u>downturn</u>
is threatening when the put-call ratio hits a <u>low</u>
level and vice versa. &nbsp;The rationale is quite simple:
most speculators of options are unsophisticated and
typically will be lured to buy calls when the market is
at a top, and buy puts when the market is at a bottom.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If speculators start to buy a high number of call
options relative to puts, the indicator decreases
(because you are dividing by a larger number) and it is
read as a negative indicator.&nbsp; Likewise, if speculators
are loading up on puts, the ratio increases and it
becomes a bullish reading.&nbsp; Because the put-call
indicator works in a backward fashion (bullish indicator
when markets bearish and vice versa), it is called a <i>
contrarian</i> indicator.</p>
<p>Where these &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; points are is a matter
of debate.&nbsp; There are many interpretations and many
traders and technical analysis firms that make small
modifications to the formula to meet their specific
needs.&nbsp; But as a general rule, a level of 80 is bullish
and 45 is bearish.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that no technical indicator is perfect
by any means!&nbsp; So do not speculate just because the
indicator is giving a particular reading.&nbsp; Use it in
conjunction with other information and your own
opinions.</p>
<p>There are two important points to remember when using
the put-call ratio.&nbsp; First, remember it is a contrarian
indicator.&nbsp; There are many novice traders who have been
burned by buying puts just because the indicator was
high; they should have been buying calls.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Second, put-call ratio is much harder to interpret
now with sophisticated traders and the use of
synthetics.&nbsp; If a trader buys a put, it will get
calculated as a bearish position by the put-call ratio.&nbsp;
But what if the trader is buying a put as protection for
a long stock position?&nbsp; Now he is certainly bullish and
should be counted as so.&nbsp; Likewise, someone selling puts
would be counted towards the bullish side (selling puts
by themselves is bullish).&nbsp; But if this investor were
selling puts against short stock, they should be counted
as bearish because they are now synthetic short calls.&nbsp;
So in theory, the indicator may be of significance.&nbsp; The
reality is, unless you know <i>how</i> the investor is
using the put or call, the indicator is highly
uncertain.</p>
