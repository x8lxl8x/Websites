<h1>Long Put</h1>

<h2>Long and short puts</h2>
<p>A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the
obligation, to <i>sell</i> stock for a fixed price over
a given amount of time.&nbsp; It is the put buyer, also
called the long position, who has the right to sell
stock.&nbsp; The short put seller, on the other side of the
trade, has the obligation to purchase stock if the long
position exercises their option.&nbsp; There should be no
concern for default by the short side as the Options
Clearing Corporation (OCC) guarantees the performance of
the contract.</p>
<p>The long put strategy is therefore bearish, as the
value of the put rises with decreases in the underlying
stock.&nbsp; Please understand when we say that the put will
rise if the underlying falls, that is assuming all other
factors remain the same.&nbsp; It is entirely possible for
the put to fall in value even though the underlying is
falling, but this is usually due to changes in other
factors such as time or volatility.</p>
<p>Investors are typically attracted to the long put
strategy for two main reasons:</p>
<p>1) Leverage<br>
2) Protection (hedge)</p>
<p>Long put options provide more leverage than short
stock for speculators who are bearish.&nbsp; In other words,
for a given dollar investment, the return on investment
for the owner of a put option is much higher as compared
to the investor who shorts stock.&nbsp; However, this
leverage works both ways.&nbsp; The long put owner may lose
100% of their investment with just a small adverse move,
whereas the short seller will lose only a small
fraction.</p>
<h2>Example:&nbsp; </h2>
<p>You are bearish on Intel (INTC) currently trading for
$31-3/4.&nbsp; Let's compare a short seller with a long put
buyer.</p>
<p>With short sales, there is usually more leverage than
with the purchase of stock.&nbsp; The reason is that most
speculators will only post the required Reg T amount of
50%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If a speculator wants to short 1,000 INTC, they would
need to post a minimum of 50%, so the total credit would
be $31-3/4 * 1.5 * 1,000 = $47,625.&nbsp; Remember, when you
short stock, you receive a credit; you will purchase the
stock later for a debit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The accounting looks like this:</p>
<p>Credit = $47,625<br>
MVS&nbsp; = <u>&nbsp;$31,750</u><br>
Equity &nbsp;&nbsp; $15,875</p>
<p>Notice that your equity is $15,875 and when divided
by the market value short of $31,750 gives you 50%
equity, which is the Reg T amount.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's assume the stock falls to $25 per share.&nbsp; Now
the account looks like this:</p>
<p>Credit = $47,625<br>
MVS&nbsp; = <u>&nbsp;$25,000</u><br>
Equity &nbsp;&nbsp; $22,625</p>
<p>Notice that the credit balance does not change; it is
simply cash sitting in the account.&nbsp; The market value
short (MVS) will change which will change your equity.&nbsp;
If the MVS falls, your equity will rise and vice versa.</p>
<p>The stock fell, in this example, about 21% from $31
3/4 to $25 giving the investor a 42% increase in equity
from $15,875 to $22,625.&nbsp; The reason the investor
doubled the move of the stock is because they only
posted 50% of the requirement which doubles the
leverage.</p>
<p>Let's look at the puts now.&nbsp; A March $30 put is $1
1/4 and an investor could instead elect to purchase 10
contracts to control 1,000 shares and pay only $1 1/4 *
10 * 100 = $1,250.&nbsp; Later, with the stock at $25, the
$30 put will be worth at least $5 (more if there is some
time remaining on the option).&nbsp; Here the investor paid
$1 1/4 but sells for $5 (and maybe more) for a minimum
300% increase.</p>
<h2>Leverage</h2>
<p>Your return on the short stock is 42% (not
annualized) while the return on the option is 300% (not
annualized).&nbsp; This is what they mean by leverage.&nbsp; The
investor who bought the put options, in this example,
has a return on investment that is over 7 times higher
as compared to the short stock trader.</p>
<h2>Protection</h2>
<p>What if the stock rises substantially?&nbsp; The short
stock position has an unlimited amount of risk as a
stock can keep rising without bounds.&nbsp; The long put
holder, however, is only at risk for the $1 1/4 points
regardless of how high the stock moves.&nbsp; Therefore, the
long put holder also gets a &quot;peace of mind&quot; by holding
the option; they know the maximum loss up front.</p>
<p>As with call options, one must be careful in
interpreting return on investment.&nbsp; In the above
example, the option trader had a much higher return on
investment (300% vs. 42%).&nbsp; However, the short stock
position has <u>more dollars</u>.&nbsp; The short stock
seller gained $6,750 while the option trader gained
$3,875.&nbsp; This will always be the case, as the put buyer
must pay some sort of premium.&nbsp; The smaller the premium,
the more the total dollars will match that with the
stock trader.</p>
<h2>Profit and loss diagram</h2>

<img width='300px' src='../images/030.gif'>

<p>We can see the effect of the protection by the profit
and loss diagram above (if you are not sure how to read
this chart, please see our section under &quot;Profit and
Loss Diagrams&quot;).&nbsp; Again, the most the option investor
can lose is the $1,250 paid for the 10 put contracts.&nbsp;
Yet, they participate in all of the downside moves below
the $30 strike price.</p>
<p>This added upside protection does not come for free.&nbsp;
We can also see that the break-even point is lowered
from $30 to $28-3/4 for the put buyer.</p>
<p>Long puts can also be used as an &quot;insurance policy&quot;
against long stock.&nbsp; Say you own 1,000 shares of Intel
so your total position is worth $31,750, but you fear it
may fall in the short term.&nbsp; You can purchase 10 of the
$30 strike puts for $1-1/4 (which raises the cost basis
of your long shares by the same amount), and be hedged
for all prices below $30.&nbsp; For example, assume the stock
falls to $25.&nbsp; Your stock is now worth $25,000, which is
down $6,750.&nbsp; But your long $30 put is worth at least
$5,000.&nbsp; At expiration, you can elect to do one of two
things:(1) hang on to your stock and sell the put for
$5,000; this will help to offset the $6,250 loss, or (2)
Exercise your put and sell your shares for $30.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that the put, at expiration, is worth $5,000
yet the long stock position was down $6,750 for a
difference of $1,250.&nbsp; This is the cost of the put, and
it will never be recouped.</p>
<p>Long puts can be especially useful if you trade
stocks on margin and are close to a maintenance call.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is worth a little bit of money to insure
yourself from a forced sale of your stock.</p>
<p>If you didn't want to spend $1-1/4 for the put
option, you may decide to buy a lower strike put such as
the $25 strike.&nbsp; The $25 will be cheaper than the $30
because you are, in effect, assuming a $5 point
deductible as compared to the $30 strike.&nbsp; In other
words, protection with the $25 strike will not start
until the stock is trading below $25.&nbsp; As with any
insurance policy, the higher the deductible, the lower
the premium.</p>
<h2>Short puts</h2>
<p>The strategy behind the <u>naked</u> (or uncovered)
put is neutral to bullish.&nbsp; The investor is betting that
the stock will either rise or sit still.&nbsp; Another
strategy for short put sellers is to use short puts as a
way to purchase stock.&nbsp; In other words, it changes the
scope of the investment if you are selling puts on stock
you want to purchase anyway.&nbsp; Selling puts against stock
that you don't mind owning is similar to getting paid to
place buy limit orders below the current market.</p>
<p>For example, using the above INTC prices, say you
want to purchase shares of Intel, but you think it may
fall to $28 in the short term.&nbsp; Many investors would
place a buy order with a limit of $28 and just hope it
hits.&nbsp; If it doesn't, they have completely missed any
profitable opportunity.&nbsp; Compare this to the short put
seller.&nbsp; The short put seller may want to purchase the
stock, but is afraid it may fall to $28.&nbsp; This investor
sells the $30 put for $1-1/4.&nbsp; Now, if the stock rises,
at least this investor receives $1-1/4.&nbsp; If the stock
falls to $28 at expiration, the short put seller will be
forced to buy a $28 stock for $30; however, they
received $1-1/4 for it, which makes their cost basis
$28-3/4.&nbsp; Granted, their cost basis is a little higher
than the investor who used the limit order.&nbsp; But the
limit order will have zero profit if the stock rises;
they miss out on all opportunities.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using short puts as a way to purchase stock you want
to own can be a tough strategy to beat!</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint, the short put
looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/031.gif'>

<p>We see the maximum this investor can make is the
$1-1/4 points from the sale.&nbsp; But if the stock falls,
the investor starts heading into losses.&nbsp; Keep in mind
that if you are willing to purchase the stock
regardless, then it's difficult to say these are truly
losses, at least when compared to a speculator who sells
puts with the intention of never buying the stock.&nbsp; The
short put seller who intends to purchase the stock is,
in fact, potentially deferring the purchase but getting
paid if it rises.&nbsp; If the stock falls, he may be forced
to buy stock, but he was going to purchase it anyway.&nbsp;
Now, the big tradeoff with the short put selling for
stock you want to buy is this: the stock may take off to
the upside, and you're left with only the premium from
the put.</p>
<p>An alternative hedging strategy is to do the
following: Buy half the amount of shares you are willing
to purchase and sell puts on half the shares.&nbsp; Using the
above Intel example, if you are willing to purchase
1,000 INTC today, maybe just buy 500 shares and sell $5
for the $30 puts.&nbsp; Now, if the stock moves higher, you
will profit on the 500 shares plus the premium from the
puts.&nbsp; If it moves down, you were willing to assume this
risk anyway, but now you've lowered your cost basis by
$1-1/4 on the additional 500 shares.</p>
<p>Put options are great tools for hedging.&nbsp; However, be
careful in using puts as an ongoing form of insurance.&nbsp;
The reason is due to the relatively high costs of puts.&nbsp;
It's not uncommon to see put option premiums reach 20%
(or more) of the underlying stock price on an annualized
basis.&nbsp; Historically, stocks have returned about 12% per
year so if you use puts as a continuous form of
insurance, you'll be losing at an annual rate of about
8%.&nbsp; Instead, use puts for specific points in time that
concern you such as upcoming earnings reports or other
announcements that may affect your stock.&nbsp; If you want
to speculate on stock prices, using puts may be a better
bet than shorting stock once you understand all the
risks.</p>
