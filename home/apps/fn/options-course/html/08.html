<h1>Early Exercise</h1>

<p>Call options allow the buyer to purchase stock at a
specified price over a specified time.&nbsp; However, there
are two types of call options, one known as <i>American
style</i> and the other known as <i>European style</i>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>An American style option allows the buyer to exercise
early while the European counterpart requires the buyer
to wait until option expiration before purchasing stock
with the call option.&nbsp; The question now is this: Is it
ever advantageous to exercise an American style call
option early; that is, prior to expiration?</p>
<p>The answer will be very obvious to you once we go
through some analogies, but surprisingly, this is one of
the most common sources of option errors. </p>
<p>If you trade options, be sure you understand this
section, as it will keep you from making one of the
costliest mistakes in option trading.</p>
<h2>Exercising early</h2>
<p>Let's start with the answer and then we will show why
it is true:</p>
<h2>It is never optimal to exercise a call option early
<i>except</i> to capture a dividend.</h2>
<p>There are many ways to show this is true.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, most of the methods involve fairly
complicated methods comparing two different portfolios
of stocks and options,then comparing them after early
exercise to see if one portfolio has an advantage over
the other.&nbsp; I don't particularly like these methods as
proofs for most investors, as they can get complicated,
but we will show you one of these methods at the end
anyway.&nbsp; For now, let's show why you should never
exercise a call option early (except to capture a
dividend) by using a simple story.</p>
<p>Say your broker calls you one day with a hot deal.&nbsp;
He has 1,000 shares of ABC stock that he must get rid
of.&nbsp; The stock has moved up sharply over the past couple
of weeks, from $30 to the current price of $75.&nbsp; He
tells you, &quot;This is the hottest stock on the market and
is certain to move higher.&nbsp; If you buy it now, I will
not charge you a commission.&quot;</p>
<p>You think it doesn't sound like such a bad deal.&nbsp; You
have been hearing about the company in the news lately
and were thinking of buying shares anyway.&nbsp; You tell
your broker, &quot;I do not like to make these kinds of
decisions in such a short time.&nbsp; I'd really like to
research the stock to see exactly what this company
does.&quot;</p>
<p>Because you have been a customer of the brokerage
firm for so long, the broker makes you this final
offer.&nbsp; &quot;I will give you 10 days to research the stock
and, if you decide that you want to buy it, I will
reserve the shares for you at the current price of $75.&nbsp;
If, after 10 days, you decide you do not want them, just
let me know and I will not charge you anything.&quot;</p>
<p>On your first day of research, you come to the
conclusion that this company will be bigger than
Microsoft and Intel combined.&nbsp; You will be wealthy
beyond your wildest dreams if you could just purchase
this stock.&nbsp; You must have the shares!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, here's the question: Do you call your broker
after the first day and buy the shares?&nbsp; Remember that
he has given you 10 days to make up your mind and will
reserve the $75 price for you.</p>
<p>Hopefully you realize the answer -- you wait until
the tenth day.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; There are two reasons.&nbsp; One,
because the brokerage firm is holding the stock and they
are the ones at risk!&nbsp; If the stock falls, you will just
tell your broker you don't want the shares at $75, as
you will just purchase them in the market yourself. </p>
<p>Second, as with any payment, you should prefer to pay
as late as possible so that you can earn interest on
your money in the meantime. Your purchase price will be
$75,000 regardless of whether you buy today or on the
tenth day.&nbsp; The answer is clear; you wait as long as
possible and call your broker on the tenth day to
purchase the stock.</p>
<p>This example may seem blatantly obvious -- almost
absurd -- as to the correct answer.&nbsp; But don't laugh;
many advanced option traders make this mistake every
single day.&nbsp; The situation we just described above <u>is</u>
a call option and many traders, mistakenly, elect to
call the shares away early.</p>
<p>How is it a call option?&nbsp; Think about what your
rights are with a call.&nbsp; You have the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase stock for a fixed price over a
specified time frame.&nbsp; In the example above, you had the
right with no obligation to purchase the shares for $75
for a period of ten days.&nbsp; The reason the example seemed
absurd is because you were not required to pay any fees
for the privilege of locking in the $75 price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In fact, if your broker required you to pay a fee,
you would exactly have a call option (technically it
would be called a <i>forward agreement</i> since the
&quot;call option&quot; was not purchased as a standardized
contract).</p>

<h2>Insights Into Option Pricing</h2>
<p>If your broker did decide to take a fee
for the arrangement, is there a price where
he must accept?&nbsp; Yes, and that price is
$75.&nbsp; At $75, you have effectively removed
all risk to the brokerage firm so they would
have no reason to not accept this bid.&nbsp; In
fact, if you read our section on &quot;Option
Pricing Basics&quot; during week 5, you will see
that the highest price a call can trade is
the price of the stock and now you know
why.&nbsp; This is also why buy-writes (buying
stock and selling calls simultaneously) must
be entered as a net debit because the price
of the option can never exceed the price of
the stock.</div>

<h2>Why traders feel they must exercise early</h2>
<p>Traders who exercise early make the mistake of not
realizing exactly what is happening in a call option
agreement.&nbsp; Often, this is how they view the situation.&nbsp;
Say the trader purchases a $100 call option for $15.&nbsp;
The stock is now $130 with over a month left of time.&nbsp;
The option is trading for $32.&nbsp; Here is the mistake: The
trader often feels he does not want to &quot;lose&quot; the value
of the call option.&nbsp; So, before the market gets the best
of him, he decides to exercise it and walk away the
winner.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; Remember that the trader is <u>locked
into the price</u> of $100.&nbsp; The stock can be trading
for $200 and have split twice by expiration, and the
stock price is still $100 to the owner of the call
option.&nbsp; If he exercises early, however, the stock could
completely collapse and he would have been better off
not exercising.&nbsp; Also, by not exercising early, the $100
stays in the money market longer to earn more interest.</p>
<p>So what should you do if you feel your option is
really high in value and you want to get out before it
falls?&nbsp; Sell the call to close.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In this example,
the trader exercised early and received stock worth
$130, but paid only $100 for a gain of $30.&nbsp; After
subtracting the cost of the call, $15, his net gain is
$15.&nbsp; But if he sold the call to close in the market, he
would receive $32 for a net gain of $17 after
subtracting out the $15 cost.&nbsp; In other words, if you
exercise your call option, you will only receive the
stock in exchange for the strike price; you receive only
the <u>intrinsic</u> amount.&nbsp; If you sell the call to
close, you will collect the intrinsic amount <u>plus the
time premium</u>.&nbsp; <b>You will always be better off
selling the call to close if you do not want to continue
holding the call option.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>The last thing you want to hold is the stock; that is
the reason you buy the call option in the first place!</p>

<h2>Trading Example</h2>
<p>One day a trader called in complaining
after viewing his balances on the computer
that morning.&nbsp; His net worth on the account
was $120,000. It was $124,000 the day before
yet all of his stocks were trading about the
same price or a little higher.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After searching through the transactions,
it was discovered that he exercised 10 calls
the day before.&nbsp; The option was 20 points
in-the-money but the call was selling for
$24 the previous day.&nbsp; When he exercised,
the four points of time premium were wasted
and that's what happened to his $4,000!&nbsp; If
he had sold the contracts to close the
previous day, his balance would still have
been $124,000.</p>
<p>Remember, when you exercise a call, you
only receive the difference between the
stock price and the exercise price; if you
sell the call to close, you receive that
same amount <u>plus</u> some time premium.</div>

<h2>Still not convinced?</h2>
<p>If you are still not sure whether or not that you
should exercise a call option early, think about this
scenario.&nbsp; Say a trader has a covered call position and
bought stock at $100 per share and sold a 1-year $100
call for $25.&nbsp; Now, if they get assigned, they will lose
the stock but make a 33% profit (effectively buying the
stock for $75 and selling it for $100 a year later).&nbsp; An
investor who enters this trade considers the 33% profit
a good deal, based on the risk of the stock, for one
year's time.</p>
<p>Now, think about this, what is the best thing that
could happen to this trader?&nbsp; The best thing would be
for him to check his account the next day and see the
stock called away.&nbsp; Now he has received 33% in a day
instead of a year, which is a much better return (too
big to print!).&nbsp; Well, if it's a better deal for the
short call position to be called early, it must be an
equally bad deal for the long call.&nbsp; This is because
options are a zero-sum game; that is, the one trader's
gains are <i>exactly</i> the other trader's losses.</p>
<p>Because the long call has control, that investor will
do what is best for him -- he will wait until the very
end of the year to exercise the call and receive the
stock.</p>
<h2>Mathematical models</h2>
<p>It was mentioned at the beginning that we would look
at a mathematical model in addition to the simplistic
proofs covered so far.&nbsp; Here, we will look at one of
many mathematical proofs that show it is never optimal
to exercise a call option early on a non-dividend paying
stock.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Consider two portfolios, A and B. </p>
<p>Portfolio A:&nbsp; Present value of exercise price in cash
+ call option</p>
<p>Portfolio B:&nbsp; Stock</p>
<p>At expiration, the cash will grow to be worth E, the
exercise price.&nbsp; Portfolio A will use this cash to
secure the exercise price.&nbsp; If the stock is <u>above</u>
the strike price and Portfolio A exercises the call, the
investor will receive the value of the stock price minus
the exercise price (S - E) plus E from the cash which
can be written: S - E + E = S.&nbsp; So, if Portfolio A
exercises <u>at expiration</u>, Portfolio A is worth the
stock price -- exactly as Portfolio B, which contains
only the stock. </p>
<p>However, if the stock price falls <u>below</u> the
exercise price, E, at expiration, then Portfolio A will
lose the value of the call and only be worth E, the
cash.&nbsp; Portfolio B will be worth less than Portfolio A
because the stock price is below the exercise price.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, Portfolio A is always worth <u>at least</u> as
much as Portfolio B.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But if Portfolio A exercises <i>early</i>, the
portfolio is worth S minus E (from the exercise) minus
the present value of E, which must be less than S.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because you are subtracting off E and then adding
back a number a little smaller than E (because it's the
present value).&nbsp; Now, this is the only time Portfolio B
can dominate Portfolio A, so A should not exercise
early.</p>
<p>I told you I don't like these proofs and now you
probably see why!</p>
<p>If you read our section on synthetics during week 11,
you will recognize that Portfolio A is really a
synthetic call option.&nbsp; By exercising early, Portfolio A
gives up the protective value of the put.&nbsp; So no matter
which method you use<i>, it is never optimal to exercise
a call option on a non-dividend paying stock early.</i></p>
<h2>Capturing a dividend</h2>
<p>We have been saying to never exercise a call option
early <u>except to capture a dividend</u>.&nbsp; Why would an
investor want to do that?&nbsp; There are a couple of
reasons.&nbsp; One, the stock may have announced a huge,
special dividend.&nbsp; As a call option owner, you are not
entitled to anything other than the price appreciation
in the stock above the strike price.&nbsp; If the dividend is
large enough, you may find it beneficial to exercise the
call early in order to be the owner of the actual stock
and therefore be entitled to the dividend.&nbsp; In this
case, the investor should wait as long as possible and
exercise the call the day before ex-dividend date.</p>
<p>The second reason that investors will exercise the
call option early is to reduce a loss due to a
dividend.&nbsp; Say a stock is trading at $100 and will pay a
$1 dollar dividend tomorrow.&nbsp; A trader bought a $95 call
a while back for $10, and it is now trading for $5 plus
a little time premium.&nbsp; The option will expire in a
relatively short time. </p>
<p>However, the stock will be trading for $99 tomorrow
morning ex-dividend (the price of the stock is reduced
to reflect the dividend payment from the company).&nbsp; What
will happen to the call? &nbsp;It will trade for $4 because
the stock is down $1, so the trader may elect to
exercise the call early to reduce the loss.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So exercising early to capture a known dividend is
really a loss reduction strategy as opposed to a
profit-seeking one. </p>
<h2>One exception for margin traders</h2>
<p>Here is a great tip you will not see in any books or
hear from brokers.&nbsp; Say you trade on margin (borrowed
funds) and are holding a very deep-in-the-money call,
maybe a $30 call with the stock trading for $100.&nbsp;
Assume there is some time left on the option; it could
be a few days or even months.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you exercise early, you will meet the Fed call for
the stock just by exercising!&nbsp; This is because the call
is so deep-in-the-money.&nbsp; Because you are receiving
stock so highly valued relative to the strike, your
margin cash available and buying power will explode to
the upside.&nbsp; So if you are in a situation where you need
to generate cash available or buying power to take
advantage of a certain stock, or perhaps to meet a
margin call, exercising early may be your answer!</p>
<p>The reason you never see this in the textbooks is
because, by itself, exercising early gains you nothing
in the asset.&nbsp; It is only due to other market mechanics
of margin trading where it may benefit you.&nbsp; So, keep
that in the back of your mind if you ever are lucky
enough to have a call option go very deep-in-the-money
and need to trade on margin.&nbsp; You should definitely
check with your broker for specific details.</p>
<h2>Early exercise with puts</h2>
<p>Early exercise with puts, unlike calls, may be
advantageous to the long position.&nbsp; This is because put
options represent a cash inflow to your account.&nbsp; If the
put option is very deep-in-the-money (technically where
delta is equal to one), the put should be exercised.&nbsp; As
an example, assume you are holding a $100 put option
with 3 months of time remaining.&nbsp; The stock is trading
at $40 and you see no hopes of it coming back above $100
by expiration.&nbsp; If you wait until expiration, you will
receive $100 for your stock.&nbsp; If you exercise now, you
will receive $100 for your stock.&nbsp; Which do you prefer?&nbsp;
As with any cash inflow, we prefer to have it paid
earlier as opposed to later, so we exercise the put and
take our $100 now.</p>
<p>Although options can be used as a tool to buy or sell
stock, most option contracts, somewhere in the
neighborhood of 98%, never become exercised.&nbsp; This is
because most option traders use them as a hedge.&nbsp; For
example if an option trader has 100 shares of stock at
$50 and also has a $50 put.&nbsp; The stock closes at $40.&nbsp;
Rather than using the put to sell the stock, the option
trader will close out the put for a $10 gain and use
that to offset the $10 loss in the long position.&nbsp;
Because of this fact, most option traders are not very
familiar with exercising options.&nbsp; Make sure you become
very aware with when and why to exercise.&nbsp;Not
understanding can be costly.</p>
