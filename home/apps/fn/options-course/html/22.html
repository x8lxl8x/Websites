<h1>Options Expiration Cycles</h1>

<p>You may have noticed that not all stocks have the
same months available for options.&nbsp; For example, it is
now October and MRVC has April options, but SCMR does
not.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; When will April options become
available for SCMR? &nbsp;In order to answer these questions,
you need to understand option expiration cycles.</p>
<p>When options first started trading in 1973, the <i>
Chicago Board Options Exchange </i>(CBOE) decided that
there would only be four months of equity options traded
at any given time.&nbsp; Later, with the advent of LEAPS
(Long Term Equity Anticipation Securities) more than
four months could be traded, at least for the more
popular securities.&nbsp; Your local newspaper probably only
prints three of these months, to conserve space, but
understand that there are always <u>at least four</u>
different months traded at any given time (more if LEAPS
are available).</p>
<p>Originally, stocks were assigned to one of three
cycles, either a January, February, or March cycle.&nbsp; The
assignment had nothing to do with earnings cycles of a
company or any other deep-seated reason; it was purely a
random assignment.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Option cycles</h2>
<p>A January cycle meant that options would be traded on
the first month of each quarter.&nbsp; So if a stock were
assigned a January cycle under the original rules,
options could <u>only</u> be traded in the following
months:</p>
<p><b>Jan</b> Feb Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Oct</b> Nov
Dec</p>
<p>A February cycle could only trade on the middle
months of each quarter:</p>
<p>Jan <b>Feb</b> Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apr <b>May</b>
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jul <b>Aug</b> Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct <b>Nov</b>
Dec</p>
<p>And of course, the March cycle would be traded on the
end-months: March, June, September, and December.</p>
<p>Because of these positions, sometimes you will hear
the cycles referred to as front-month (January),
mid-month (February) or end-month (March) cycles.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As options gained in popularity, investors and
floor-traders alike were looking for ways to trade or
hedge for shorter terms.&nbsp; So around 1984, the CBOE
decided to always trade the <i>current month</i>, the <i>
following month</i> (called the near-term contract), and
an additional two months from the original cycle.&nbsp; This
can get a little confusing, so it is best to explain
with an example.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Say it is now January and we are looking at a stock
that trades options on a January cycle.&nbsp; Which months
will be traded?</p>
<p><b>Jan Feb</b> Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct Nov Dec</p>
<p>Looking at the above diagram may help.&nbsp; Remember,
under the new rules, the CBOE decided that there would
always be the current month plus the following month
available.&nbsp; Because it is January in our example, then
January and February will be available.&nbsp; Because four
months must trade, the remaining two months will be from
the <u>original cycle</u>, which would be April and
July.</p>
<h2>What happens when January expires?</h2>
<p>When January expires, then the current contract will
be February so we would see the following:</p>
<p>Jan <b>Feb Mar</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct Nov Dec</p>
<p>When February expires, March will be the current
contract so we will see:</p>
<p>Jan Feb <b>Mar </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct Nov Dec</p>
<p>However, notice now that only three contracts are
traded and we need four!</p>
<p>Because a fourth contract must now be made available,
October will be added because it is the next month
available on the January cycle so, when February
expires, we will see:</p>
<p>Jan Feb <b>Mar </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Oct</b> Nov
Dec&nbsp; </p>
<p>A commonly asked question is, continuing with the
above example, &quot;When will, say, November contracts be
traded&quot;?</p>
<p>This is easy once you understand option cycles.&nbsp; The
first thing you want to ask is this:&nbsp; Is November part
of the January cycle?&nbsp; No, it is part of the February
cycle.&nbsp; Because it is not on the same cycle, the <u>only</u>
time it will become available will be when the September
contract expires.&nbsp; When September expires, October will
be the current contract and November will start trading.</p>
<p>Ok, here's where it gets a little tricky.&nbsp; See if you
can answer the following question using the diagram
below, still assuming a January cycle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jan Feb Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> <b>May</b>
Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Jul</b> Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Oct</b>
Nov Dec</p>
<p>It is now April and we have April, May, July, and
October trading as shown above.&nbsp; When will the January
contracts start trading?</p>
<p>Because we're wondering about a month that <u>does</u>
in fact fall on the January cycle, this one may open for
trading months in advance.</p>
<p>If you run through the steps above, you will see that
the January contract will start trading when May
expires.&nbsp; Once May is expired, June will become the
current month, so there will be a June, July and October
for a total of three months.&nbsp; The fourth month will be
the addition of January.</p>
<h2>LEAPS</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are always at least four
contracts trading at all times.&nbsp; If a stock has LEAPS
traded, then more than four months will be available.&nbsp;
Once you understand the basic option cycle, adding LEAPS
is not too difficult.</p>
<p>LEAPS are long-term options that usually trade in
January for a maximum of three years out, although there
are exceptions.&nbsp; If a stock trades LEAPS, then new LEAPS
will be issued in May, June, or July, depending on the
cycle.&nbsp; When January month is &quot;hit&quot; in the normal
rotation (other than by default as the current or
near-term contract), a new LEAP will be added.&nbsp; The
January option will become a normal option and the root
symbol will change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Again, this is difficult to explain without the use
of examples so let's look at INTC options.</p>
<p>It is currently November and INTC has the following
months trading: </p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Month</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Root Symbol</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>November</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>INQ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>December</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>INQ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>April</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>INQ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>January '01</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>INQ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>January '02</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>WNL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>January '03</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>VNL</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>From what we learned earlier, we know there must be a
November and December contract and we see that there
is.&nbsp; You can never tell which cycle a particular stock
is on just by looking at the first two months; remember,
all options will have these months being traded.</p>
<p>We see that January '01 is the next contract traded.&nbsp;
Normally, this would tell us that this stock is on a
January cycle.&nbsp; However, INTC has LEAPS, too which means
there will always be a January option traded so we still
cannot be sure which cycle it is on just because we see
January next in line.&nbsp; Looking out to the next month, we
see April is trading.&nbsp; Because April is part of the
January cycle, we can now be certain that INTC trades on
a January cycle.</p>
<p><b>Jan</b> Feb Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Apr</b> May Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jul Aug Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct <b>Nov Dec</b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Based on what we know, the four months highlighted
above should be trading for INTC, and we see they are
when compared to the above table.&nbsp; When November
expires, December and January become the current and
near-term months respectively, and July will be added.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In this case, <u>no</u> LEAPS will be added because
the LEAPS are currently out three years to '03.</p>
<p>However, when May expiration comes around, June,
July, October will be trading and January will be
added.&nbsp; At this point, the '02 LEAPS will have their
root symbol changed to INQ and the '04 LEAPS will be
added.</p>
<p>So depending on which cycle your stock is on, look
for new LEAPS to be added sometime in late May, June, or
July.&nbsp; Otherwise, the basic option expiration cycle
applies.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the questions asked at the very
beginning and see if we can find out the answers:</p>
<p>It is now October and MRVC has April options but SCMR
does not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) Why is that?&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) When will April options become available for
SCMR?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Looking at the options for MRVC there are:</p>
<p>November, December, January, April</p>
<p>For SCMR:</p>
<p>November, December, March, June</p>
<p>It is evident there are no LEAPS as there are only
four contract months trading.&nbsp; We know there will be
November and December for each.&nbsp; For MRVC, the next
month is January so it is on a January cycle and SCMR is
on a March cycle.</p>
<p>When will April options become available for SCMR?</p>
<p>Because April is not part of the March cycle, the
only time April options will become available will be
when February expires.&nbsp; At that time, March will be the
current month and April will be the near-term contract.</p>
<p>Option expiration cycles can be a little confusing if
you are new to them.&nbsp; With a little work, they will
become second nature.&nbsp; They are important to know
because many strategies require some type of position
management during the holding period, yet the proper
contracts may not exist.&nbsp; Understanding these cycles can
give you an added edge in option trading!</p>
<h2>Additional questions:</h2>
<p><b>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now August and your stock trades on
a March cycle.&nbsp; Which months should you expect to see
trading?</b></p>
<p>Jan Feb <b>Mar</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apr May Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jul
<b>Aug Sep</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct Nov <b>Dec</b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We will see the current and near-term months trading,
which will be August and September.&nbsp; In addition, we
will see two contracts from the original March cycle,
which will be December and March.</p>
<p><b>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will the May contracts start trading?</b></p>
<p>Because May is not part of the March cycle, the only
time they could trade is when March contracts expire.&nbsp;
At that time, April will be the current month and May
will be the near-term.</p>
<p><b>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will the June contracts begin
trading?</b></p>
<p>Since June is part of the March cycle, it could start
trading months in advance, so we need to be careful
here.&nbsp; Run through them step-by-step.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When August expires, we will have September, October,
December and March for a total of four contracts so no
June contracts, will trade at this point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When September expires, we will see October,
November, December and March, so June still will not
trade.</p>
<p>When October expires, we will have November, December
and March for a total of three.&nbsp; At this time, June
contracts will be rolled out. </p>
