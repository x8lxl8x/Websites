<h1>Butterfly</h1>

<p>As you become more involved in trading options, you
will no doubt hear about a strategy known as the
&quot;butterfly spread.&quot;</p>
<p>The butterfly spread is one of many strategies that
belong to a family collectively known as &quot;wing spreads&quot;;
they get this name, as you will soon see, from the shape
of their profit and loss diagrams.</p>
<p>The butterfly spread is avidly written about in many
options books, so it tends to attract traders who want
to venture into new strategies.&nbsp; But because the
strategy involves three or four separate commissions
(and sometimes more depending on how the spread is
constructed) to open and the same number to close, it is
very costly and typically not a good strategy for the
retail investor.</p>
<p>The butterfly spread is really designed for
floor-traders to take advantage of pricing discrepancies
between spreads.&nbsp; While it is not an arbitrage play, it
stacks the odds in their favor, largely due to the fact
they are not paying retail commissions.</p>
<h2>The long butterfly spread</h2>
<p>A basic butterfly spread involves three strike
prices, which we shall generically call low, medium, and
high.&nbsp; For the long butterfly, the trader will buy 1 low
strike, sell 2 medium strikes, and buy 1 high strike all
with the same expiration dates.&nbsp; The butterfly can be
executed with either calls or puts (or a combination).&nbsp;
The high and low strikes must be the same distance from
the medium option.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>A stock is trading at $100, and a trader wants to
place a butterfly spread.&nbsp; The trader may buy 1 $95
call, sell 2 $100, calls and buy 1 $105 call.&nbsp; Notice
how the high and low strikes are the same distance, in
this example $5, from the medium strike.&nbsp; This would be
called a $95/$100/$105 butterfly.&nbsp; Sometimes traders
will just refer to the &quot;body&quot; of the butterfly and call
it simply a $100 butterfly.</p>
<p>The long butterfly spread is always executed in a
1-2-1 pattern -- buy 1, sell 2, buy 1.&nbsp; Of course, you
could elect to do multiple spreads in which case your
pattern would be 2-4-2 or 3-6-3 or any other combination
as long as the middle strike is always double the number
of contracts as either the high or low.</p>
<p>If you execute a 2-4-2 pattern, this is considered 2
butterfly spreads; a 3-6-3 is considered to be 3
spreads.</p>
<h2>Understanding the butterfly</h2>
<p>There are many ways to view a butterfly spread.&nbsp; In
fact, there are probably an infinite number of ways to
construct one although most investors who are faintly
familiar with them will tell you there are only two ways
(either with calls or puts) and always three strikes.&nbsp; A
trader can use calls, puts, combinations of the two, and
synthetic versions of each piece of the butterfly to
create the same profit and loss diagrams.&nbsp; All ways are
equally correct as long as the profit and loss diagrams
look the same.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to view the long butterfly is
as a combination of a long bull spread and a long bear
spread.&nbsp; For example, the trader in the above example
went long 1 $95 call, short 2 $100 calls, and long 1
$105 call.&nbsp; We can look at that trade in another way as
follows:</p>
<p>Long&nbsp; $95 call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This is the bull spread</b><br>
Short $100 call</p>
<p>Short $100 call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This is the bear spread</b><br>
Long&nbsp; $105 call</p>
<p>We see the long bull and long bear spreads consist of
exactly the same pieces as the butterfly spread:&nbsp; long 1
$95, short 2 $100, long 1 $105.</p>
<p>If you understand the butterfly spread in this way,
it will help to understand why it is so useful to the
floor traders.</p>
<h2>Why floor traders love butterflies</h2>
<p>Let's assume a stock is trading for $101 and we see
the following quotes on some call options:</p>
<table cellSpacing='0' cellPadding='0' border='1' id='table4'>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Option</b></td>
<td v>
<p align='center'><b>Quote</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$95 call</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$100 call</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$105 call</td>
<td v>
<p align='center'>$6</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We know from basic option pricing that the $95 call
should be more than the $100 and the $100 more than the
$105, and we see that they are.&nbsp; In addition, the
differences in price do not exceed the strikes, so no
problems there (if you are unsure about these
principles, please see our section under &quot;Basic Option
Pricing&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, after checking these basic relationships,
market makers will additionally check spreads and
straddles for other possible mispricings.</p>
<p>Here is what they will look for:&nbsp; the $95/$100 bull
spread becomes more valuable as the stock rises.&nbsp; In
fact, the maximum profit is achieved if the stock price
is above $100 at expiration.&nbsp; With the stock at $101,
the bull spread, at this point, <u>would be at maximum
profit</u> if the options were to expire
instantaneously.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the bear spread.&nbsp; The bear spread
consists of the short $100 call and the long $105 call.&nbsp;
This spread will become more valuable as the stock
falls; in fact, the maximum profit here will occur if
the stock is below $100 at expiration.&nbsp; The bear spread,
unlike the bull spread at this point, will be <u>below
maximum profit</u> if the options expire
instantaneously.</p>
<p>So if you <u>had</u> to pick a spread to be the
winner, which would it be?&nbsp; Obviously, it should be the
bull spread because it is theoretically worth more.&nbsp; But
look at the quotes again -- we see both spreads are
prices at $2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>How?&nbsp; The bull spread consists of the long $95 and
short $100 for a net debit of $2.&nbsp; The bear spread
consists of the short $100 and long $105 for a net
credit of $2.</p>
<p>With the stock at $101, the market maker knows the
bull spread should be more valuable relative to the bear
spread, so he'll buy the bull spread and sell the bear
spread -- a butterfly spread.</p>
<p>Notice that this does not guarantee a profit -- the
stock could fall below $95 or rise above $105 -- so is
not an arbitrage play.&nbsp; It does, however, allow the
market maker to take an unfair advantage of a mispricing
and put the odds on his side that the trade will, in
fact, be profitable. This is one of many trading
situations known as a pseudo-arbitrage because it does
not guarantee a profit, but is traded solely from a
theoretical mispricing viewpoint; it is an arbitrage on
theoretical odds. </p>
<h2>What does a butterfly spread look like?</h2>
<p>The profit and loss diagram for the above butterfly
looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/070.gif'>

<p>Notice how there is no loss area; the lowest this
spread can go, in this example, is zero.&nbsp; This is
because it was constructed with the bull and bear spread
priced the same, so there was no cash outlay -- the
market maker paid $2 for the bull spread and received $2
for the bear spread.&nbsp; Realistically, there may be a
slight debit, especially after commissions, so it may
actually look like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/071.gif'>

<p>The point is that with a butterfly (assuming a very
low debit or low commissions), you have very little loss
area but a high profit area albeit over a small range of
stock prices.&nbsp; In a lot of ways, it's like playing the
lottery.&nbsp; The market makers are thinking they have
little to lose but much to gain.&nbsp; The maximum profit
will be achieved at the strike price of the short, in
this case, $100.</p>
<p>If you use your imagination, the profit and loss
diagram looks like the wings of a butterfly (I told you
to use your imagination!) -- hence the name butterfly
spread.</p>
<h2>Iron butterfly</h2>
<p>Another way to view the spread is that it's the
combination of a short straddle and long strangle
(please see our section on &quot;Straddles and Strangles&quot; for
more information on these strategies).&nbsp; If a trader
executes a short straddle and long strangle, it is a
special variation of the butterfly known as an <i>iron
butterfly</i>.&nbsp; The trader of an iron butterfly wants
the stock to fall, so the above profit and loss diagram
is actually a <i>short iron butterfly</i> or <i>long
butterfly</i>.&nbsp; The short straddle is easy to see; it is
the part that forms the upside down &quot;V&quot; in the diagram.&nbsp;
The long strangle just provides protection from further
losses if the stock falls below $95 or rises above
$105.&nbsp; It is the long strangle that forms the protective
&quot;wings&quot; to the left and right of the diagram.&nbsp; If a
butterfly spread is constructed in this manner, there
will be four commissions to open and four to close.</p>
<p>If you can ever execute a butterfly for a very low
debit, you may want to consider it.&nbsp; If you can ever
execute it for a credit, do not pass it up, as this
would be an arbitrage situation -- you cannot lose!</p>
<p>Let's look at some real numbers and see why retail
investors should think twice before entering a butterfly
spread.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>MSFT is currently trading for $68-3/4 with the
following option quotes available:</p>
<p>Dec $65 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;$6-1/2 ask<br>
Dec $70 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;$3-3/8 bid<br>
Dec $75 call =&nbsp;&nbsp;$1-3/4 ask</p>
<p>Let's trade the $65/$70/$75 butterfly and see what
happens:</p>
<p>Long 1 $65 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$6-1/2<br>
Short 2 $70 =&nbsp;&nbsp;+$6-3/4<br>
Long 1 $75 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>-$1-3/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1-1/2</p>
<p>Now, to make it more realistic, let's say you pay a
commission of $100 for the three contracts, which may be
a conservative number.&nbsp; Now you must add $100 to the
cost.&nbsp; Remember that we are dealing with three different
strikes, so there will be three separate commissions --
and that's just to buy it.</p>
<p>Now our net debit is $2-1/2 and the maximum we can
make is $5.&nbsp; Here's our profit and loss diagram so far:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/072.gif'>

<p>It already looks much different from the market
maker's above.&nbsp; Notice just how much more &quot;loss&quot; area
there is in this diagram.</p>
<p>Now, our break-even points are $67-1/2 and $72-1/2.&nbsp;
If the stock closes below $67-1/2 or above $72-1/2, the
trade will incur losses, and we haven't even considered
the commissions to get out.</p>
<p>Already it's a pretty narrow range in order to be
profitable -- a five-point range between break-even
points.&nbsp; Let's assume the stock closes at exactly $70,
which is the point of maximum gain.&nbsp; We make $250 but
have to pay another $100 in commissions for a total of
$150.</p>
<p>Now, it still may not seem like such a bad deal,
after all, $150 bucks is $150 bucks.&nbsp; But this was
assuming the stock closed at exactly $70.&nbsp; Just how much
room do we have to work?</p>
<p>Taking the sell commissions into account, here's how
the trade looks now:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/073.gif'>

<p>The stock must close above $68-1/2 or below $71-1/2
in order to get <u>anything</u>.&nbsp; In order to get the
full $150, we need the stock at <u>exactly</u> $70.&nbsp; If
you can call the stock closing prices within this close
of a range, you're probably better off selling naked
calls, puts, or straddles.</p>
<p>The butterfly spread is an interesting combination
strategy, which you will no doubt hear about as you
continue with your options trading.&nbsp; Over the past seven
years, I have seen many retail investors attempt
butterfly spreads and did not see one -- not a single
one -- make a dime.</p>
<p>If you decide to try one, you may want to check with
your broker regarding commissions and break-even
points.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My guess is that you will decide against it.</p>
