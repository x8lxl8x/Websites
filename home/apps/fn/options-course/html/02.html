<h1>Best Strategy</h1>

<p>You've probably heard many opinions as to which
option strategies are the best:&nbsp; Covered calls are best
because they reduce the risk but still allow for a
profit.&nbsp; Naked puts are the best because you're getting
paid to buy stock.&nbsp; Straddles are the best because they
allow you to make money whether the market is going up
or down.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you've been trading options for a while, you no
doubt have heard many others.&nbsp; But, when you hear
comments such as these, all you're hearing are opinions
of one trader's preference for a particular risk-reward
profile.&nbsp; In order to really understand option trading,
you need to understand that all option strategies come
with their own sets of risks and rewards and the market
will price them accordingly.&nbsp; Be careful of anyone
telling you that a particular strategy is superior to
another; they either do not fully understand options or
are trying to sell you something.</p>
<p>Traders who tout superior option strategies focus on
one aspect of the strategy -- either the risk or reward
side -- and completely neglect the counterpart.&nbsp; They
will make comments such as, &quot;Calls are superior to stock
because the return on investment is much higher.&quot;&nbsp; It's
easy to make them consider the risk side by replying,
&quot;Sure, but lottery tickets are superior to calls because
the return on investment is even higher!&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The best option strategy is the one that directly
matches <i>your </i>set of risk and reward tolerances
for a given outlook on the underlying.&nbsp; This is the
level of option trading you want to achieve.&nbsp; Learn to
dissect a position into its component parts and see if
you are willing to accept the associated risks.&nbsp; Learn
the various strategies and how to further tailor them to
match your needs better.&nbsp; Don't spend your time looking
for the superior option strategy.&nbsp; It doesn't exist.</p>
<h2>Understanding risk and reward</h2>
<p>To fully understand the relationships between risk
and reward with options, we need to look at profit and
loss diagrams. (Please see our section next week on
&quot;profit and loss diagrams&quot; if you are not familiar with
them.&nbsp; We will show you in detail how to construct and
read them next week.)</p>
<p>If you compare the profit and loss diagrams of <u>any</u>
two strategies, there will <u>always</u> be a part of
the diagram where each strategy dominates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, let's revisit the earlier comment.&nbsp; Are
call options superior to stock?&nbsp; Assume one investor
buys stock for $50 and another buys the $50 call for $5.</p>
<p>We can plot the profit and loss at expiration for
each position, and we will get the following diagram:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/001.gif'>

<p>For example, the trader who buys stock at $50 will
make $5 profit if the stock is trading for $55.&nbsp; If you
look at the above chart, you can see that the profit and
loss line (red) crosses the $5 profit line for a stock
price of $55.&nbsp; Likewise, if the stock is trading for
$45, the trader will incur a $5 loss.</p>
<p>The diagram also shows that the long $50 call buyer
(blue) will lose $5 if the stock is $50 or below and
will break even if the stock is $55.&nbsp; At a stock price
of $60, the $50 call buyer will make $5 profit (the call
option will be worth $10 but the trader paid $5)</p>
<p>Notice the profit and loss diagram for stock (red).&nbsp;
It is superior to (lies above) the profit and loss line
for the long call (blue) for all stock prices above
$45.&nbsp; This is because the call option buyer is
effectively paying $55 for the stock ($50 strike for a
cost of $5).&nbsp; If the stock stays above $45, the long
stock position is the better strategy (the red line is
above the blue line).&nbsp; But if the stock falls below $45,
the call option becomes the better strategy (the blue
line is above the red line), as the most the long call
will lose is the premium.&nbsp; It should be evident that one
strategy is not better than the other; it depends on
your outlook of the stock and the amount of risk you are
willing to accept.</p>
<p>An investor who believes the stock will stay above
$50 is better off buying stock.&nbsp; Of course, there is a
tradeoff of accepting a potential $50 maximum loss.&nbsp;
Conversely, an investor who believes the stock is
heading higher but doesn't want the exposure to the
downside is better off buying the call.&nbsp; The tradeoff is
that he will pay $55 for the stock instead of $50, but
in return, only be subjected to a $5 maximum loss.</p>
<p>If traders are more concerned with the downside risk,
they will bid up the price of the call.&nbsp; If they feel
the price of the call is too high relative to the stock,
they will sell the call (either naked or covered).&nbsp;
These actions will price the call fairly with respect to
investors' opinions, and neither strategy will be
superior to the other.</p>
<p>What about naked puts?&nbsp; They must be better than
stock because you are actually getting paid to buy the
stock, right?</p>
<p>Let's look at the profit and loss diagram between
stock purchased for $50 and a naked $50 put sold for $5:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/002.gif'>

<p>Again, in some areas of the chart the long stock
position dominates, and in others it does not.&nbsp; The long
stock position is better for stock prices above $55.&nbsp;
With the stock above $55, the long stock investor will
realize unlimited profits, while the naked put will
profit only by the premium received from the sale of the
put.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, if the stock is below $55, the naked put is
the better strategy.&nbsp; Below a $50 stock price, both
investors lose but the naked put seller is ahead by the
premium.</p>
<p>Maybe a long call is better than a naked put?&nbsp; Some
may reason that the long call position makes more money
than the short put if the stock rises and loses less if
it falls, so it is a better strategy.&nbsp; Let's assume a
long $50 call and short $50 put are each traded for $5:
</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/003.gif'>

<p>Looking at the above chart we see that the long call
position (red) does dominate for all stock prices above
$60 and below $40. &nbsp;But if the stock stays between these
prices, the naked put is clearly the better choice.&nbsp;
Your outlook on the stock and tolerance for risk will
determine which strategy is best for you.</p>
<p>Pick any two strategies and look at their profit and
loss diagrams.&nbsp; You will always see that each strategy
will dominate over a given range of stock prices.&nbsp; Try
switching one position from long to short.&nbsp; Try changing
strike prices.&nbsp; You will soon see that it does not
matter; one strategy cannot dominate another for <i>all</i>
stock prices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Strategies come in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Now you
should have a better understanding why.&nbsp; Different
strategies alter the risk-reward relationships and it is
up to you, the trader, to decide which is best.&nbsp; Do not
be afraid to alter the strategy to meet your taste --
that is what option trading is all about.&nbsp; If you accept
somebody's strategy as the &quot;best,&quot; you are, by default,
accepting his or her risk tolerances too.&nbsp; If those
tolerances are not in line with yours, you will
eventually learn, the expensive way, that no strategy is
superior to another.</p>
