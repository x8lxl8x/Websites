<h1>Options For The Market</h1>

<p>Many times I am asked if options are good for the
market.&nbsp; After all, there is no new equity created as
when new shares of stock are issued.&nbsp; What seems to be
happening is that we are allowing a legalized gambling
arena.&nbsp; At least, this is what the popular financial
press would have us believe.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Further, we saw Baring's Bank, a 233-year old
institution that helped finance the Napoleonic Wars,
brought down <em>single-handedly</em> by an options
trader.&nbsp; Certainly options cannot be good for anybody,
right?</p>
<p>Before you take that view, let me show you why
options were created and why they are actually good for
the market.&nbsp; Options were created out of economic
necessity, and are a logical extension of a
well-developed financial market.</p>
<p>To help you understand, assume that there are no
options and only stocks.&nbsp; Say you want to buy shares of
ABC stock, trading for $100, and you're a long-term
investor -- none of this short-term speculative stuff
for you!&nbsp; When you decide to purchase shares for your
long-term hold, what's better for you, one seller or
two?&nbsp; Obviously, two sellers are better, as they will
compete for your business and help to <em>lower your
purchase price</em>.&nbsp; Likewise, when you sell your
stock, would you prefer one buyer or two?&nbsp; Again, you
should prefer two, as they will compete for your
business and help to <em>raise your selling price</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In other words, the more market participants you
have, the better off you are whether buying or selling.&nbsp;
Another way to say this is that the bid-ask spreads will
be narrowed, causing more stock to transact -- and more
wealth to be created.&nbsp; The spreads will narrow because
the buyers will compete by raising the bid price (giving
incentive for sellers to enter the market), and the
sellers will compete by lowering the asking price
(giving incentive for buyers to enter the market).&nbsp; The
financial markets always benefit from narrow spreads.</p>
<p>Notice in the following diagram how the bid-ask
spreads (red-dotted line) cause less shares to be sold
(122,000 instead of 128,000) when compared to no spread
(solid blue line).</p>

<p>Now, back to the buying of your stock.&nbsp; At this time
there is only one seller, who also is a long-term player
and has held this stock for ten years.&nbsp; Notice the nice,
neat, clean market we have here with no speculators.&nbsp;
However, with only one seller, this is certainly not a
good situation for you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now let's meet Sam Speculator.&nbsp; Sam likes to
speculate on market direction.&nbsp; He's willing to take big
risks and gamble for big profits.&nbsp; Long-term investing
for him is measured in hours.&nbsp; He just happens to think
ABC stock will fall a few points.&nbsp; He would short the
shares (which would be good for you since you'd have
another seller), but he's very afraid to because of the
recent volatility in ABC.&nbsp; He doesn't want to take the
risk of the stock moving higher.&nbsp; So he sits on the
sideline, leaving you with just the one seller.</p>
<p>Now let's enter the options market.&nbsp; Call options
give market participants a way to purchase stock, while
put options provide a way to sell stock for a fraction
of the cost of the stock.&nbsp; In addition, the owner of a
call or put option has risk that is limited to the
amount paid for the option.&nbsp; This idea gets Sam's
attention.&nbsp; He puts in a bid to buy 10 of the $100
strike puts for a price of $5 1/2.</p>
<p>The market maker sees this order and wants to fill
it, as this is how he makes money.&nbsp; He will create a <i>
synthetic put</i> by selling stock and buying a call.&nbsp;
In other words, the market maker must &quot;manufacture&quot; the
long put option that Sam wants.&nbsp; But where will the
market maker be able to buy the call?&nbsp; He doesn't know
either, so he puts in a bid to buy one for, say, $5-1/4.</p>
<p>Another investor, Conservative Connie, also hates the
idea of speculation in the markets.&nbsp; However, she will
gladly sell someone a call option against stock in her
IRA account, as it will give her income without the need
for selling her shares.&nbsp; She happens to own ABC stock,
so she sells the market maker the call and pockets the
$5-1/4 per share.&nbsp; She's willing to assume the downside
risk on ABC (if she wasn't, she wouldn't own it).&nbsp;
Connie doesn't think the stock will fall; Sam thinks it
will.&nbsp; Together, they bring more stock to the market.</p>
<p>Notice what's happened.&nbsp; The market maker shorts
stock, which is really what Sam wanted to do but was
afraid of the risk.&nbsp; The market maker then protected
himself with the purchase of a call and sold that
package (a synthetic put) as a long put to Sam.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You wanted to buy shares of ABC but now have <u>two
sellers instead of one</u>.&nbsp; The market maker, in
essence, has partitioned his risk between two other
players.&nbsp; Together, Sam and Connie hold the synthetic
short position (Sam is long the put and Connie is short
the call).&nbsp; Because those two participants were willing
to accept the associated risks, the market maker was
able to short the stock, thus lowering the asking price
of the stock you're interested in buying!</p>
<p>Options, in this example, gave us an arena in which
to meet speculators.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where they live
or what they want to use the option for.&nbsp; In this
example, Connie was willing to assume the downside risk
of the stock if she could get paid for it.&nbsp; Sam was
willing to pay for that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sam doesn't
know Connie.&nbsp; But, through the options market, Sam and
Connie are matched.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the options markets bring in more
participants, making the spreads narrower for all.&nbsp; So
speculators are actually a necessary part of financial
markets, and although it's sometimes difficult to see,
they make the markets better and more efficient.</p>
<p>If you're still not convinced, think about the bond
market.&nbsp; Bonds are almost always associated with
conservative investing.&nbsp; If you buy a bond, you may see
yourself as a responsible, conservative investor.&nbsp; In
fact, you may even hate the idea of borrowing!&nbsp; No
credit cards or debts of any kind for you.&nbsp; Now for the
hidden truth.&nbsp; Who do you think is on the other side of
that bond trade?&nbsp; A borrower -- <em>a speculator</em> --
hoping to make a profit by earning more with the
borrowed funds than they will owe in interest.&nbsp; If you
love the idea of loaning money, be glad there are
speculators in the world.&nbsp; No speculators, no bond
market.</p>
<p>Speculators are an essential part of any
well-functioning market.&nbsp; While it is a tragedy that
Nick Leeson single-handedly brought down Barings Bank
with options, that is the fault of the <em>user</em> and
not of the options market.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Keep in mind there were also investors on the <em>
other</em> side of those trades, and for every option
trade there is a winner for every loser, as shown in the
following chart:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/020.gif'>

<p>Notice how the profit and loss diagrams are mirror
images for the long and short positions.&nbsp; Money merely
changes hands from one person to the other.&nbsp; In this
way, options can be viewed as a &quot;bet&quot; between two
people, but that should not trick you into believing
that's why they were created.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the world, a conservative mutual fund
manager may have desired puts as a hedge for his mutual
fund, and bought the puts that Nick was selling.&nbsp;
Options are about transferring risk.&nbsp; Nick Leeson was
selling straddles on a Japanese index <em>speculating</em>
on a quiet market; he was accepting the risk the mutual
fund manager wanted to hedge.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because of this, that mutual fund may have had a
great year and provided for a new home for someone or
protected their IRA account.&nbsp; The fund may have sent
someone to college who, otherwise, never would have had
a chance.&nbsp; But we will never know the name of this
person as we know Nick Leeson's.&nbsp; We will never know,
because that is not horrific news, so it just vanishes
into the background.&nbsp; It's easy to overlook what you
cannot see.&nbsp; But they are there every time another loses
on an option trade.</p>
<p>Options are good for the market.&nbsp; They create
narrower spreads and provide excellent hedges for
conservative investors.&nbsp; They are also excellent
speculating tools for those who use them responsibly.</p>
