<h1>Christmas Tree</h1>

<p>A Christmas tree strategy is similar to a ratio
spread.&nbsp; For calls, it involves the buying of one strike
and the sale of two higher strikes (for example, buy $50
call, sell a $55 call, sell a $60 call); for puts, a
trader will purchase one strike and sell two lower
strikes (for example, buy $50 put, sell a $45 put, sell
a $40 put).&nbsp; If you read our section on condor spreads,
you may recognize the strategy as a long condor spread
without the upper protective wing (for calls) or the
lower protective wing (for puts).</p>
<p>The idea behind this strategy is that the trader
lowers the cost basis of the long position by selling
two options against it, thereby accelerating the rate of
return on investment.&nbsp; However, unlike the ratio spread
where multiple calls of a single higher strike are sold
against the long position, the trader instead sells
multiple strikes.&nbsp; It is a lower risk, lower reward
strategy relative to the ratio spread.</p>
<h2>Example: </h2>
<p>A trader is bullish on a stock trading at $100 and
wants to go long a Christmas tree.&nbsp; He will buy the $100
call, sell the $105 call, and sell the $110 call for a
net credit of $1.&nbsp; The profit and loss diagram looks
like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/056.gif'>

<p>The trade is usually placed at a small credit and
reaches maximum profit at the strike of either short
position.&nbsp; If the stock moves above the highest short
call, $110 in this example, the trader will start to
lose profits and eventually end up with losses if the
stock rises far enough.</p>
<p>The trader is effectively taking a little more
conservative stance (although there is still the risk of
unlimited losses) relative to the ratio spreader.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>Corning (GLW) is currently trading for $59-3/4 with
the following option quotes.&nbsp; Let's compare a ratio
spread with a Christmas tree and see how they differ.&nbsp;
Investor A buys the $60 call and sells two $65 calls.&nbsp;

<p>This produces a credit of $3-3/4 as follows:</p>
<p>Buy $60 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$8 3/4<br>
Sell 2 $65 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$12 1/2</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3 3/4</p>
<p>Investor B enters a Christmas tree and buys the $60,
sells the $65 and sells the $70 for a net credit of
$2-1/4 as follows:</p>
<p>Buy $60 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- $8 3/4<br>
Sell $65 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$6 1/4<br>
Sell $70 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$4 3/4</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$2 1/4</p>
<p>Notice the higher reward, $3-3/4 credit versus
$2-1/4, with the ratio spread indicating the higher
risk.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/057.gif'>

<p>It is now easy to see the differences in the two
strategies.&nbsp; The ratio spread has a higher reward if the
stock should fall or hit $65, the point of maximum
profit for both strategies.&nbsp; If the stock collapses, the
ratio spread will keep the initial $3-3/4 credit while
the Christmas tree will keep $2-1/4.&nbsp; If the stock hits
$65, the ratio spread makes an additional $5, the
difference in strikes, for a total profit of $8-3/4.&nbsp;
Similarly, the Christmas tree will make $5 at a stock
price of $65 for a total of $7-1/4.</p>
<p>However, the ratio spread starts to lose profits for
any stock price above $65, while the Christmas tree does
not start to lose them until $70 -- one strike higher.</p>
<p>At a stock price of $66-1/2, the two strategies are
even; this is the point where the red line crosses the
blue line.&nbsp; Beyond $66-1/2, the Christmas tree strategy
dominates the ratio spread.&nbsp; This can be seen by the
fact that the blue line (Christmas tree) is above the
red line (ratio spread) for all stock prices above
$66-1/2.&nbsp; Likewise, the ratio spread wins for all stock
prices below $66- 1/2 and we can see that its profit and
loss line is above the Christmas tree's for all stock
prices below this level.</p>
<p>The ratio spread will start heading into losses after
the break-even $73-3/4, while the Christmas tree will
not start taking losses until the stock exceeds $77-1/4.</p>
<h2>Christmas tree using puts</h2>
<p>The Christmas tree with puts is used for the opposite
reasons as above.&nbsp; Here, the trader is bearish and wants
to buy puts but sell two additional lower strikes to
offset the cost.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Assume a trader is bearish on a stock trading at $100
and wants to go long a Christmas tree using puts.&nbsp; He
will buy the $100 put, sell the $95 put, and sell the
$90 put for a net credit of $1.&nbsp; The profit and loss
diagram looks like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/058.gif'>

<p>The trader will start to profit if the stock falls
below $100.&nbsp; At a stock price of $95, he will reach the
maximum profit of $6 ($5 difference in strikes + $1
credit) and remain at this maximum amount to a stock
price of $90.&nbsp; Below $90, the trader starts to lose
profits and will head into losses below the break-even
point of $84.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>Let's use the above option quotes again and compare a
ratio spread with a Christmas tree.&nbsp; Investor A again
will enter a ratio spread and buy the $60 put and sell
two $55 puts to finance the purchase.&nbsp; His net credit is
$3 as follows:</p>
<p>Buy $60 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$8 3/4<br>
Sell 2 $55 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$11 3/4</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3</p>
<p>Investor B enters a Christmas tree and buys the $60
put, and sells the $55 and $50 puts for a credit of $1
1/8:</p>
<p>Buy $60 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-$8 3/4<br>
Sell $55 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+$5 7/8<br>
Sell $50 put =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>+$4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><br>
Net credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1 1/8</p>
<p>The profit and loss diagrams for the two strategies
look like this:</p>

<img width='300px' src='../images/059.gif'>

<p>Again, we see the ratio spread and Christmas tree
make money if the stock falls below $100.&nbsp; This should
be the case, as both traders own the $100 put.&nbsp; However,
Investor A with the ratio spread will dominate as a
higher credit was received from the initial trade ($3
versus $1-1/8).&nbsp; This can be seen by the fact the red
line is above the blue line through this range.</p>
<p>If the stock falls to $90, the ratio spread will
reach maximum profit of $8 ($5 difference in strike plus
the initial $3 credit).</p>
<p>If the stock falls below $90, the ratio spread starts
to lose profits; the Christmas tree will not start to
lose them until the stock falls below $85.&nbsp; The two
trades are strategies that will be equal at a stock
price of $88.</p>
<p>Below $88, the Christmas tree dominates and we can
see its profit and loss diagram is above the ratio
spreads throughout this range.&nbsp; The ratio spread will
incur losses below the break-even point of $82, while
the Christmas tree's losses will occur below the
break-even point of $79.</p>
<p>The Christmas tree is a nice strategy for those
wanting to utilize short positions to offset the cost of
long positions.&nbsp; They are a nice alternative for ratio
spreads but still have unlimited loss potential, so will
require level 3 option approval from your broker.&nbsp;
Christmas trees are a lower risk, lower reward strategy
relative to the ratio-spread counterpart.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you like to enter ratio spreads, run through some
numbers with the Christmas trees as well.&nbsp; You may find
you like the risk-reward structure much better.</p>
