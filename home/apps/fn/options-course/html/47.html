<h1>Box Spread</h1>

<p>There are many tools that market-makers use to hedge
risks, either partially or fully.&nbsp; One of the most
powerful tools is called a box spread.&nbsp; While this
particular strategy is not widely used by retail
investors, it is very useful in determining if your
vertical spread is priced fairly.</p>
<p>Another important use of the box spread is for
investors who place spread orders (please see our
section on spreads if you are not familiar with these.)&nbsp;
They often ask, &quot;Do you think I can get filled at
such-and-such a price?&quot;&nbsp; If you understand the box
spread, you will be able to immediately determine if
there is any room for the market makers to work with
your order.</p>
<p>If you are a user of spread orders, understanding box
spreads will be a very helpful tool!</p>
<h2>The box spread</h2>
<p>A box spread is a relatively simple strategy.&nbsp; To
enter into a long box position, all you need to do is
buy the bull spread and buy the bear spread with the
same strikes and all other factors the same (if you are
unsure about bull and bear spreads, please see our
section on &quot;Basic Spreads.&quot;)</p>
<p>For example, say a stock is trading at $50.&nbsp; A trader
could buy the Jan $50 call and sell the Jan $55 call
(bull spread), and also buy the Jan $55 put and sell the
Jan $50 put (bear spread.)</p>
<p>This trade will result in a debit for both spreads.&nbsp;
What is interesting about this position is that it is
now <u>guaranteed</u> to be worth $5 (the difference in
strikes) at expiration (keep in mind this is a
theoretical price, and in the real world of trading, the
bid-ask spreads will probably make the value slightly
less than $5 at expiration).</p>
<p>How?&nbsp; Think about this:&nbsp; <b>No matter where the stock
closes, either the $50 call or the $55 put will be
in-the-money</b>.&nbsp; Because these are the two long
positions of the box spread, the trader who buys the box
spread is guaranteed to have a position worth $5 at
expiration.</p>
<p>Let's run through some examples if you are still not
sure:</p>
<p>If the stock closes at $53, the long $50 call will be
worth $3 and the long $55 put will be worth $2 for a
total of $5.&nbsp; The short $55 call and short $50 put will
expire worthless (if you are not sure why these prices
must hold, please see our section under &quot;Basic Option
Pricing&quot;). </p>
<p>If the stock closes at $51, the $50 call will be
worth $1, and the $55 put will be worth $4 for a total
of $5.&nbsp; Again, the two short positions expire worthless.</p>
<p>What if the stock closes outside the ranges of $50
and $55?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the stock closes at, say, $30, the $55 put will be
worth $25 and both calls will expire worthless.&nbsp;
However, the short $50 put now has value.&nbsp; In fact, it
will be worth $20, which is an obligation because the
trader is short.&nbsp; So the total value of the position is
+$25 - $20 = $5.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can't get around it.&nbsp; No matter where the stock
closes, the position will be worth the difference in
strikes, in this case, $5.</p>

<h2>Pricing a box spread</h2>
<p>Now that we know the mechanics of the box spread, how
can we use it to help with our trading?</p>
<p>It is now October 31 and say you are interested in
SCMR, which is currently $58-3/8, with the following
quotes available for options:</p>

</table>
<p>Let's say you are bullish on SCMR and want to place a
$55/$65 bull spread:</p>
<p>Buy Dec $55 Calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$13-7/8<br>
Sell Dec $65 Calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ <u>&nbsp;8-7/8</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;&nbsp;5</p>
<p>Is this being priced fairly?&nbsp; Is it likely we will
get filled if we put a net debit of $4-3/4?</p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, let's look at the
other side of the box spread:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buy Dec $65 Puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$15-3/4 <br>
Sell Dec $55 Puts = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;8-3/4</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;&nbsp;7</p>
<p>Now, you will pay $5 for the bull spread and $7 for
the bear spread for a total debit of $12, which is
guaranteed to fall to a value of $10 at expiration!&nbsp; So
with the current bid/ask spreads, this box is not being
priced fairly.&nbsp; In fact, this is most often the case and
the primary reason the box spread is not a popular tool
for retail investors.</p>
<p>Let's see what the market makers are trying to do.&nbsp;
Remember, the bid represents what they are willing to
pay, and the ask what they are willing to sell.&nbsp; So,
from the market-makers perspective, here is how the box
spread looks:</p>
<p>Buy Dec $55 Calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$12-7/8<br>
Sell Dec $65 Calls =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$<u>&nbsp;9-5/8</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 3-1/4</p>
<p>Buy Dec $65 Puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$14-3/4 <br>
Sell Dec $55 Puts =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;9-1/2</u><br>
Net debit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;&nbsp;5-1/4</p>
<p>The market makers want to complete the box spread for
a total of $8 1/2 points, which is guaranteed to grow to
a value of $10.</p>
<p>On the surface, it appears to be a pretty good deal.&nbsp;
Let's see just how good it is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remember, it is October 31 and we are looking at
December options, which will expire in 45 days.&nbsp; That
actually works out to be 17.6% simple interest, or a
whopping 267% annualized rate of return -- which
certainly beats the guaranteed rates on T-bills.</p>
<p>So to answer the second question: yes there is
certainly a lot of room to work with on the bull spread.</p>
<p>Let's go a step further.&nbsp; Just how much room is
there?&nbsp; One useful method is to start with what the
spread &quot;should&quot; cost.&nbsp; If the spread is guaranteed, it
should earn the risk-free rate (roughly 6%).&nbsp; So the
value of $10 guaranteed in 45 days is about $9.93, which
is roughly $1.17 above the $8-3/4 price the market
makers are trying to pay.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In a case like this, it is very feasible to get 1/2
point or maybe more off of this spread.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please remember, <u>any</u> limit order, no matter
how close to the market, is not guaranteed to fill,&nbsp; so,
if you really need to get into or out of a trade, use
caution in applying this method.&nbsp; This pricing method is
a great tool for analyzing the potential for all traders
who like to use limit orders. </p>
<h2>Uses of the box spread</h2>
<p>Why would a market maker enter into a box spread?&nbsp;
The box spread is effectively a way for market makers to
borrow or lend money.&nbsp; If a market maker sells a box
spread, they are effectively borrowing money.&nbsp; They
receive a credit and must pay back the value of the box
at expiration.&nbsp; Similarly, if they buy a box spread,
they are loaning money.&nbsp; They will pay money but receive
a guaranteed return at expiration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of course, the market makers will price the boxes in
their favor and either buy it below or sell it above the
theoretical fair value.</p>
<p>For example, say a $90/$100 <i>box</i> is priced at
$9.&nbsp; If the $90/$100 <i>put</i> spread is priced at $4,
the $90/$100 <i>call</i> spread should be worth $5.&nbsp;
However, the market maker may bid $4-3/4 and ask $5-1/4
for the call spread.&nbsp; This way, regardless of whether he
buys or sells the call spread, he is either borrowing at
less than (or loaning for a higher rate of) current
risk-free rates by completing the box.&nbsp; For instance, if
he buys the call spread for $4-3/4, he will buy the put
spread for $4 and thus pay only $8-3/4 for a box
position worth $9, and effectively loan money for higher
than the risk-free rate.&nbsp; Likewise, if he sells the bull
spread for $5-1/4, he will sell the bear spread for $4
thereby completing the box for $9-1/4.&nbsp; Now the market
maker has sold a box worth $9 for $9-1/4 and effectively
borrowed money for less than the risk-free rate.</p>
<h2>Other views of the box spread</h2>
<p>We said earlier that a long box spread could be
viewed as a long bull spread matched with a long bear
spread.&nbsp; There are two other ways to view boxes, and
depending on your situation, one or the other may be
more helpful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One way to see it as a conversion at one strike and a
reversal at another.&nbsp; For example, if a trader is short
stock at $50, long $50 calls and short the $50 puts, he
has a reversal at $50.&nbsp; If he subsequently buys stock at
$60 with long $60 puts and short $60 calls, he has a $60
conversion.</p>
<p>Notice that the long and short stock positions cancel
out, leaving the trader with long $50 calls and short
$50 puts (synthetic long position) with long $60 puts
and short $60 calls (synthetic short position).</p>

<p><i>The long and short stock positions cancel
each other out (shown in red).&nbsp; The remaining
positions are a synthetic long position (blue)

$60.&nbsp; Notice the embedded bull and bear spreads
(long $50 call and short $60 call, long $60 put
and short $50 put).</i></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Of course, a long position matched with a short
position cancels each other.&nbsp; This holds true whether
it's actual stock or synthetic versions.&nbsp; The trader who
is synthetic long at $50 and synthetic short at $60 has
effectively purchased stock at $50 and sold at $60.&nbsp;
Bear in mind this is not as good as it seems, as the
trader was also short stock at $50 and long at $60.&nbsp; The
profits or losses come for the total reversal and
conversion prices.</p>
<p>If you trade spreads, take the time to really
understand box positions, as it will make all the
difference in the world in your understanding of spread
pricing.&nbsp; Once you have a handle on that, you will be
able to make more knowledgeable decisions as to which
limits to use with your orders.</p>

<td><b>Answers:</b><br>
What will be the value of the above box spread
if the stock is trading for $100 at expiration?&nbsp;
How would you show it?<p>The question was
referring to the $50/$55 box spread.&nbsp; The value
of the box spread must be worth $5 -- the
difference in strikes -- at expiration.&nbsp; To
prove it, if the stock is trading at $100, the
long $50 call will be worth $50 and the short
$55 call (which is an obligation) will be worth
$45.&nbsp; Both puts, the $50 and $55, will expire
worthless because they are out-of-the-money.&nbsp; So
the total value to the trader will be +$50 - $45
= $5</td>
