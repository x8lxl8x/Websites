<h1>Calendar Spread</h1>

<p>A calendar spread is any spread where the trader buys
a particular month, and then sells the same strike of a
different month.&nbsp; For example, a trader may buy a March
$50 strike and sell a January $50.&nbsp; Notice that the
trader is spreading months, hence the name calendar
spread.&nbsp; Also, because months represent time, these are
equally known as time spreads or horizontal spreads.</p>
<p>If the trade results in a net debit, the trader is
said to be long the calendar spread; if it results in a
net credit, then he is short the spread.</p>
<p>With a calendar spread, the trader is expecting
the stock to sit flat -- this trade is actually a play
on time-decay and volatility as opposed to direction.</p>
<p>Many traders have trouble understanding why you want
the stock to sit still, so let's go through the
reasoning.&nbsp; Say a trader buys the above trade -- long
March $50 for $10 and short Jan $7 for a net debit of
$3.&nbsp; Because the trader is long the spread, he will want
the spread to <u>widen</u> so that he may close it for a
profit.</p>
<p>Now, if the stock sits still, as we approach January
expiration, what will happen to the spread?&nbsp; Both
options will lose money as time goes by, but the short
January option will lose far more than the long March
option.&nbsp; The January will be nearly worthless, while the
March will still have significant time remaining.&nbsp; For
instance, the January option may be trading for $1/2
while the March, with over two months remaining, may be
worth $7.&nbsp; The trader paid $3 and can close it for a net
credit of $6-1/2 for a $3- 1/2 gain.</p>
<p>Let's say the stock nosedives and is trading for
$20.&nbsp; Now, both options will be virtually nothing.&nbsp; You
may see the January for $1/16 and the March for $1/8,
but the point is: the trader will close out the spread
for next to nothing for a loss of about $3.&nbsp; If the
stock collapses, the spread will also collapse toward
zero.</p>
<p>What if the stock rallies and is trading way up?&nbsp; If
the options are very deep-in-the-money, regardless of
the time remaining, they will converge on intrinsic
value.&nbsp; You will see a small difference in the March $50
calls just to reflect an additional two months
cost-of-carry, but the difference will be negligible.</p>
<p>We may see the Jan $50 trading for $30-1/2 and the
Mar $50 for $31 but, again, the spread has narrowed to
1/2 point so the trader will incur a $2-1/2 loss.</p>
<p>From a profit and loss standpoint, the long calendar
spread looks like this:</p>

<p>It should be evident that a long calendar spread
wants the stock to sit still.&nbsp; Conversely, a short
calendar spread will want the stock to move, either up
or down by a large amount as shown by the profit and
loss diagram below:</p>

<p>Many traders make the big mistake of entering into a
calendar spread when bullish on the stock.&nbsp; If they are
lucky enough to get the direction correct, they are
greatly disappointed to see the spread collapse.</p>
<p>If you are bullish or bearish on a particular stock
and entering into a calendar spread, you want to be
short the spread -- you want the spread to narrow.&nbsp; In
other words, if you short the spread, you will receive a
credit.&nbsp; If the stock moves way up or way down, the
spread will narrow and you can purchase it back for a
profit.</p>
<p>If you are expecting the stock to sit still, you want
to be long the spread.&nbsp; You will spend money to do so
but the spread will widen if you are correct and the
stock is relatively quiet.</p>
<p>Calendar spreads add a whole new dimension for most
traders; that is, a limited risk way to profit from a
stock doing nothing.&nbsp; Granted, short calls, short puts
and covered calls can make money from a neutral outlook
on the stock as well.&nbsp; However, their risk with an
adverse move in the underlying is often too big for many
investors.&nbsp; Calendar spreads can be a great way to
profit from a neutral outlook while greatly limiting
your risk.</p>
