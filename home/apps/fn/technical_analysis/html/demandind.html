<h1>Demand Index</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Demand Index combines price and volume in such a way that it is often a leading
indicator of price change. The Demand Index was developed by James Sibbet.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Mr. Sibbet defined six "rules" for the Demand Index:

<OL>
<li>A divergence between the Demand Index and prices suggests an approaching
  weakness in price.</li>

<li>Prices often rally to new highs following an extreme peak in the Demand Index (the
  Index is performing as a leading indicator).</li>

<li>Higher prices with a lower Demand Index peak usually coincides with an important top
  (the Index is performing as a coincidental indicator).</li>

<li>The Demand Index penetrating the level of zero indicates a change in trend (the
  Index is performing as a lagging indicator).</li>

<li>When the Demand Index stays near the level of zero for any length of time, it
  usually indicates a weak price movement that will not last long.</li>

<li>A large long-term divergence between prices and the Demand Index indicates a major
  top or bottom.</li>
</OL></p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Procter & Gamble and the
Demand Index.  A long-term bearish
divergence occurred in 1992 as prices rose while the Demand Index fell.  According to
Sibbet, this indicates a major top.</p>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The Demand Index calculations are too complex for this book (they require 21-columns of
data).</p>
<p>Sibbet's original Index plotted the indicator on a scale labeled +0 at the top, 1 in the
middle, and -0 at the bottom.  Most computer software makes a minor modification to the
indicator so it can be scaled on a normal scale.</p>
