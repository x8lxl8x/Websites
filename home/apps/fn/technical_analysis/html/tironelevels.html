<h1>Tirone Levels</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Tirone Levels are a series of horizontal lines that identify support and resistance
levels.  They were developed by John Tirone.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Tirone Levels can be drawn using either the Midpoint 1/3-2/3 method or the Mean method.
Both methods are intended to help you identify potential support and resistance levels
based on the range of prices over a given time period.  The interpretation of Tirone Levels
is similar to Quadrant Lines.
<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Midpoint Tirone Levels
on Lincoln National.</p>
<img src="../images/tironelevels-1.gif"></p>
The dotted line shows the average price.  The top and bottom lines
divide the range between the highest and lowest prices into thirds.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>
<B>Midpoint Method</B></p>

<p>Midpoint levels are calculated by finding the highest high and the lowest low during the
time period being analyzed.  The lines are then calculated as follows:</p>
<UL>
<li><B>Top line:</B></p> Subtract the lowest low
from the highest high, divide this value by three, and then subtract this result from the
highest high.</li>

<li><B>Center Line:</B></p> Subtract the lowest
low from the highest high, divide this value by two, and then add this result to the lowest
low.</li>

<li><B>Bottom Line:</B></p> Subtract the lowest
low from the highest high, divide this value by three, and then add this result to the
lowest low.</li>
</ul>

Mean Method</p>

Mean levels are displayed as five lines (the spacing between the lines is not necessarily
symmetrical).  The lines are calculated as follows:</p>
<UL>
<li><B>Extreme High:</B></p> Subtract the lowest
low from the highest high and add this value to the Adjusted Mean.</li>

<li><B>Regular High:</B></p> Subtract the lowest low from
the value of the Adjusted Mean multiplied by two.</li>

<li><B>Adjusted Mean:</B></p> This is the sum of
the highest high, the lowest low, and the most recent closing price, divided by three.</li>

<li><B>Regular Low:</B></p> Subtract the highest
high from the value of the Adjusted Mean multiplied by two.</li>

<li><B>Extreme Low:</B></p> Subtract the lowest low
from the highest high and then subtract this value from the Adjusted Mean.</li>
</ul>
