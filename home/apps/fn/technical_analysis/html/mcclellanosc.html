<h1>McClellan OscillatoR</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator that is based on the smoothed
difference between the number of advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>The McClellan Oscillator was developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan. Extensive
coverage of the oscillator is provided in their book
Patterns for Profit.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Indicators that use advancing and declining issues to determine the amount of participation
in the movement of the stock market are called "breadth" indicators.  A healthy bull market
is accompanied by a large number of stocks making moderate upward advances in price.  A
weakening bull market is characterized by a small number of stocks making large advances in
price, giving the false appearance that all is well.  This type of divergence often signals
an end to the bull market.  A similar interpretation applies to market bottoms, where the
market index continues to decline while fewer stocks are declining.</p>
<p>The McClellan Oscillator is one of the most popular breadth indicators (another popular
breadth indicator is the Advance/Decline Line). Buy signals
are typically generated when the McClellan Oscillator falls into the oversold area of -70
to -100 and then turns up.  Sell signals are generated when the oscillator rises into the
overbought area of +70 to +100 and then turns down.</p>
<p>If the oscillator goes beyond these areas (i.e., rises above +100 or falls below -100),
it is a sign of an extremely overbought or oversold condition.  These extreme readings are
usually a sign of a continuation of the current trend.</p>
<p>For example, if the oscillator falls to -90 and turns up, a buy signal is generated.
However, if the oscillator falls below -100, the market will probably trend lower during
the next two or three weeks.  You should postpone buying until the oscillator makes a
series of rising bottoms or the market regains strength.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>
The following chart illustrates the five "trading zones" of the McClellan
Oscillator (i.e., above +100, between +70 and +100, between +70 and -70, between -70 and
-100, and below -100).</p>

This next chart shows the McClellan Oscillator and the Dow Industrials.</p>

I drew "buy"
arrows when the Oscillator rose above -70
and "sell" arrows when the Oscillator fell below +70.  This indicator does an excellent job
of timing entry and exit points.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The McClellan Oscillator is the difference between 10% (approximately 19-day) and 5%
(approximately 39-day) exponential moving averages of advancing minus declining issues.</p>
