<h1>William's &#37; R</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Williams %R (pronounced "percent R") is a momentum indicator that measures overbought/oversold levels. Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams.</p>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>The interpretation of Williams' %R is very similar to that of the Stochastic Oscillator (page 244) except that %R is plotted upside-down and the Stochastic Oscillator has internal smoothing.</p>

<p>To display the Williams %R indicator on an upside-down scale, it is usually plotted using negative values (e.g., -20%).  For the purpose of analysis and discussion, simply ignore the negative symbols.</p>

<p>Readings in the range of 80 to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0 to 20% range suggest that it is overbought.</p>

<p>As with all overbought/oversold indicators, it is best to wait for the security's price to change direction before placing your trades.  For example, if an overbought/oversold indicator (such as the Stochastic Oscillator or Williams' %R) is showing an overbought condition, it is wise to wait for the security's price to turn down before selling the security.  (The MACD is a good indicator to monitor change in a security's price.)  It is not unusual for overbought/oversold indicators to remain in an overbought/oversold condition for a long time period as the security's price continues to climb/fall.  Selling simply because the security appears overbought may take you out of the security long before its price shows signs of deterioration.</p>

<p>An interesting phenomena of the %R indicator is its uncanny ability to anticipate a reversal in the underlying security's price.  The indicator almost always forms a peak and turns down a few days before the security's price peaks and turns down.  Likewise, %R usually creates a trough and turns up a few days before the security's price turns up.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows the OEX index and its 14-day Williams' %R.  I drew "buy" arrows each time the %R formed a trough below 80%.  You can see that in almost every case this occurred one or two days before the prices bottomed.</p>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The formula used to calculate Williams' %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator:
