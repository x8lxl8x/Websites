<h1>Upside/Downside Ratio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Upside/Downside Ratio shows the relationship between up (advancing) and down
(declining) volume on the New York Stock Exchange.

unchanged volume.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>When the Upside/Downside Ratio is greater than 1.0, it is showing that there is more volume
associated with stocks that are increasing in price than with stocks that are decreasing in
price.</p>
<p>While discussing advancing/declining volume in his book,
Winning on Wall Street, Martin Zweig
states, "Every bull market in history, and many good intermediate advances, have been
launched with a buying stampede that included one or more 9-to-1 days" ("9-to-1" refers to
a day were the Upside/Downside Ratio is greater than nine).  He goes on to say, "the 9-to-1
up day is a most encouraging sign, and having two of them within a reasonably short span is
very bullish.  I call it a "double 9-to-1" when two such days occur with three months of
one another."</p>
<p>Table 15 (originally tabulated through 1984 by Martin Zweig) shows all of the
double 9-to-1 buy signals that occurred from 1962 to October 1994.  As of this writing, no
signals have occurred since the last one on June 8, 1988.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows the Dow Jones
Industrial Average during most of the 1980s.</p>
<img src="../images/upsidedownside.gif"></p>
I drew "buy" arrows on the chart where double
9-to-1 buy signals occurred.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

The Upside/Downside Ratio is calculated by dividing the daily volume of advancing stocks by
the daily volume of declining stocks.</p>
