<h1>Chaikin Oscillator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Inspired by the prior work of Joe Granville and Larry Williams, Marc Chaikin developed a
new volume indicator, extending the work done by his predecessors.  The Chaikin Oscillator
is a moving average oscillator based on the
Accumulation/Distribution indicator.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>The following discussion of volume accumulation/distribution interpretation, written by
Marc Chaikin, is reprinted here with his permission:</p>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Technical analysis of both market averages and individual stocks must include
  volume studies in order to give the technician a true picture of the internal
  dynamics of a given market.  Volume analysis helps in identifying internal
  strengths and weaknesses that exist under the cover of price action.  Very often,
  volume divergences versus price movement are the only clues to an important
  reversal that is about to take place.  While volume has always been mentioned by
  technicians as important, little effective volume work was done until Joe Granville
  and Larry Williams began to look at volume versus price in the late 1960s in a more
  creative way.</p>
  <p>For many years it had been accepted that volume and price normally rose and fell
  together, but when this relationship changed, the price action should be examined
  for a possible change of trend.  The Granville OBV concept which views the total
  volume on an up day as accumulation and the total volume on a down day as
  distribution is a decent one, but much too simplistic to be of value.  The reason
  is that there are too many important tops and bottoms, both short-term and
  intermediate-term, where OBV confirms the price extreme.  However, when an OBV line
  gives a divergence signal versus a price extreme, it can be a valuable technical
  signal and usually triggers a reversal in price.</p>
  <p>Larry Williams took the OBV concept and improved on it.  In order to determine
  whether there was accumulation or distribution in the market or an individual
  stock on a given day, Granville compared the closing price to the previous close,
  whereas Williams compared the closing price to the opening price.  He [Williams]
  created a cumulative line by adding a percentage of total volume to the line if
  the close was higher than the opening and, subtracting a percentage of the total
  volume if the close was lower than its opening price.  The
  accumulation/distribution line improved results dramatically over the classic OBV
  approach to volume divergences.</p>
  <p>Williams then took this one step further in analyzing the Dow Jones Industrials
  by creating an oscillator of the accumulation/distribution line for even better buy
  and sell signals.  In the early 1970s, however, the opening price for stocks was
  eliminated from the daily newspaper and Williams' formula became difficult to
  compute without many daily calls to a stockbroker with a quote machine.  Because of
  this void, I created the Chaikin Oscillator substituting the average price of the
  day for Williams' opening and took the approach one step further by applying the
  oscillator to stocks and commodities.  The Chaikin Oscillator is an excellent tool
  for generating buy and sell signals when its action is compared to price movement.
  I believe it is a significant improvement over the work that preceded it.</p>
  <p>The premise behind my oscillator is three-fold.  The first premise is that if a
  stock or market average closes above its midpoint for the day
  (as defined by [high + low] / 2), then there was accumulation on that day.  The
  closer a stock or average closes to its high, the more accumulation there was.
  Conversely, if a stock closes below its midpoint for the day, there was
  distribution on that day.  The closer a stock closes to its low, the more
  distribution there was.</p>
  <p>The second premise is that a healthy advance is accompanied by rising volume
  and a strong volume accumulation.  Since volume is the fuel that powers rallies, it
  follows that lagging volume on rallies is a sign of less fuel available to move
  stocks higher.</p>
  <p>Conversely, declines are usually accompanied by low volume, but end with
  panic-like liquidation on the part of institutional investors.  Thus, we look for
  a pickup in volume and then lower-lows on reduced volume with some accumulation
  before a valid bottom can develop.</p>
  <p>The third premise is that by using the Chaikin Oscillator, you can monitor the
  flow of volume into and out of the market.  Comparing this flow to price action can
  help identify tops and bottoms, both short-term and intermediate-term.</p>
  <p>Since no technical approach works all the time, I suggest using the oscillator
  along with other technical indicators to avoid problems.  I favor using a
  price envelope around a 21-day moving average and an
  overbought/oversold oscillator together with the Chaikin Oscillator for the best
  short and intermediate-term technical signals.</p>
  <p>The most important signal generated by the Chaikin Oscillator occurs when prices
  reach a new high or new low for a swing, particularly at an overbought or oversold
  level, and the oscillator fails to exceed its previous extreme reading and then
  reverses direction.</p>

  <p><OL>
  <li>Signals in the direction of the intermediate-term trend are more reliable than
  those against the trend.</li>

  <li>A confirmed high or low does not imply any further price action in that
  direction.  I view that as a non-event.</li>
  </OL></p>

  <p>A second way to use the Chaikin Oscillator is to view a change of direction in
  the oscillator as a buy or sell signal, but only in the direction of the trend.
  For example, if we say that a stock that is above its 90-day moving average of
  price is in an uptrend, then an upturn of the oscillator while in negative
  territory would constitute a buy signal only if the stock were above its 90-day
  moving average--not below it.</p>
  <p>A downturn of the oscillator while in positive territory (above zero) would be a
  sell signal if the stock were below its 90-day moving average of closing
  prices."</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Eastman Kodak and
the Chaikin Oscillator.  Bearish divergences (where prices increased to new highs while the
Oscillator was falling) occurred at points "A" and "B."  These divergences were warnings of
the sell-offs that followed.</p>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The Chaikin Oscillator is created by subtracting a 10-period exponential moving average of
the Accumulation/Distribution Line from a 3-period
exponential moving average of the Accumulation/Distribution Line.</p>
