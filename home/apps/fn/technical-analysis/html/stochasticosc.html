<h1>Stochastic Oscillator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><B>Sto.chas.tic</B> (sto kas'tik) adj. 2. Math. designating a process having
an infinite progression of jointly distributed random variables.<br><CITE>--- Webster's New
World Dictionary</CITE></p>
<p>The Stochastic Oscillator compares where a security's price closed relative to its price
range over a given time period.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>The Stochastic Oscillator is displayed as two lines.  The main line is called "%K."  The
second line, called "%D," is a moving average of %K.  The %K line is usually displayed as a
solid line and the %D line is usually displayed as a dotted line.</p>
<p>There are several ways to interpret a Stochastic Oscillator.  Three popular methods
include:</p>
<OL>
<li>Buy when the Oscillator (either %K or %D) falls below a specific level (e.g., 20) and
then rises above that level. Sell when the Oscillator rises above a specific level
(e.g., 80) and then falls below that level.</li>

<li>Buy when the %K line rises above the %D line and sell when the %K line falls below
the %D line.</li>

<li<p>Look for divergences.  For example, where
prices are making a series of new highs and the Stochastic Oscillator is failing to surpass
its previous highs.</p>
</OL>
<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Avon Products
and its 10-day Stochastic.</p>

I drew "buy" arrows when the %K line fell below, and
then rose above, the level of 20.  Similarly, I drew "sell" arrows when the %K line rose
above, and then fell below, the level of 80.</p>
<p>This next chart also shows Avon Products.</p>
<img src="../images/stochasticoscillator-2.gif"></p>
In this example I drew "buy" arrows each time the %K line rose above the %D
(dotted).  Similarly, "sell" arrows were drawn when the %K line fell below the %D line.</p>
<p>This final chart shows a divergence
between the Stochastic Oscillator and prices.</p>
<img src="../images/stochasticoscillator-3.gif"></p>
This is a classic divergence where prices
are headed higher, but the underlying indicator (the Stochastic Oscillator) is moving
lower.  When a divergence occurs between an indicator and prices, the indicator typically
provides the clue as to where prices will head.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The Stochastic Oscillator has four variables:</p>
<OL>
<LI><h2>%K Periods.</h2>  This is the number of time periods used in the stochastic
calculation.</p>

<LI><h2>%K Slowing Periods.</h2>  This value controls the internal smoothing of %K.  A
value of 1 is considered a fast stochastic; a value of 3 is considered a slow
stochastic.</p>

<LI><h2>%D Periods.</h2>  This is the number of time periods used when calculating a
moving average of %K.  The moving average is called "%D" and is usually displayed as a
dotted line on top of %K.</p>

<LI><h2>%D Method.</h2>  The method (i.e., Exponential, Simple, Time Series, Triangular,
Variable, or Weighted) that is used to calculate %D.</p>
</OL>
<p>The formula for %K is:</p>
<P><img src="../images/stochasticoscalc1.gif"></p>

<p>For example, to calculate a 10-day %K, first find the security's highest-high and
lowest-low over the last 10 days.  As an example, let's assume that during the last 10 days
the highest-high was 46 and the lowest-low was 38--a range of 8 points.  If today's closing
price was 41, %K would be calculated as:</p>
<P><img src="../images/stochasticoscalc2.gif"></p>
<p>The 37.5% in this example shows that today's close was at the level of 37.5% relative to
the security's trading range over the last 10 days.  If today's close was 42, the
Stochastic Oscillator would be 50%.  This would mean that that the security closed today at
50%, or the mid-point, of its 10-day trading range.</p>
<p>The above example used a %K Slowing Period of 1-day (no slowing).  If you use a value
greater than one, you average the highest-high and the lowest-low over the number of %K
Slowing Periods before performing the division.</p>
<p>A moving average of %K is then calculated using the number of time periods specified in
the %D Periods.  This moving average is called %D.</p>
<p>The Stochastic Oscillator always ranges between 0% and 100%.  A reading of 0% shows that
the security's close was the lowest price that the security has traded during the preceding
x-time periods.  A reading of 100% shows that the security's close was the highest price
that the security has traded during the preceding x-time periods.</p>
