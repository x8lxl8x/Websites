<h1>Absolute Breadth Index</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Absolute Breadth Index ("ABI") is a market momentum indicator that was developed by
Norman G. Fosback.</p>
<p>The ABI shows how much activity, volatility, and change is taking place on the New York
Stock Exchange while ignoring the direction prices are headed.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>You can think of the ABI as an "activity index."  High readings indicate market
activity and change, while low readings indicate lack of change.</p>
<p>In Fosback's book, Stock Market Logic, he
indicates that historically, high values
typically lead to higher prices three to twelve months later.  Fosback found that a highly
reliable variation of the ABI is to divide the weekly ABI by the total issues traded.  A
ten-week moving average of this value is then calculated.  Readings above 40% are very
bullish and readings below 15% are bearish.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows the S&P 500 and a 5-week moving average of the
ABI.</p>

Strong rallies occurred every time the ABI's moving average rose above 310.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The Absolute Breadth Index is calculated by taking the absolute value of the
difference between NYSE Advancing Issues and NYSE Declining Issues.</p>

<p>Absolute value (i.e., ABS) means "regardless of sign."  Thus, the absolute
value of -100 is 100 and the absolute value of +100 is also 100.</p>
