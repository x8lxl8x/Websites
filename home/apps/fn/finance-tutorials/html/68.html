<h1>Fund Investment Qualities</h1>



<p>For the vast majority of the general public, investing means investing in mutual funds. These convenient investment vehicles provide investors with a relatively easy-to-use, effective means to accumulate savings over the long run. Because of the mutual fund's important role in the investment activities of individual investors, it is necessary that they understand how to make informed decisions regarding fund selection and monitoring. </p>
<p>Whether you are a do-it-yourselfer, use an investment professional, or are a participant in a self-directed retirement plan, being reasonably conversant with the ABCs of a mutual fund is a valuable investing skill. Even if you do not have all the answers to the questions surrounding successful fund investing, you should at least be equipped with sufficient know-how to ask intelligent questions. </p>
<p>With the mutual fund universe at 8,000 plus and growing, there are, for many investors, just too many choices. The problem of choice is further complicated by an information overload, which requires investors to sort out what is nice to know and what they need to know. </p>
<p>Let's summarize the main points of assessing the investment qualities of a mutual fund, where to find this information and how to use it to make smart fund decisions. </p>
<p><strong>Fund Investment Qualities</strong></p>
<p>There are dozens of analytical financial metrics that can be used to evaluate a mutual fund. Some are quite complicated and difficult to apply. Here, we've covered just eight fundamental evaluative criteria, or investment qualities.</p>
<p>A fund investor would be well served to focus his or her attention on these summarized criteria:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.1: Investing Style Considerations </strong></p>
<p>Evidence of a fund manager's ability and commitment, over the course of several years, to manage a mutual fund's assets according to its stated investment objective and avoid excessive style drift. (To learn more, read <em>Focus Pocus May Not Lead To Magical Returns</em> and <em>Don't Panic If Your Mutual Fund Is Drifting</em>.)</p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.2: Favorable Risk-Return Profile </strong></p>
<p>Evidence of a fund manager's ability to effectively manage a mutual fund's assets by consistently producing as positive an investment risk-return spread as possible over the course of several years. (To learn more, read <em>Financial Concepts: The Risk/Return Tradeoff</em>.)</p>
<p></li><li><strong>Investment-Quality No.3: Fund Size and Style Compatibility </strong></p>
<p>Recognition by the fund's manager that it is prudent to keep the size of a fund's asset base compatible with its investing style. (To learn more, read <em>Are Bigger Fund Always Better?</em>)</p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.4: Manager Tenure &amp; Structure </strong></p>
<p>A long-term fund performance record, preferably 10 years long, provides the best indicator of a manager's investing abilities. Accordingly, it is critical that managerial tenure and fund performance match each other over a meaningful time span. </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.5: Low Portfolio Turnover </strong></p>
<p>Whatever the category of mutual fund being considered, the lower the portfolio turnover percentage, the better, in terms of minimizing the cost of transaction commissions, which are not included in a fund's expense ratio.</p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.6: Be a Cost-Conscious Investor </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to mutual fund costs and expenses, a mutual fund's investment quality increases with the absence of sales charges and 12b-1 fees and the presence of low expense and portfolio turnover ratios. Low-cost funds outperform high-cost funds. (For more on this topic, read <em>Stop Paying High Fees</em>.)</p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality No.7: Comparative Total Returns </strong></p>
<p>A mutual fund's total return investment quality is evidenced by relatively consistent positive performance as compared to its peers, its category benchmark and an appropriate broad market index over five- and 10-year periods. (A 10-year period is preferable.) </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Fund Investment-Quality Number 8: Favorable Analytics </strong></p>
<p>Positive analytical commentary by investment research analysts is an important indicator of mutual fund investment quality. </li></ul></p>

<h2>Fund I-Q Scorecard</h2>



<p>In general, scorecards are a handy tool to record the results of any number of sporting events, be that a round of golf or a baseball game. Essentially, a scorecard collects a variety of quantitative data (numbers), which are used by players, coaches, referees, umpires and judges to keep track, in an orderly fashion, of certain facets and results of the game being played. </p>
<p>So it is with a Fund Investment-Quality Scorecard (FIQS) for mutual funds. When it comes to selecting and deciding to hold mutual funds, investors need to know the "score." The purpose of the Fund I-Q Scorecard is to help fund investors to collect key data in an organized and focused fashion and to make informed judgments as to the investment quality of a mutual fund investment opportunity. </p>
<p>Users of the FIQS need to recognize that, unlike a sporting event, not all of the information in this scorecard is purely quantitative. In other words, there is room for qualitative judgments, which may vary depending on how a given investor interprets the data presented. Investors with different mindsets will see things differently. </p>
<p>This element of subjectivity in evaluating the results of a mutual fund's scorecard rating should not be material. The majority of a fund's investment qualities are quantifiable - the risk-return profile, managerial tenure and structure, portfolio turnover, expense ratio and total returns. The point to keep in mind is that the FIQS is not meant to produce a rigid, numerical rating. What is intended is to provide an informational framework that allows an investor to make a common-sense evaluative judgment on the merits, or lack thereof, of a mutual fund. </p>
<p>As a user of the Fund Investment-Quality Scorecard, do not worry about being 100% correct on each and every data point. The benefit from this investment research tool is that it helps fund investors organize their thoughts on the pros and cons of a mutual fund investment opportunity, which should lead to an informed investing decision. </p>

<p><strong>The Fund Investment Qualities in Action</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at the Dodge &amp; Cox Stock (DODGX) fund in order to provide readers with an idea of how all this theory works in practice, using the illustrative fund reports from Morningstar (see the PDF of this report here) and Value Line (see the PDF of this report here).</p>
<p>So in terms of the fund investment qualities for DODGX: </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.1: DODGX's Investment Style</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, while there has been some minor inconsistency, it probably isn't material, and moving into the large cap blend box is not any great departure from the fund's value objective. The consistency of the fund's management investment style appears to be favorable, falling somewhere between stable and minor change. Also, DODGX's superior total return performance indicates that the fund's managers seem to be making smart decisions. </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.2: DODGX's</strong> <strong>Risk-Return Spread</strong> </p>
<p>DODGX's risk-return spread is positive, which meets an indispensable investing requirement. </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.3: DODGX's Size and Style Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>The fund's $52.2 billion in assets increased some 272% from year-end 2002 to year-end 2005! There are only 87 holdings in the portfolio, which implies some rather large individual holdings. Morningstar's research analyst comments on this circumstance as a "challenge." The fund has been closed for some time, and returns continue to be high, registering above all the fund's benchmarks. The fund's size is a concern and needs to be watched. As long as the fund's total return numbers do not suffer, the situation seems under control. (To learn more, read <em>Are Bigger Funds Always Better?</em>) </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No. 4: DODGX's Management</strong> <strong>Tenure and Structure</strong></p>
<p>This fund's team management approach assures continuity and obviates any concern over a match of manager tenure and fund performance. (For more on team management, read <em>Mutual Fund Management: Team Players Or All-Stars?</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.5: DODGX's Portfolio Turnover Ratio</strong></p>
<p>The fund's historical record of low portfolio turnover is very positive; way below industry and peer group percentages. This fund investment quality is important for a fund of this size. </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.6: DODGX's Costs</strong></p>
<p>DODGX's modest expense ratio makes it a low-cost performer with no sales charges or objectionable 12b-1 fees applied. This is a highly favorable fund investment quality. </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.7: DODGX's Total Returns</strong></p>
<p>Over all the periods measured, DODGX's total return performance is simply outstanding - a very impressive long-term record. </p>
<p><strong>Fund I-Q No.8: DODGX's Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, Dodge &amp; Cox's reputation as one of the most respected fund companies in the industry is confirmed by its top-rated fund stewardship. Morningstar's "Take" on this fund is very favorable, and it is designated as an Analyst Pick. Overall, this fund shows a high investment quality rating. </p>
