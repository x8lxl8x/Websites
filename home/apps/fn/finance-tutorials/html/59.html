<h1>Top ETFs and What They Track: Introduction to ETFs</h1>

<p>Before we dive in to discover the top ETFs, let’s make a brief review of what ETFs are and what makes them an interesting investment.</p>


<h2>  What Are ETFs?</h2>
<p>An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that tracks an index, specific asset or basket of assets to which it is pegged. ETFs are bought and sold throughout the day like securities on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>ETFs cover many areas of the market including stock indexes, stock market sectors, commodities, currencies, bonds and even instruments that track the volatility of the stock market.</p>
<p>In some ways, ETFs might appear comparable to mutual funds, in that both involve a pool of assets. But these two types of funds actually operate quite differently. Unlike a mutual fund that has its net-asset value (NAV) calculated at the end of each trading day, the price of ETFs price fluctuates with supply and demand during the regular stock market trading session. (For more on a comparison between ETFs and mutual funds, see <u>Mutual Funds vs. ETFs: A Comparison.</u>)</p>



<h2>  Origins of ETFs</h2>
<p>ETFs were originally created to track various market indexes. The first ETF was the Index Participation Shares, introduced in 1989 and aimed to track the S&amp;P 500. Toronto Index Participation Shares  (TIPS) was introduced in Canada in 1990 by the Toronto stock exchange to track an index of major Canadian companies TSE 35 and later TSE 100.</p>
<p>In 1993, the SPDR S&amp;P 500, which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index, was launched. It trades under the symbol SPY. SPDR has since become a juggernaut among ETFs.</p>


<h2>  Growth of the ETF Market</h2>
<p>The popularity and variety of ETFs available has grown tremendously over the past decade. According to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the number of ETFs has grown from 102 in 2001 to 1,194 in 2012 with total net assets of more than $1.3 trillion.</p>


<h2>  Advantages of ETFs</h2>
<ul><li>    <strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Annual management expenses of ETFs are typically substantially lower than those of mutual funds. ETFs are also free of "loads," the entry and exit fees that some mutual funds charge. It is often pointed out that many mutual funds fail to beat benchmark indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. However, the fact that ETFs are now available to inexpensively and effectively track these indexes highlights their potential appeal to investors. Why pay high fees to enter a mutual fund that may fail to beat an index such as the S&amp;P 500 when you can buy an ETF that efficiently tracks the benchmark index with a very low management fee?</li>
<li>    <strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> Due to low turnover and the way they are structured, ETFs are typically more tax efficient than comparable mutual funds.</li>
<li>    <strong>Diversification:</strong> ETFs allow investors to invest in a broad array of markets that they may not otherwise have had access to. For example, prior to the advent of ETFs, investors would have needed access to trade the futures markets in order to trade commodities such as gold. The ability to easily allocate assets into a diverse range of markets empowers investors to better manage their risk against adverse moves in the market.</li>
<li>    <strong>Versatility</strong><strong>:</strong> ETFs are traded throughout the day in the same way as stocks, their prices fluctuating with supply and demand in the market. Investors can sell ETFs short and use all the various order types used with stocks to enter and exit the market. ETFs normally have the same commissions as stocks and can be traded on margin. Additionally, the barriers to entry are low, as an investor can purchase as little as one share of an ETF.</li>
<li>    <strong>Transparency</strong><strong>:</strong> Unlike mutual funds, the holdings of an indexed ETF are readily visible, either in their prospectus or on their website, so you can always know what you own. While mutual funds are only required to disclose their portfolios on a quarterly or semiannual basis, all "actively managed" ETFs must by law disclose their full portfolios every day. Active management refers to the use of a discretionary element, where management actively decides on which assets to include in a fund.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Top ETFs and What They Track: Global And Emerging Market ETFs</h2>

<p>Global and emerging market ETFs allow investors to diversify their investments away from the United States and profit from the growth of foreign economies.</p>
<p>According to 2012 estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), emerging economies are expected to grow two or three times faster than developed economies like the United States.</p>
<p>Among the attractive qualities of emerging markets economies are the growing working populations, increasing levels of consumption, and relatively low debt levels.</p>
<p>Investors look to emerging markets for relatively high potential returns driven by the potentially high economic growth rates. However, emerging market investments also come with greater risks, such as potential political instability, currency exchange rate fluctuations and lower levels of liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF</strong></p>
<p>The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) is a giant in the world of ETFs with assets under management of over $40 billion as of 2013. It is also one of the most actively traded ETFs in the world, with an average daily volume of over 60 million shares traded.</p>
<p>The Fund tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Free Index, which is designed to measure equity market performance in the global emerging markets.</p>

<p>As of 2013 the MSCI Emerging Markets Index covers 21 emerging market countries, including Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Launched in 2003, the fund is managed by BlackRock and has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.67%.</p>
<p><strong>Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF</strong></p>
<p>The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO), tracks the performance of the FTSE Emerging Index. This market-capitalization weighted index measures the performance of approximately 850 large and mid-cap companies in 22 emerging markets.</p>
<p>Launched in 2005, VWO has assets under management of over $47 billion as of 2013. While the fund is less liquid than EEM, with an average daily volume of 17 million shares traded, it has a lower expense ratio of 0.18%.</p>
<p><strong>iShares MSCI EAFE ETF</strong></p>
<p>Focused on developed economies, iShares MSCI EAFE (NYSE:EFO) is another massive global ETF. As of November 2013 the fund has assets under management of over $50 billion and an average volume of over 15 million shares traded daily. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.34%.</p>
<p>EFO tracks the MSCI EAFE Index, which covers large- and mid-cap stocks based in developed market</p>


<h2>Top ETFs and What They Track: Stock Index ETFs</h2>

<p>ETFs tracking stock indexes figure prominently among the leading ETFs measured by assets under management and trading volume.</p>
<p>Trading stock index ETFs allows investors to get exposure to the broader market with the same ease as buying a single stock.</p>
<p>Stock index ETFs can also be used for hedging market exposure.<em> </em>For example, long positions in the stock market could be hedged by short selling a stock index ETF or by buying an inverse stock index ETF.<em> </em>The high levels of liquidity and volatility along with the availability of low commission rates to enter and exit trades have also made them popular among day traders.</p>
<p>Major factors that influence the movement of stock index ETFs include earnings reports, economic data and geopolitical news.</p>
<p>Stock index ETFs are designed to closely track their underlying indexes and consequently their price movement mirrors that of the index they follow.</p>
<p><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF</strong></p>
<p>In January of 1993, State Street Global Advisors launched the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY). Its shares are sometimes referred to as "spiders," a wordplay on the ticker symbol.</p>
<p>The SPDR tracks the S&amp;P 500, an index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies with common stock listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq. Broader than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes only 30 companies, SPDR is a widely used benchmark of the U.S. stock market.</p>
<p>Simply put, an increase or decrease in the S&amp;P 500 Index is matched by a commensurate upward or downward move in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF.</p>
<p>SPDR is the world’s largest ETF, with colossal net assets under management (AUM) of over $160 billion as of 2013.</p>
<p>With a massive average daily volume of over 100 million shares, it is also the most liquid ETF in the world. SPDR trades on NYSE ArcaExchange and has a low net expense ratio of 0.0945%.</p>
<p><strong>iShares Russell 2000</strong></p>
<p>The second most actively traded stock index ETF as of 2013 is the iShares Russell 2000 (NYSE:IWM), which tracks the broad based Russell 2000 Index.</p>

<p>The  iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF provides investors access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. The Russell 2000 Index is made up of the smallest 2000 companies in the Russell 3000 Index.</p>
<p>Small-cap stocks offer large growth potential but come with a higher degree of risk. Historically, small-cap stocks have performed well during rising interest rate environments.</p>
<p>When the Russell 2000 Index moves up or down, an equivalent move is seen in the iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF. </p>
<p>Launched in May of 2000, the fund has net assets under management of over $24 billion as of 2013. Another highly liquid ETF, IWM has an average daily volume of over 37 million and relatively high expense ratio of 0.24%.</p>
<p><strong>PowerShares QQQ</strong></p>
<p>Launched in October of 1999 by Invesco Powershares Capital Management, the Powershares QQQ (Nasdaq:QQQ) tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index includes the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq by market capitalization.</p>
<p>As of 2013, QQQ has assets under management of over $40 billion and an average daily volume over 30 million. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.20%.</p>
<p><strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong></p>
<p>One of the first stock index ETFs, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) launched in 1998.</p>
<p>Its shares are sometimes referred to as "diamonds," a wordplay on the ticker symbol. The fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors and tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a price-weighted index of 30 "blue-chip" U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and most closely followed stock market benchmarks in the world.</p>
<p>As of 2013, the fund has net assets under management of over $11 billion, an average daily volume of over 6 million contracts traded and an expense ratio of 0.17%.</p>
<p><strong>Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF</strong></p>
<p>Launched in 2001, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:VTI) caters to investors looking for the broadest exposure to the U.S. stock market. The fund provides a simple and inexpensive way to diversify a large cap portfolio.</p>
<p>VTI tracks the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, a benchmark that measures the investment return of the overall U.S. stock market. The index includes large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</p>
<p>As of 2013, the fund is one of the largest in the world, with assets under management of over $280 billion. VTI has an average daily volume of over 2 million and a very low expense ratio of 0.05%.</p>


<h2>Top ETFs and What They Track: Volatility ETFs</h2>

<p>Sometimes referred to as the "fear index," the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX) was created in 1993 as a means to track stock market volatility. Since then, the VIX has become the leading gauge of investor sentiment and short-term volatility.</p>
<p>The VIX reflects the market's expectation of 30 day S&amp;P 500 volatility based on the prices of options on the S&amp;P 500 index. The price of VIX often moves in the opposite direction of the S&amp;P 500, trading higher when fear in the market rises.</p>
<p>VIX ETFs can be used to hedge investments in the market or to speculate on potential sell-offs.</p>
<p><strong>Barclays Bank PLC iPath S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN</strong></p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange Traded Note (NYSE:VXX) is the largest and most popular volatility ETN.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009 and managed by Barclays iPath, as of November 2013 VXX has assets under management of over $1 billion and an expense ratio of 0.89%.</p>
<p>VXX tracks the implied volatility of the S&amp;P 500 by taking a daily rolling long position in VIX futures. Rather than a long term holding, VXX is widely seen as a tool to hedge against risk in short term investments or as a way to speculate on short term volatility.</p>
<p><strong>VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN</strong></p>
<p>Launched in 2010, VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN (Nasdaq:XIV) tracks the inverse of the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures index.</p>
<p>This fund caters to investors aiming to profit from a decrease in market volatility. As an inverse ETF, the price of XIV rises as the VIX falls.</p>
<p>As of November 2013, XIV has assets under management of over $350 million, an average daily volume of over 8 million shares and a high expense ratio of 1.35%.</p>


<h2>Top ETFs and What They Track: REIT ETFs</h2>

<p>Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are securities traded on stock exchanges that invest directly in real estate, both through properties and mortgages.</p>
<p>REITs provide an easy way to access the real estate market. The fact that they trade on major exchanges means that they are highly liquid. REITs offer diversification in that historically they have had a low correlation to the stock market.</p>
<p>REITs receive special tax considerations and typically offer investors higher yields than stocks. While REITs are more volatile than bonds they offer a greater potential appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Vanguard REIT ETF</strong></p>
<p>The Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSE:VNQ), is the largest fund in the sector, with assets under management of over $17 billion as of November 2013. Launched in 2004, the fund tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, formerly called Morgan Stanley REIT Index. VNQ holds a broad portfolio of U.S. focused REITs.</p>
<p>The price value of VNQ rises and falls based on the movements of the index which covers about two-thirds of the value of the entire U.S. REIT market. VNQ has a low expense ratio of 0.10% and an average daily volume of over 2.7 million shares.</p>


<h2>Top ETFs and What They Track: Commodity ETFs</h2>

<p>Commodities are an example of an asset class that was less accessible to retail investors until recent years. Prior to the advent of ETFs, commodity investors were broadly limited to the futures market.</p>
<p>Commodity prices usually rise when inflation is accelerating, making them an important hedge against rising prices, potentially protecting the purchasing power of investor capital.</p>
<p>Commodities are also valuable in terms of diversification. Bonds are only minimally correlated with stocks, making them an effective tool in diversifying investments. Commodities provide even further diversification in that they have been negatively correlated to both stocks and bonds historically.</p>
<p>Commodities such as gold are also often looked to as safe havens in periods of geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>SPDR Gold Shares</strong></p>
<p>State Street Global Advisors introduced the first gold ETF in November 2004, called SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD).</p>
<p>The fund was designed to track the spot price of gold bullion. Each share represents ownership in one tenth of an ounce of gold held by the fund.</p>
<p>The SPDR Gold Shares is physically backed, meaning that the shares they issue are backed by their holdings of the precious metal. The gold is held in HSBC’s vault in London.</p>
<p>As the price of gold rises or falls, GLD moves up or down. Key factors that influence the price movement in gold prices include the level of production, the level of demand, the value of the U.S. dollar and central bank policy.</p>
<p>One of the largest ETFs in the world, as of 2013 GLD has over $33 billion in net assets under management.</p>
<p>The fund is has an average daily volume of over 8 million shares. The expense ratio of 0.40% is substantially higher than the stock index ETFs covered earlier. (To learn more about gold ETFs, read The Gold Showdown: ETFs vs. Futures)</p>
<p><strong>iShares Silver Trust</strong></p>
<p>The second largest ETF covering a single commodity is the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Launched in 2006 and managed by BlackRock, the iShares Silver Trust is designed to track the spot price of silver bullion.</p>
<p>In comparison to gold, silver has many industrial uses and its price is more volatile due to having a smaller market size.</p>
<p>Similar to GLD, a share of SLV represents ownership of slightly less than one ounce of silver. Major factors influencing the price of silver include industrial and consumer demand, the value of gold and the value of the U.S. Dollar.</p>
<p>Considerably smaller than the SPDR Gold Trust, as of 2013 the iShares Silver Trust has assets under management of over $6 billion, an average daily volume of over 8 million shares, and an expense ratio of 0.50%.</p>
<p><strong>United States Oil Fund LP</strong></p>
<p>Crude oil, sometimes called "black gold" is another of the most important and closely watched commodities in the world.</p>

<p>As of 2013, the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) is the largest crude oil ETF by assets under management and average daily volume of contracts traded.</p>
<p>Launched in 2006, the fund tracks the price of light, sweet crude oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX, owned and operated by CME Group).</p>
<p>In many cases, such as the United States Oil Fund, ETFs invest in the futures market due to the high levels of liquidity available.</p>
<p>NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures are the world's most liquid crude oil benchmark and the world's most actively traded energy product.</p>
<p>Factors that influence the price of crude oil include supply in terms of output, the level of oil reserves, the level of demand and geopolitical news. Rising levels of output and reserves tend to force crude oil prices lower, while declining levels push the price of crude oil higher. Geopolitical news and events, particularly out of the Middle East, can influence the price of oil. A perceived threat to levels of supply will push oil prices higher.</p>
<p>The fund is much smaller than GLD or SLV, with assets under management of approximately $1.2 billion as of November 2013. USO has an average daily volume of over 5 million shares and an expense ratio of 0.45%.</p>
<p><strong>United States Natural Gas Fund LP</strong></p>
<p>The United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSE:UNG), launched in 2007, is another major ETF in the energy sector. The fund tracks NYMEX natural gas futures, the most liquid natural gas contract.</p>
<p>Factors that influence the price of natural gas include production levels, imports, underground storage levels, seasonal weather and petroleum prices. As with crude oil, increases in the level of production and reserves will typically pressure the price of natural gas lower and vice versa for decreasing levels. The weather and petroleum prices affect levels of demand. Petroleum is viewed as a potential substitute for natural gas in some cases.</p>
<p>As of November 2013, the fund has assets under management of over $1 billion, an average daily volume of over 4 million shares and an expense ratio of 0.60%.</p>
<p><strong>Powershares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund</strong></p>
<p>Launched in 2006, the Powershares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (NYSE:DBC) provides an option for investors looking to invest in a basket of commodities.</p>
<p>The fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index, made up of  futures contracts on 14 of the most liquid physical commodities in the world, covering energy, agriculture, and metals. The commodities included in the index are light sweet crude oil (WTI), heating oil, RBOB gasoline, natural gas, Brent crude, gold, silver, aluminum, zinc, copper corn, wheat, soybeans, and sugar.</p>
<p>Major factors that influence the prices of commodities as a whole include supply and demand, levels of stock, currency exchange rates and the level of inflation.</p>
<p>As of November 2013 the fund has assets of over $5 billion, an average daily volume of over 1.6 million shares. And an expense ratio of 0.93%.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>The rapid expansion of the ETF universe bears testimony to their popularity with investors and their effectiveness in enabling broad ranging asset allocation. ETFs provide a versatile and cost-efficient portfolio diversification vehicle for both small and large investors alike. Importantly, in contrast to mutual funds, the high level of transparency offered by ETFs empowers investors, in that they can have a more clear understanding of what they are investing in.</p>
