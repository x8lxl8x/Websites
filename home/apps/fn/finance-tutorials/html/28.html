<h1>Risk and Diversification: Introduction</h1>







</p>
<p>With the markets moving up and down like a Six Flags roller coaster, is there anything you can do to stomach the risk? Have you carefully considered the various risks that are associated with each investment you make? </p>

<p>The fact is, many people either have no desire or no knowledge about how to protect themselves from unneeded risk. In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to risk and give you a good foundation to understand the relationship between return and risk. (For related reading on this topic, see <EM>Determining Risk And The Risk Pyramid</EM> and <em>The Equity Risk Premium - Part 1</em> and <em>Part 2</em>.) </p>
<p>

<h2>Risk and Diversification: What Is Risk?</h2>


<p>Whether it is investing, driving, or just walking down the street, everyone exposes themselves to risk. Your personality and lifestyle play a big role in how much risk you are comfortably able to take on. If you invest in stocks and have trouble sleeping at night, you are probably taking on too much risk. (For more insight, see <em>A Guide To Portfolio Construction</em>.) </p>

<p>Risk is defined as the chance that an investment's actual return will be different than expected. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. </p>
<p>Those of us who work hard for every penny we earn have a harder time parting with money. Therefore, people with less disposable income tend to be, by necessity, more risk averse. On the other end of the spectrum, day traders feel if they aren't making dozens of trades a day there is a problem. These people are risk lovers. </p>
<p>When investing in stocks, bonds, or any investment instrument, there is a lot more risk than you'd think. In the next section, we'll take a look at the different kind of risk that often threaten investors' returns. </p>



<h2>Risk and Diversification: Different Types of Risk</h2>

<p></p>

<p>Let's take a look at the two basic types of risk: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Systematic Risk</strong> - Systematic risk influences a large number of assets. A significant political event, for example, could affect several of the assets in your portfolio. It is virtually impossible to protect yourself against this type of risk. </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Unsystematic Risk</strong> - Unsystematic risk is sometimes referred to as "specific risk". This kind of risk affects a very small number of assets. An example is news that affects a specific stock such as a sudden strike by employees. Diversification is the only way to protect yourself from unsystematic risk. (We will discuss diversification later in this tutorial). </p>
<p>Now that we've determined the fundamental types of risk, let's look at more specific types of risk, particularly when we talk about stocks and bonds. </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Credit or Default Risk</strong> - Credit risk is the risk that a company or individual will be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on its debt obligations. This type of risk is of particular concern to investors who hold bonds in their portfolios. Government bonds, especially those issued by the federal government, have the least amount of default risk and the lowest returns, while corporate bonds tend to have the highest amount of default risk but also higher interest rates. Bonds with a lower chance of default are considered to be investment grade, while bonds with higher chances are considered to be junk bonds. Bond rating services, such as Moody's, allows investors to determine which bonds are investment-grade, and which bonds are junk. (To read more, see <em>Junk Bonds: Everything You Need To Know</em>, <em>What Is A Corporate Credit Rating</em> and <em>Corporate Bonds: An Introduction To Credit Risk</em>.)    </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Country Risk</strong> - Country risk refers to the risk that a country won't be able to honor its financial commitments. When a country defaults on its obligations, this can harm the performance of all other financial instruments in that country as well as other countries it has relations with. Country risk applies to stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options and futures that are issued within a particular country. This type of risk is most often seen in emerging markets or countries that have a severe deficit. (For related reading, see <em>What Is An Emerging Market Economy?</em>) </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Foreign-Exchange Risk</strong> - When investing in foreign countries you must consider the fact that currency exchange rates can change the price of the asset as well. Foreign-exchange risk applies to all financial instruments that are in a currency other than your domestic currency. As an example, if you are a resident of America and invest in some Canadian stock in Canadian dollars, even if the share value appreciates, you may lose money if the Canadian dollar depreciates in relation to the American dollar. </p>
<p>
<p><strong>Interest Rate Risk</strong> - Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment's value will change as a result of a change in interest rates. This risk affects the value of bonds more directly than stocks. (To learn more, read <em>How Interest Rates Affect The Stock Market</em>.) </p>
</li><li><strong>Political Risk</strong> - Political risk represents the financial risk that a country's government will suddenly change its policies. This is a major reason why developing countries lack foreign investment. </p>
<p></li><li><strong>Market Risk</strong> - This is the most familiar of all risks. Also referred to as volatility, market risk is the the day-to-day fluctuations in a stock's price. Market risk applies mainly to stocks and options. As a whole, stocks tend to perform well during a bull market and poorly during a bear market - volatility is not so much a cause but an effect of certain market forces. Volatility is a measure of risk because it refers to the behavior, or "temperament", of your investment rather than the reason for this behavior. Because market movement is the reason why people can make money from stocks, volatility is essential for returns, and the more unstable the investment the more chance there is that it will experience a dramatic change in either direction. </li></ul>As you can see, there are several types of risk that a smart investor should consider and pay careful attention to. </p>
<p>

<h2>Risk and Diversification: The Risk-Reward Tradeoff</h2>


<p>The risk-return tradeoff could easily be called the iron stomach test. Deciding what amount of risk you can take on is one of the most important investment decision you will make. </p>

<p>The risk-return tradeoff is the balance an investor must decide on between the desire for the lowest possible risk for the highest possible returns. Remember to keep in mind that low levels of uncertainty (low risk) are associated with low potential returns and high levels of uncertainty (high risk) are associated with high potential returns. </p>
<p>The risk-free rate of return is usually signified by the quoted yield of "U.S. Government Securities" because the government very rarely defaults on loans. Let's suppose that the risk-free rate is currently 6%. Therefore, for virtually no risk, an investor can earn 6% per year on his or her money. But who wants 6% when index funds are averaging 12-14.5% per year? Remember that index funds don't return 14.5% every year, instead they return -5% one year and 25% the next and so on. In other words, in order to receive this higher return, investors much also take on considerably more risk. </p>
<p>The following chart shows an example of the risk/return tradeoff for investing. A higher standard deviation means a higher risk: </p>

<p>In the next section, we'll show you what you can do to reduce the risk in your portfolio with an introduction to the diversification. </p>
<p>

<h2>Risk and Diversification: Diversifying Your Portfolio</h2>


<p>With the stock markets bouncing up and down 5% every week, individual investors clearly need a safety net. Diversification can work this way and can prevent your entire portfolio from losing value. </p>

<p>Diversifying your portfolio may not be the sexiest of investment topics. Still, most investment professionals agree that while it does not guarantee against a loss, diversification is the most important component to helping you reach your long-range financial goals while minimizing your risk. Keep in mind, however that no matter how much diversification you do, it can never reduce risk down to zero. (For related reading, see <em>Introduction To Diversification</em> and <em>The Importance Of Diversification</em>.) </p>
<p>What do you need to have a well diversified portfolio? There are three main things you should do to ensure that you are adequately diversified: </p>
<ol><li>Your portfolio should be spread among many different investment vehicles such as cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and perhaps even some real estate. </p>
<p></li><li>Your securities should vary in risk. You're not restricted to picking only blue chip stocks. In fact, the opposite is true. Picking different investments with different rates of return will ensure that large gains offset losses in other areas. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that you need to jump into high-risk investments such as penny stocks! </p>
<p></li><li>Your securities should vary by industry, minimizing unsystematic risk to small groups of companies. </p>
<p>Another question people always ask is how many stocks they should buy to reduce the risk of their portfolio. The portfolio theory tells us that after 10-12 diversified stocks, you are very close to optimal diversification. This doesn't mean buying 12 internet or tech stocks will give you optimal diversification. Instead, you need to buy stocks of different sizes and from various industries. </p>
