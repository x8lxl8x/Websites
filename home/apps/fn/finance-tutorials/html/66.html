<h1>Portfolio Turnover</h1>



<p>"Critics have long said that money managers who buy and sell frequently are confusing motion with progress." -Ian McDonald, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, August 12, 2005 </p>
<p>For investors, a mutual fund's transactional activity, or portfolio turnover, is one of the more easily explained investment qualities. Expressed as a percentage, it tells us what portion of the securities (stocks, bonds, or both) in a fund's portfolio are bought and sold during the course of a year. </p>
<p>This information is readily available from any number of sources, including the fund reports we are using, and tells us a great deal about a fund's operations besides the turnover of its holdings. As you will see in the following discussion, the simplicity of this particular piece of information belies its importance as a valuable measurement of a mutual fund's investment quality. </p>
<p>Just to be sure that the concept of mutual fund portfolio turnover is fully understood, let us look at an illustration of just what takes place. In our simplistic example, the XYZ Stock Fund is reported to have had a turnover rate in 2005 of 50% in a portfolio that held 100 stocks as of January 1, 2005. At year-end 2005, the portfolio still contained 100 stocks, but 50 of the original stocks were sold and replaced by 50 new stocks. If the turnover rate was 100%, all 100 of the original stocks would have been sold and 100 new stocks purchased. </p>

<p><strong>Portfolio Turnover and Investment Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the real world of mutual fund investment management, the buying and selling of securities by a fund's manager is part of the business. The issue that needs to be addressed is how this activity impacts the consideration of a fund's investment quality. </p>
<p>Before getting into the details of this discussion, the views of John Bogle, the founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group, on mutual fund operations are relevant. </p>
<p>Bogle believes that too many funds trade too much. In "Flying With The Fundamentals," which appeared in <em>Better Investing Magazine</em> in January 2006, Bogle is quoted as saying that when he got into finance in 1951, mutual fund turnover hardly varied from 16% per year, representing an average holding period of six years. However, Bogle noted that in more recent years, the average holding period has fallen to between 11 and 13 months, representing a 92% turnover rate. </p>
<p>The problem with increased turnover is that because the cost is coming out of the fund's assets and not the investment manager's fee, there seems to be little incentive for managers to change their ways. </p>


<p>Figure 1 provides some current comparative data on fund portfolio turnover rates. The managed funds category averages mask a wide range of trading activity from low single digit to medium triple digit turnover percentages. The index funds' listing includes individual funds selected from the Vanguard Group for each fund style category. The top-rated funds' turnover rates are for individual funds that have the best 10-year annualized total return from each category.</p>

</p>
<p>In Figure 1, portfolio turnover rates are expressed as a percentage. A low percentage figure equates to a longer portfolio holding period and vice versa. For example, 20% turnover means that a portfolio would be completely reconstituted after five years. A turnover of 100% means that a portfolio is completely reconstituted in one year. While most individuals are investing for the long term, it looks like the investment horizon for the average managed mutual fund is closer to one year. The characteristic low portfolio turnover rate of index investing is much in evidence. In all but two fund categories, the top-rated funds have portfolio turnover rates considerably below their respective managed-fund category averages. </p>

<h2>Fund I-Q No. 5: Portfolio Turnover Ratio</h2>



<p>Why should fund investors be concerned about portfolio turnover? There are four major reasons, and they all impact a fund's investment quality: </p>
<ol><li>There is an abundance of research that shows that buy-and-hold fund managers (low turnover) outperform their colleagues who trade frequently (high turnover). One of the reasons for this is that the former spend less on trading commissions than the latter. Trading costs are coming down, but they can still represent a significant fund expense. </p>
<p></li><li>These trading costs are not included in a fund's expense ratio. Thus, transaction costs are often ignored by investors because they are buried as a dollar figure, as opposed to a percentage of assets, in a fund's Statement of Additional Information (SAI). It is likely that only a tiny fraction of mutual fund investors are even aware of this document, let alone familiar with its content. (To learn more, read <em>Stop Paying High Fees</em>.)</p>
<p>According to 2005 Lipper Services data, trading commissions add, on average, an additional 0.15% to fund expenses. While the percentages may seem small, it can significantly ding returns over time. For example, consider two hypothetical $10,000 investments over 20 years in different funds with nontrading (operational) expenses of 1%, one with trading costs of 0.5% and the other with trading costs of 1%. Assuming annual growth of 8%, an investor would end up with just under $34,500 in the first fund and about $31,100 in the second. The $3,400 difference represents a significant 11% bonus in return for fund No.1 over fund No.2. </p>
<p></li><li>The components of an index fund change infrequently, which puts these types of funds in a low trading mode. However, unlike index funds, managed funds have human beings at the controls. And, the greater the number of trades, the more often the manager has to be making the right decision. A high volume of trading places a lot of pressure on managers to avoid making mistakes in investing judgments. (For related reading, see <em>The Lowdown On Index Funds</em>.)</p>
<p></li><li>A high level of fund trading activity generally occasions a higher-than-average amount of capital gains. Mutual funds must pay out these gains as dividends to fund shareholders, which are then subject to capital gains taxes. For investors in taxable funds, i.e., not in tax-deferred accounts, high portfolio-turnover funds are not tax efficient. </li></ol></p>
<p><strong>The Benefits Of Low Turnover</strong></p>
<p>A low portfolio turnover rate is a very positive fund investment quality. However, it must be remembered that the nature or investing style of a fund can impose certain "structural" features on portfolio management that influence its trading activities:</p>
<p><ul><li>Small-cap stock, international and growth funds tend to have higher turnover rates. These funds are more transaction-intensive as the managers maneuver for competitive advantages.     </li><li>Index funds should have low turnover rates, no matter what their category.    </li><li>Trading is a natural function of bond funds, which puts their turnover rates way up on the scale. (To learn more about this type of fund, see <em>Evaluating Bond Funds: Keeping It Simple</em>.)    </li><li>Funds that carry only a small number of securities in their portfolios oftentimes reflect high turnover rates because of the impact of a single trade on a major holding. </li></ul>Whatever the category of mutual fund being considered, the lower the portfolio turnover percentage the better. While this measurement may vary from year to year, a fund's trading activity is within the control of the manager and should consistently fall, historically, within a reasonable range. </p>

<h2>Scoring Fund Turnover Data</h2>


<p>The Morningstar and Value line mutual fund reports all present current and historical portfolio turnover figures. This is a useful piece of comparative data. (See sample Morningstar and Value Line reports.)</p>

<p>This is the entry we need to complete in the Fund Investment Quality Scorecard for an analysis of a mutual fund's portfolio turnover: </p>



<a href='../images/IQ5.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/IQ5.gif'></a>



<p><p>Targets for portfolio turnover in a managed stock fund would peg the current percent­age at or below 30% for a high evaluation and at or below 60% for an above-aver­age evaluation. In addition, the fund's turnover rate should be substantially below its peer group. The fund's current and historical portfolio turnover rates should be comparable, and if the former is lower, so much the better. If these investment qualities are evident, the fund should get a positive rating in this aspect of its operations. </p>
<p>Hopefully, you now have a better appreciation of what portfolio turnover is all about. This seemingly minor percentage figure tells us a lot about a fund manager's commitment to con­taining costs, which, if the job is well done, makes a fund more profitable and investor friendly. </p>
