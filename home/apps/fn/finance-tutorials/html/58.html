<h1>Guide To ETF Providers: Introduction</h1>

<p>Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are uniquely structured investment products that track indexes, or baskets of assets, including stocks, bonds, currencies, real estate and commodities. Because ETFs can cover a broad range of assets, they offer investors diversity from a single investment. When you purchase ETF shares, you are buying shares of a portfolio that tracks the yield and performance of its underlying asset(s). Like stocks, ETFs can be purchased on margin and sold short, and prices fluctuate throughout each trading session as shares are bought and sold on various exchanges. </p>
<p>On Jan. 22, 1993 20 ago, State Street Global Advisors introduced the first ETF - the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF</strong> (ARCA:SPY). SPY, which generally corresponds to the price and yield performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index, one of the most popular indexes in the world, launched with just $6.5 million in assets. Today, it has more than $123 billion in assets under management (AUM), representing about 6.4% of ETF assets worldwide. As both the oldest and largest ETF in the world, SPY opened up a new way for investors to gain access to the markets. Since SPY's historic introduction, the ETF industry has thrived and is now a trillion-dollar a year business, with thousands of ETFs available to match a wide variety of investment styles, objectives and risk tolerances. </p>
<p>There are now dozens of ETF providers - the firms that originate and, in many cases, manage ETFs. The providers offer various expense ratios, fund types, use of proprietary methodologies and fund structures. Certain providers specialize in specific areas of expertise. Direxion, for example, specializes in inverse and leveraged ETFs. EG Shares, on the other hand, concentrates on emerging market indexes. Other providers offer ETFs that cover every major asset class. Here we will introduce 12 of the providers that sell today's popular ETFs.</p>


<h2>Guide To ETF Providers: Direxion</h2>

<p>Direxion offers 44 U.S. listed ETFs distributed by Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC. Direxion specializes in leveraged ETFs - funds that use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. Founded in 1997, Direxion in 2008 became the first ETF provider to offer three times leveraged ("triple-leveraged") ETF products that seek returns that are 300% (or -300% for Bear Funds) of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. Triple-leveraged funds are identified with a "3X" in the fund name, such as "Direxion Financial Bull 3X Shares." Today, Direxion's quivers of leveraged ETFs offer exposure to a variety of markets, from emerging markets to specific sectors indexes and Treasuries. Leveraged ETFs are typically used by active traders seeking a short-term trading strategy. </p>
<p>Direxion also specializes in inverse ETFs - funds that are constructed by using a variety of derivatives with the intention of profiting from a decline in the value of the underlying benchmark. Because this is similar to holding various short positions, inverse ETFs are also called "short ETFs" and "Bear ETFs." Direxion's funds that seek to profit from declines are identified with "Bear" in the fund name; for example, "Direxion Small Cap Bear 3X Shares 2013 Russell 2000" (a fund which happens to be triple-leveraged as well as inverse). </p>
<p>Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Direxion ETFs have expense ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.95%, with an average of 0.89%. </p>

<h2>Guide To ETF Providers: EG Shares</h2>

<p>Emerging Global Shares, or EG Shares, ETFs track the performance of a variety of emerging markets indexes, including the Dow Jones Emerging Market Consumer Index, the Indxx Low Volatility Emerging Markets Dividend Index and the Dow Jones Emerging Markets Technology Titans Index. Emerging markets are economies that are exhibiting rapid growth and industrialization, including the BRIC nations: Brazil, Russia, India and China; and the MIST nations: Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey. Investing in emerging markets carries inherent risks because these markets are not fully developed. Risks, including lack of transparency, undeveloped regulatory systems, liquidity issues and volatility can affect the performance of investments. Many investors, however, find emerging markets attractive due to the potential for high returns since they frequently experience rapid economic growth as measured by GDP.</p>
<p>There are currently 22 EG Shares ETFs, with Emerging Global Advisors (EGA) acting as an advisor for the funds. Headquartered in New York City, NY, EGA is an asset management company that specializes in emerging markets exposure. The <strong>EG Shares Emerging Markets Energy Fund</strong> (ARCA:OGEM) and the <strong>EG Shares Emerging markets Metals &amp; Mining Fund</strong> (ARCA:EMT) were the first funds introduced by EGA in 2009. EG Shares funds have expense ratios ranging from 0.70 to 0.89%, with an average expense ratio of 0.84%.</p>
