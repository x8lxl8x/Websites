When an authorizer has been assigned to a particular function, all requests must be approved by the authorizer. You can assign two authorizers to a function: a primary and a secondary authorizer if your organization requires two levels of authorization.</p>
<p>Authorization setup is essentially a two-step process: first, a Security Officer specifies the number of required authorizers for specific Account Management functions (such as funding requests), then the Security Officer either designates existing account users as authorizers or adds new account users and designates them as authorizers.</p>

<h2>Automatic Billing</h2>
<p><b>For Advisors</b></p>
<p>A type of client fee schedule in which an IB-calculated fee is automatically billed to the client's account with blanket client authorization. Advisors can choose one of several methods of automatic billing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annualized Percentage of Net Liquidation Value</li>
<li>Annualized Flat Fee</li>
<li>Percent of Profit and Loss (P&amp;L)</li>
<li>Fee per trade unit
- Non-US advisors can set fee per trade client fees. Commodity-registered advisors in the US and US protectorates can set fee per trade client fees for futures only.</li>
<li>Monthly/Quarterly Invoicing - Advisors can submit electronic invoices for client fees. Invoices can be submitted for up to ten clients at a time, but only one invoice can be submitted per client account per day. Advisors can also upload a .csv file that contains multiple client invoices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advisors determine the fees at the time of the client’s registration and can modify them at any time. Advisor clients are required to acknowledge any fee increase with a signature.</p>
<p><b>For Brokers</b></p>
<p>Automatic billing is available for brokers but is different from advisor automatic billing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brokers use automatic billing for client fees when they want to submit electronic fee invoices for fully-disclosed client accounts.</li>
<li>Brokers specify a monthly or quarterly markup limit, then calculate the markup and submit an electronic invoice for each client account at any time, up to the specified limit. The invoice amount will be automatically transferred from the client account to the broker account. Brokers can submit invoices for up to ten clients at a time, but only one invoice per client account per day.</li>

<h2>Average Daily Trading Volume</h2>
<p>The average amount of individual securities traded in a single day or over a specified amount of time. Average Daily Trading Volume is equal to the number of shares traded over a specified time period divided by the number of trading sessions in that period.</p>
<p>Trading activity is related to a security's liquidity. When the average daily trading volume of a security is high, it can be easily traded and has high liquidity. Therefore, average daily trading volume can effect the price of the security. If trading volume low, the security will likely be less expensive because fewer people are willing to buy it.</p>

<h2>Base Currency</h2>
<p>An accounting term used to refer to the currency in which an investor maintains its book of accounts.</p>
<p> As part of an IB account, each client specifies a single base currency which determines the currency of translation for statements and the currency used for determining margin requirements. While the base currency selected will typically be the principal form of currency in which the client intends to hold cash and the denomination of instruments which the client  trades, clients are eligible to hold cash balances and trade instruments denominated in either a base or non-base currency.  If the client elects to maintain a cash or IRA account, then they are restricted to holding only long cash balances regardless of the currency of denomination.  Clients maintaining a margin account may change their base currency at any time in Account Management and may make deposits or withdrawals in a non-base currency.</p>
<p>Base Currencies are available in AUD, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, HUF, JPY, MXN, NOK, NZD, SEK, SGD or USD.  In addition, accounts opened via IB (India) Pvt. Ltd can only use INR as the base currency, and accounts opened via Interactive Brokers Securities Japan, Inc. can only use JPY as the base currency.</p>
<p>In addition, for foreign exchange market purposes, the term Base Currency refers to the first currency in a currency pair and the second, the Quote Currency. For example, for the USD.CAD cross pair, USD is considered the Base Currency and CAD the Quote Currency.  In Forex markets the USD is generally considered the base currency for quoting purposes, that is the quotes are expressed as a unit of USD $1 per the other currency quoted in the pair. The primary exceptions to this rule are the GBP, the EUR and the AUD.</p>

<h2>Continuous Net Settlement (CNS)</h2>
<p>CNS refers to the NSCC&rsquo;s automated book-entry accounting system, which centralizes the settlement of security transactions and maintains an orderly flow of security and money balances between participants. The CNS methodology serves to match transactions to securities available, resulting in one net receive or deliver position at the end of a given day.</p>
<p>How it Works</p>
<p>On T+3, all transactions for a given NSCC member are netted by issue to net long (buy) and net short (sell) positions, and then are further netted with positions that remained open after T+3 which includes positions due to settle that day as well as fail positions. If the net position is short (i.e. securities owed by the member to NSCC), the inventory in the member's DTC account is check for availability and if shares are available they are transferred from the member's DTC account to cover the short CNS obligation.&nbsp; Net long positions (i.e. securities owed by NSCC to the member), are automatically credited to the member's DTC account. A daily money settlement is debited or credited to the member's account based upon the value of all settled trades plus or minus the mark-to-market figures on any open CNS positions.</p>

<h2>Dividend</h2>
<p>There are two types of dividends a company can issue: cash and stock dividends. Typically only one or the other is issued at a specific period of time (either quarterly, bi-annually or yearly) but both may occur simultaneously. In the case of a cash dividend, a certain amount of money is distributed to each shareholder (e.g., in the case of cash dividend of $0.25 per share, the owner of 100 shares would receive $25 in total). As cash dividends are normally paid to stockholders out of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits their effect is to reduce the equity of the company once issued.</p>
<p>A stock dividend is a pro-rata distribution of additional shares of a company&rsquo;s stock to owners of the common stock. A stock dividend of 10%, for example, means that for every 10 shares owned, the shareholder receives an additional share. If the company has 1,000,000 shares outstanding (common stock), the stock dividend would increase the company's outstanding shares to a total of 1,100,000. The increase in shares outstanding, however, dilutes the earnings per share; therefore, all other things being equal, the stock price should decrease.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong></p>
<p>If you borrow stock to effect a short sale, you are obligated to remit to the lender payments in lieu of the dividends distributed while you maintain your short position.</p>

<h2>High Water Mark</h2>
<p>A client fee option for advisors who select Automatic Billing &gt; Percent of P&amp;L as the basis of their client fees used to offset periods of losses in a volatile market. Advisors cannot charge a profit-based fee as long as a cumulative loss exists.</p>
<p>High Water Marking lets an advisor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify a look-back period (in quarters or years, based on the period selection in the Percent of P&amp;L fee schedule).</li>
<li>High Water Marking keeps track of cumulative losses per billing period within the specified look-back period. A loss in any period will be added to the look-back period's cumulative losses. A gain in any period will decrease the cumulative loss recorded to date. By default, the look-back period is zero, which means that High Water Marking will NOT be in effect.</li>
<li>Prorate for withdrawals. If an advisor chooses to prorate, withdrawals in the current period reduce any cumulative losses that are carried over from previous periods. The losses are reduced in proportion to the percentage of equity that was withdrawn.</li>
<li>Note that current period losses are never adjusted by current period withdrawals, gains are not prorated and deposits are not used to prorate losses.</li>
<li>Optionally initialize High Water Marking with previous periods' losses by entering the amount of the losses. These losses may have been incurred for the client in another account or with another broker. Gains are applied to the oldest losses first.</li>
</ul>
<p>High Water Marking is effective on the day we process the approved client agreement.</p>

<h2>Joint Account</h2>
<p>An Interactive Brokers account owned by two individuals. A Joint Account can be associated with one of three customer types:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship</b> - A form of ownership in which two or more parties have equal interests in the account and in which title to the entire account goes to the survivor(s) upon the death of one of the account holders. This process avoids court probate of the property, but may have some tax consequences which should be reviewed with a tax advisor prior to opening the account.</li>
<li><b>Community Property</b> - Community Property is property received by a husband and wife during the marriage, except inheritances and specific gifts to one of the spouses. This form of ownership is recognized only in certain states which have community property laws and each spouse has an undivided one-half interest in the account. The states with community property laws at this time are: Louisiana, Arizona, California, Texas, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin. Upon the death of one spouse, the community property in the account generally passes to the other spouse with certain exceptions, including Texas, Nevada and New Mexico.</li>
<li><b>Tenants in Common</b> - A form of ownership by two or more persons in which each person has an undivided interest in the account even though the percentage of interests may not be equal. Unlike joint tenants, there is no right of survivorship if one of the account holders ides. Upon the death of one tenant in common, a probate proceeding (court-supervised administration of the estate of the deceased) must be held to transfer the ownership interest in the account. This type of joint account requires that you enter ownership percentages in the account application.</li>

<h2>Mergers and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>A merger occurs when two or more companies combine into one while all parties involved mutually agree to the terms of the merger. Mergers are commonly voluntary and involve stock swap or cash payment to the target. A stock swap is often used as it allows the shareholders of the two companies to share the risk involved in the deal.</p>
<p>A reverse merger occurs when a private company that has strong prospects and is eager to raise public financing buys a publicly listed shell company, usually one with no business and limited assets.</p>
<p>An acquisition, also known as a takeover or a buyout, is the buying of one company (the &lsquo;target&rsquo;) by another. This is accomplished either through the purchase of shares, and therefore control, of the target company or through the purchase of the assets of the target company. In this instance, the cash the target receives from the sell-off is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through liquidation. Acquisitions can often be friendly but may also be hostile, meaning that the acquired company does not find it favorable that a majority of its shares was bought by another entity.</p>
<p>A merger or acquisition may dictate a mandatory action or offer voluntary participation to the shareholder, oftentimes with multiple options.&nbsp;The entire event process can take months and will typically involve position changes, settlement, and distribution.</p>

<h2>Share Repurchase</h2>
<p>A program by which a company buys back its own shares from the marketplace, thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares. &nbsp;Often chosen when management believes shares are undervalued or as a defense against unwanted takeovers. In many cases a share repurchase will increase the share price of the remaining outstanding shares as a result of a higher earnings per share. In this case, this type of distribution effectively distributes cash to shareholders in the form of capital gains rather than dividends.</p>
<p>Share repurchases may be accomplished via a tender offer, open-market repurchase or targeted share repurchase.&nbsp;A tender offer may be fixed price (company specifies the maximum number of shares it will purchase, the fixed price at which it will buy the shares, and the offer expiration date) or Dutch Auction (company specifies a range of prices at which it is willing to purchase shares and shareholders decide the price within the range they&rsquo;ll accept, with the actual purchase price for all shares determined as the minimum price sufficient to buy the specified number of shares).&nbsp;In an open market repurchase, the firm seeks to anonymously buy shares periodically in the secondary market.&nbsp;In a targeted share repurchase, the company seeks to buy back the shares of a particular shareholder or group of shareholders.</p>

<h2>Short Sale &gt; Buy-In</h2>
<p>A buy-in occurs when the borrowed shares required to support a short sale are not available or are recalled by the lender, and no shares can be found for borrowing. The short seller is then required to buy the shares at the prevailing price, which may negate the potential profits of the short sale strategy of selling high and buying low at a later date.</p>

<h2>Short Sale &gt; Collateral</h2>
<p>Borrowing stock requires that the borrow post collateral of the quantity x underlying share price to the lender in exchange for the shares. Collateral is returned to the borrower when the shares are returned to the lender. The lender is required to pay any applicable interest on the collateral to the borrower.</p>

<p>In determining the cash deposit required to collateralize a stock borrow position, the general industry convention is for the lender to require a deposit equal to 102% of the prior day's settlement price, rounded up to the nearest whole dollar and then multiplied by the number of shares borrowed.  As borrow rates are determined based on the value of the loan collateral, this convention impacts the cost of maintaining the short position, with the impact being most significant in the case of low-priced and hard-to-borrow shares. Account holders may view this adjusted price for a given transaction in the "Non-Direct Hard to Borrow Details"  section of the daily account statement.</p>

<h2>Stock</h2>
<p>A security that represents ownership in a corporation and a claim on part of the corporation's earnings and assets. There are generally two types of stock: common and preferred.

<h2>Stock Option</h2>
<p>The right but not the obligation to buy (a <a href='#name.194'>call</a> option) or sell (a <a href="681">put</a> option) a specific amount of a given stock, commodity, currency, index, or debt, at a specified price (the strike price) during a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Each option has a buyer (the holder) and a seller (the writer). When an option contract is exercised, the writer is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the contract by delivering the shares to the appropriate party. If a security cannot be delivered, for example an index, the contract is settled in cash.</p>
<p>When an option is not exercised, it expires. No shares change hands and the money spent to purchase the option is lost.</p>
<p>Options are often used as either leverage or protection. As leverage, options allow the holder to control equity in a limited capacity for a fraction of what the shares would normally cost. The difference can be invested elsewhere until the option is exercised. As protection, options can guard against price fluctuations in the near term because they provide the right to buy the underlying stock at a fixed price for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Stock Split</h2>
<p>A type of corporate action that increases a company's number of outstanding shares by dividing each share, which in turn diminishes its price. In the case of a 2-for-1 (2:1) stock split, for example, the company will distribute an additional share for every one outstanding share, so the total shares outstanding will double&nbsp;A split can also be referred to in percentage terms. Thus, a 2 for 1 (2:1) split can also be termed a stock split of 100%. A 3 for 2 split (3:2) would be a 50% split.</p>
<p>A stock split, alone, has no impact upon the net assets or market capitalization of the company.&nbsp;It is generally intended to increase the liquidity of the share on the market along with the perception that the shares are more affordable.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a reverse split might be implemented by a company that would like to increase the price of its shares. If a $1 stock had a reverse split of 1 for 10 (1:10), holders would have to trade in 10 of their old shares for one new one, but the stock would increase from $1 to $10 per share (again retaining the same market capitalization). A company may decide to use a reverse split in order to prevent the company from being de-listed as many stock exchanges will de-list stocks if they fall below a certain price per share.</p>

<p>A statistical measure of the distribution of returns for a specific security or market index. Volatility can be measured by using the standard deviation or by the variance between returns from the same security or market index. Typically, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.</p>
<p>A high volatility indicates that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values, meaning that the price of the security may fluctuate dramatically over a short period of time in either direction. A low volatility indicates that a security's value does not change dramatically, but changes in value steadily over a period of time.</p>

<h2>VWAP Guaranteed</h2>
<p>IB supports guaranteed VWAPs (Volume-Weighted Average Price) for large cap stocks. The VWAP for a stock is calculated by adding the dollars traded for every transaction in that stock ("price" x "number of shares traded") and dividing the total shares traded. By default, a VWAP order is computed from the open of the market to the market close, and is calculated by volume weighting all transactions during this time period. TWS allows you to modify the cut-off and expiration times using the Time in Force and Expiration Date fields, respectively.</p>

<h2>Wash Sales</h2>
<p>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service defines a wash sale as &quot;a sale of stock or securities at a loss within 30 days before or after you buy or acquire in a fully taxable trade, or acquire a contract or option to buy, substantially identical stock or securities.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wash sale period consists of 61 calendar days:&nbsp; 30 days before the sale and 30 days after the sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquiring the security during this period may disallow an investor from deducting any of the transaction's loss.</p>
<p>The wash sale IRS&nbsp;guidelines are designed to prevent investors from artificially generating losses where they do not actually intend to reduce their holdings in the assets sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

(trading symbol AAPL) which has the following ISIN: US0378331005.&nbsp; The first two characters (US) represent the country in which this issuer is domiciled.&nbsp; The next nine (037833100) represent the NSIN which, as this is a US issuer, is a CUSIP.&nbsp; The final character (5) is the check digit used for error detection.</p>
