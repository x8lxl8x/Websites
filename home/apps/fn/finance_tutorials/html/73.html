<h1>Guide To Measuring Oil And Gas Companies - Introduction</h1>







The oil and gas industry is one of the more difficult sectors to understand. There are several reasons for this, but the largest hurdle is time. Oil and gas names are valued differently, and they also have a different vernacular. These terms are unique to this industry, and have meanings that are difficult to conceptualize. Understanding is difficult without oil and gas experience. There are so many statistics involved that it takes considerable time following just a few companies. This information could require several operators' in a specific area comparing several variables, and it's very important to compare like companies with like results.  </p>

<p>

<h2>Guide To Measuring Oil And Gas Companies - Statistics</h2>

<p>An oil and gas company operating in the Bakken cannot be compared to a producer in the Marcellus. Not only will the production results differ, but so will costs and the type of resource. These variables can be significant, and in many ways more important than financial ratios. Initial production improvements lead to higher estimated ultimate recoveries, which will push a stock higher. We are in the beginning of horizontal production within the United States. Given the large improvements over the past decade, we could see the value of these companies continue to climb higher. There are a large number of statistics used in valuing production in oil and gas in the U.S. Here are most of those statistics:</p>
<p>SEE: Oil And Gas Industry Primer</p>
<p><strong>Well Costs</strong></p>
<p>Can include everything from drilling to completing. The largest expense is water, which includes fresh water needed to complete to the well and flow back that needs to be hauled off and disposed of. This number varies significantly from one site to the next. <strong>Kodiak</strong> (NYSE:KOG) currently estimates its well costs to have a midpoint of $10.5 million for a long lateral. <strong>Whiting</strong> (NYSE:WLL) estimates this number to be between $6 million and $7 million. </p>
<p><strong>West Texas Intermediate Pricing</strong></p>
<p>The price of oil drives the companies, and WTI is the standard for oil pricing in the U.S. Regional types of oil can differ in pricing and have a differential or price adjustment depending on a deliverable price to location. Bakken Light crude currently sells at a discount to WTI, while Light Louisiana Sweet crude sells at a premium. </p>
<p><strong>NPV</strong></p>
<p>The net present value compares the value of a dollar now versus its value in the future with inflation and returns. This can be used to show the value of a well.</p>
<p>SEE: Understanding Net Present Value Video<strong></p>
<p>IRR</strong></p>
<p>The internal rate of return gives the present value of future cash flow from an investment equal to that investment. </p>
<p><strong>Payout</strong></p>
<p>This represents the amount of time it will take to recoup an initial cost of an oil well. This is generally expressed in months. </p>
<p><strong>Lateral Length</strong></p>
<p>The total length of the lateral leg of a well. As a general rule, a short lateral can run from 4,000 to 5,000 feet. A long lateral is 9,000 to 10,000 feet. Wells can have multilaterals as it decreases costs and saves time in drilling and completing. </p>

<p><strong>Stages</strong></p>
<p>The lateral leg of a horizontal well will undergo hydraulic "fracking" after drilling is finished and completion services have begun. When a well is, pressure pumping equipment is used to pump water, fractured fluids and into the well for the purpose of fracturing the shale, which allows the resource to be released. This is done in stages to better isolate the shale over a shorter distance and get better fracturing to retrieve more resources. In general, the larger the number of stages used the better the initial production numbers will be. </p>
<p><strong>Initial Production Rate</strong></p>
<p>This is the average amount of oil and/or gas produced over a specific time frame from a well. The IP rate generally refers to the first 24 hours of the well, while the 90-day IP rate relates to the first 90 days. </p>
<p><strong>Estimated Ultimate Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Generally referred to as the EUR, it shows the approximate total recovery of the well. IP rates can be used to make an educated guess at the total resource garnered over the life of a well. IP rates can be for oil only, natural gas only or a combination of both.</p>
<p><strong>Choke Size</strong></p>
<p>Chokes are generally used in high flow rate wells. The reduced diameters when compared to the tubing which creates a pressure drop. Flow rates decrease when a pressure drop is introduced to a well. Choke size is shown as a fraction with the denominator based on 64, and in inches. Therefore the larger the numerator is the larger the choke in inches. </p>
<p><strong>Wellhead Pressure (PSI)</strong></p>
<p>In unconventional resource, this pressure can give an idea of how well the well will produce before being placed on a pump. This pressure has been found to be higher in wells with a higher gas to oil ratio. As liquids move to the wellhead, the gas helps to push these liquids out. This number can change depending on the choke used, and can significantly affect IP rates and. <strong></strong></p>
<p>SEE: Investing In Oil And Gas UITs<strong></p>
<p>Water Volumes</strong></p>
<p>The volume of water used to frac a well can significantly affect the amount of resource garnered from a well. The more water used and increased pressures can better frac shale. This tends to open larger and deeper fractures.</p>
<p><strong>Proppant Volumes</strong></p>
<p>Proppant can vary significantly from one producer to the next, when gauging amounts and type. Sand, ceramic sand and ceramic proppant are all used during completions. It is thought ceramic proppant or beads "prop" fractures open the best, but in some cases can be cost prohibitive. </p>
<p>It is important to understand the basics in horizontal drilling applications. Initial drilling is vertical like conventional methods. This vertical leg is angled using directional drilling techniques until it runs horizontally. The horizontal leg is referred to as a lateral. A short lateral is approximately one mile or 5000 feet long. A long lateral is twice that length. The lateral is then perforated and the shale fracked. Frac fluids are pumped into the well, which cause breaks or fracturing of the shale. </p>
<p>A combination of sand and proppant are pushed into those fracs, effectively propping it open. The better these fractures are propped open the more oil will flow from the shale. Due to the length of the lateral, these fracs are done in stages. The lateral length can be divided by the number of stages, and the more stages used, the shorter each will be. The shorter the stage is the better the stimulation. </p>


<h2>Guide To Measuring Oil And Gas Companies - Location</h2>

<p>The next variable to consider is location. Each play is unique in production and reserves. These plays also differ in types of production, and we can see this difference as location within the play is changed. If one was to be specific, breaking down each play by county would be prudent. Do not make the mistake of thinking the basin and formation are the same thing. The basin is a geological depression, which consists of rock that slopes down to a common center. A formation is a layer of rock that has like characteristics. Here are two of the best producing formations located in America's basins. </p>
<p><strong><u>Williston Basin/Bakken and Three Forks Formations</u></strong></p>
<p>Although this area is known for the middle Bakken formation, there may be more upside to the Three Forks. In some areas the Three Forks has up to four benches/layers. Well spacing is important as the middle Bakken generally supports four wells, but has seen up to six. The upper Three Forks has seen the same number. </p>
<p><strong>Continental </strong>(NYSE:CLR) and <strong>Conocophillips </strong>(NYSE:COP) have both had successful wells in the second bench. These additional benches could significantly increase recoverable reserves. This area is known for its very high percentage of liquids production. <strong>EOG Resources </strong>(NYSE:EOG) reports liquids production as high as 98% in Mountrail County. This production is 92% oil/6% natural gas liquids/2% natural gas. This production changes to 78% oil/11% natural gas liquids/11% natural gas in northeast McKenzie County. Liquids increase to 94% in western Williams County with a resource breakdown of 87% oil/7% natural gas liquids/6% natural gas. </p>
<p>The middle Bakken reaches thickness of 90 feet in western Mountrail County, while the Three Forks reaches a total thickness of 270 feet in areas. Well costs for long lateral ranges from Continental's $7 million to <strong>Newfield's </strong>(NYSE:NFX) $11 million. Horizontal techniques differ greatly as EOG Resources completes short laterals that average approximately 4000 to 5000 feet in length. It uses 15 frac stages, and a 12/64 choke. The best well concerning initial production in the Williston Basin is Whiting's Tarpon Federal 21-4H. It has an IP rate of 4815 barrels of oil and 13163 Mcf of natural gas. It had a 90-day IP rate of 1260 barrels of oil.<strong></strong></p>

<p><u>Western Gulf Basin/Eagle Ford</u> </strong></p>
<p>This area is known for the Eagle Ford, and should be as it may be the best unconventional play in the U.S. This play, like the Utica, has three windows. The northwest area of this formation is the oil window. From northwest to southeast, the play also has a condensate window followed by gas window. EOG Resources has stated the oil window is 88% liquids with 78% being oil.   </p>
<p><strong>SM Energy </strong>(NYSE:SM) has reported the condensate window in northern Webb County is 25% oil, 33% natural gas liquids and 42% natural gas. The gas window is mostly natural gas, with the southeastern portion 100% gas. The Eagle Ford is about 6000 feet below the surface in the oil window which gets progressively deeper to the southeast. It is found at approximately 12,000 feet in the gas window. This makes the gas window even less economic as well costs increase significantly. </p>

<p>Well spacing is very tight between 90 and 65 acres. The Eagle Ford reaches a max thickness of 300 feet. There have been consistent, very good well results in southeast Gonzales County. The geology shows this area to have some of the thickest shale in the Basin. Recently, EOG Resources has reported short laterals with IP rates of 3000+ Bo/d plus natural gas and natural gas liquids. For the entire Eagle Ford, it has EURs of 450,000 BOE. </p>
<p><strong>Magnum Hunter </strong>(NYSE:MHR) is also in Gonzales County. EOG's results have been better, but Magnum has still produced lucrative completions. Initially, it used 13 to 16 stages, but this range has increased from 20 to 25. It has had three IP rates above 2000 Boe/d, with a high of 2289 Boe/d. Magnum has had four 30-day IP rates above 900 Boe/d, with a high of 1203 Boe/d. In one year, production will decrease to approximately 170 Boe/d. Magnum has Eagle Ford well costs at $9 million, EURs of 433 MBoe, and an average IP rate of 1250 Boe/d. Using these statistics, it will have IRR's of 38% at $85 oil and 97% at $115. Strip prices as of 4/9/12 produce IRRs of 54% in the liquids rich Eagle Ford, which is America's best unconventional play. Wattenberg Field in the Niobrara is second with 53%, and Mississippian Lime is third at 51%. There is a significant drop in plays following as the fourth best is Green River in the Uinta at 39%. <strong>Penn Virginia </strong>(NYSE:PVA) has well costs of $7.5 million in Gonzales County. It has EURs of 400+ MBoe, and production of 94% liquids with oil comprising of 88%. A well with an IP rate of 1000 Boe/d and 30-day IP rate of 775 Boe/d, will produce a BTAX PV-10 of $5 million. This assumes $85 oil and well costs of $7 million. Penn Virginia's BTAX PV-10 breakeven point is between $50 and $57/barrel of oil. </p>
<p><strong>Marathon </strong>(NYSE:MRO) breaks down the Eagle Ford into four windows. The oil window is broken into two separate areas. To the northwest is the low GOR oil window, which produces an average 30-day IP rate of 385 Boe/d. This is 95% liquids and it has EURs of 445 MBoe. Using $85 oil, the low GOR window will have an average BFIT IRR of 22%. The next area to the southeast is the high GOR oil window. Its average 30-day IP rate is 675 Boe/d and EURs are 645 Boe/d. This window derives 77% of its production from liquids. Marathon's BFIT IRR is 43 to 50%. The condensate window has an average 30-day IP rate of 1650 Boe/d. EURs average 965 MBoe. Wells in this window produce 72% liquids. BFIT IRRs are over 100% in the condensate window. Last is the gas window which is not being pursued due to low gas pricing. For all four windows a 5000 foot lateral was used with well costs of $7.9 million.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>In summary, there are a large number of statistics important in identifying the value of oil and gas acreage. These are not difficult to calculate, but can differ a great deal from one play to the next. It is imperative to study the oil and gas producers in the area to get a feel of companies that are performing and not performing. The length of laterals and number of stages are just two variables that can affect initial production rates. When this is coupled with the amount of water and type of proppant, only an investor skilled in that particular play is going to understand why it had a good or bad result. </p>
