<h1>Finding Mutual Fund Data</h1>




<p>When it comes to mutual fund data, there is a huge information overload. But do not despair. To effectively determine the investment quality of a mutual fund, you are only going to have to deal with eight items and we'll show you how to do this in a simple, yet effective, manner.</p>
<p>The first step in this process is to provide you with the "maps" that you can use to find the evaluative data you need to complete a Fund Investment Quality Scorecard. Among the various sources of mutual fund data, the fund reports provided by Morningstarand Value Line are of the greatest practical value. These independent investment research firms are universally respected for the quality and objectivity of their reporting. And, most importantly, for the vast majority of individual investors, these firms' mutual fund reports rank at the top of the list in terms of their affordability and general accessibility. </p>
<p>Using a technique akin to the paint-by-the-numbers approach used by beginning artists, the information points you need to focus on in these reports are keyed to the eight investment qualities that are evaluated in a Fund IQ Scorecard. </p>

<h2>Morningstar Fund Report</h2>

<p>Based in Chicago, Morningstar Inc. has a 20-year history as a reliable provider of one of the most comprehensive one-page mutual fund reports presently available. The company has expanded into several other fields of investment information but is still best-known for its analytical coverage of mutual funds. (Check out a sample <em>Morningstar Fund Report</em>.)</p>
<p>In terms of one-stop shopping for fund evaluative data, the Morningstar fund report essentially covers all the bases. By focusing on just eight of the some 100 information points in a report, you can find all the data you need to complete the Fund IQ Scorecard. </p>
<p>While the Value Line fund reports are competitive in terms of content, Morningstar's "accessibility factor" ranks it number one for many investors. Most public libraries in the U.S. have a print and/or an online subscription to <em>Morningstar Mutual Funds</em>, which provides fund reports on more than 2,000 funds. Library patrons, therefore, can tap into this resource free of charge. If you want to have direct access to Morningstar fund reports, you can do so through an online premier membership, which is available for a nominal yearly fee.

<h2>Value Line Fund Report</h2>




<p>In terms of accessibility, the <em>Value Line Mutual Fund Survey</em> fund reports are not as easy to obtain as the reports from Morningstar. These reports are also substantially more expensive. However, if you have, or aspire to have, a mutual fund portfolio in the $75,000 to $100,000 range, the Value Line fund reports are worthwhile. Their analytical commentary feature is not as strong as Morningstar's, but their "Past Market Cycle Performance" and "Portfolio Manager Rating" are unique, valuable report components. </p>
<p>The <em>Value Line Fund Survey</em> can be subscribed to either in print or electronically. (Check out a sample <em>Value Line Survey</em>.) </p>

<h2>Retirement Plan Documentation and Other Sources</h2>




<p>Mutual fund companies and retirement plan providers generate a huge amount of fund literature. While marginally useful, this material cannot come close to providing individual investors with what they need to know when it comes to making a buy, sell or hold decision on a mutual fund. (For more insight, see <em>When To Sell A Mutual Fund</em>.)</p>
<p>The material provided by the fund companies (prospectus, annual, semiannual and quarterly reports, and the statement of additional information) is obligatory disclosure information. However, even investment professionals feel that a great deal of this documentation is mostly unintelligible. The glossy brochures and fund profiles produced by retirement plan providers usually get an "A" for the graphics but are short on substantive, insightful content. In fact, many of them have a certain boilerplate quality about them. </p>
<p>According to David Swenson's book, "Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach To Personal Investment" (2005), a typical mutual fund has volumes of reading material. Figure 1, below, shows the number of pages from five typical mutual funds. </p>

</p>
<p>These items total a mere 852 pages for five mutual funds! Compared to five one-page fund reports available from the investment research firms mentioned above, the alternative choice is an easy one.</p>
<p>To find investment quality in a mutual fund, non-professional investors need the analytical perspectives provided by Morningstar and Value Line. These reports, and their targeted evaluative data (which is used in a Fund Investment Quality Scorecard), enable an individual investor to make smart mutual fund choices. </p>
<p><strong><strong></p>
<p>
</strong>Informational Websites</strong></p>
<p>Without doubt, a fund report is the most efficient and effective way to research a mutual fund's investment quality. However, there are also a number of good general investment information websites that can help investors improve their overall mutual fund investing skills. </p>
<p>The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) publishes its <em>Guide to the Top Investment Web Sites</em> annually in its September issue of the <em>AAII Journal</em>. Its picks for top sites for mutual fund data in 2007 included the following free - either totally or partially - sites: </p>
<p><ul><li>Morningstar    </li><li>MSN Money     </li><li>SmartMoney     </li><li>Yahoo!Finance    </li><li>Zacks.com </p>
