<h1>Safety and Income: Introduction</h1>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons why an individual might wish to save and invest. The first reason is to protect their hard-earned money and ensure its safety. The second reason is to generate current income with which to meet expenses and the third is a desire to grow their principal and achieve capital gains. This tutorial will examine investment strategies designed to meet those first two goals: safety and income.</p>

<p>The tutorial will begin with a discussion of why an investor might wish to focus upon safety and income, followed by important caveats regarding this investment approach. The tutorial will then move on to examine various asset classes that might be able to meet the investment goals of principal safety and income generation. The asset classes discussed will include dividend paying stocks, bonds, various bank products, guaranteed income products, and real assets such as gold or real estate. Following this discussion of available asset classes, the tutorial will conclude with an examination of the role of safety and income within the larger portfolio management process.</p>
<p>Having read this tutorial, individuals will have a better understanding of the importance of principal safety and income generation in their overall investment program. Readers will also better understand asset classes that are available to them and how they can be used to structure a diversified portfolio. While a focus upon safety and income is not appropriate for all investors, many can benefit from such an approach and even individuals primarily focused upon capital appreciation may find that incorporating the principles discussed in this tutorial will enhance their overall investment program.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Why Focus on Safety and Income?</h2>

<p>When constructing a portfolio, an investor must choose which investment objectives to focus upon. Possible objectives include: principal appreciation, income generation and principal preservation. </p>


<p>Of course, in a perfect world, every investor would prefer to see his or her principal amount grow while still generating substantial current income. Furthermore, investors would like for this to occur with little risk of principal loss. Unfortunately, in the financial markets, accomplishing this magical trifecta is often difficult if not impossible. Therefore, investors must choose which priorities they will focus on when building their portfolios. This is a personal choice based on individual circumstances, objectives, risk tolerance and constraints. However, some general guidance can be given.</p>
<p><strong>Finding a Focus</p>
<p></strong>An investor would find it difficult or impossible to rebuild the principal that they have saved should focus on preservation of capital. Similarly, if the investor knows that they will need the money at a defined point in the future, they should carefully monitor the amount of risk they take. In these instances, a focus upon safety is probably appropriate. (For more, check out <em>What Is Your Risk Tolerance?</em>)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if an investor depends upon cash flow from their portfolio to meet part or all of their current expenses, the focus of the investment program should probably be upon income generation. Finally, if an investor is focused upon longer-term goals which will require a significant sum of money, capital appreciation should probably be their focus.</p>
<p>Although it may be impossible to build a portfolio with no risk of capital loss, high levels of current income, and exceptional growth potential, the three investment goals need not be mutually exclusive, and it is possible to construct a portfolio that is relatively safe while still offering the potential for some capital appreciation. Such a portfolio can also be structured to generate the current income necessary to meet expenses. There are limits to this approach though. For instance, aggressive growth mandates are generally not congruent with safety of principal or income generation. These limits force an investor to choose what their primary investment goals will be.</p>
<p>
<strong>Importance of Safety</p>
<p></strong>Once an investor has experienced a substantial loss, it becomes increasingly difficult to meet their financial goals. A simple example will provide evidence as to why it is important for investors to protect their principal. If a portfolio loses 50% of its principal, an investor must then generate gains of 100% just to reach the breakeven point. Given long-term averages for various investment classes, 100% gains can take years or even decades to achieve. This does not mean that investors should avoid taking any losses at all. All investments contain some risk; the key to success is to identify an appropriate risk tolerance and then manage the portfolio to that tolerance. In some instances, this may mean that the avoidance of any losses is appropriate, but in others moderate capital losses may be tolerable if the portfolio is properly designed to meet its long-term return objectives. (To learn more, read <em>Protect Yourself from Market Loss</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Income</p>
<p></strong>Many investors depend on income from their portfolio in order to meet current expenses. This is true not only for individuals, but also for institutional investors such as endowments or pension funds. Furthermore, income provides an important component of the total return of a portfolio. Therefore, even investors focused on capital appreciation should be aware of the importance of income in their portfolios.</p>
<p>In a diversified portfolio, the performance of the fixed income portion will be dominated by the income component. While equities are likely to benefit from some capital appreciation over time, even in the stock market income has been responsible for a substantial portion of total returns over time. Therefore, investors that ignore the effect of income on their portfolio performance generally do so to their own detriment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</p>
<p></strong>Almost no one likes the idea of seeing their hard earned dollars disappear as a result of losses in their investment portfolio. Safety of principal is even more important for investors who are unable to easily replenish their funds. While younger workers have time to make up investment losses, older workers or retirees may find they are unable to do so. That is the main reason why many financial planners recommend that investors gradually shift to a more conservative approach as they grow older. However, regardless of an investor's age, large investment losses are difficult to overcome, which makes risk management and diversification important for all investors.</p>
<p>Income has provided a substantial portion of total portfolio returns over time, making it vital that investors consider this important aspect of investment returns as they structure their portfolios. The more reliant an investor is on cash flow, the more important this consideration is.</p>
<p>All investors should pay close attention to the safety and income components of their portfolio. For older workers, retirees, and individuals dependent upon their portfolios' cash flows, a focus on safety and income is imperative.

<h2>Safety and Income: Caveats Regarding Safety and Income</h2>

<p>While focusing upon safety and income is appropriate for many individuals, it is important to realize that there are some drawbacks to this approach. These shortcomings also mean that this investment approach is not appropriate for all investors. In this chapter, we will examine some of the important caveats regarding an investment approach focused on safety and income and also briefly discuss the types of investors that may be better off managing their portfolio for capital appreciation.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Inflation</p>
<p>Inflation is the enemy of all savers and investors. Quietly, year after year, inflation eats away at the real value of dollars saved and invested. In fact, one of the primary reasons for investing is so that money saved today can retain its value into the future. By achieving capital appreciation, a portfolio can keep pace with or perhaps even exceed the rate of inflation, thereby increasing an investor's real purchasing power. However, an investment approach focused solely on principal safety may not be able to keep pace with inflation. (For a background on this topic, see our <em>Inflation Tutorial</em>.)</p>
<p>This is important to consider, because some investors may feel that their money is safe simply because their principal is not at risk of loss. However, if the total return on the investment portfolio is below the long-term rate of inflation, the investor is "losing" money even if they do not realize it. That is because their purchasing power is gradually declining even as their principal balance remains stable.</p>
<p>Investors interested in income must also be aware of the effects of inflation. In order to preserve purchasing power, the amount of income generated by the portfolio must increase over time. If it does not, future income will have less value in "real terms," resulting in a decline in purchasing power and standard of living.</p>
<p>Inflation is one of the main reasons why even investors focused upon safety and income should not ignore portfolio growth. By achieving some capital appreciation in the portfolio, an investor can help to protect themselves against the long-term effects of inflation. (To learn more, read <em>Shield Your Portfolio From Inflation For Real Returns</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>Taxes</p>
<p></strong>Taxes are an important consideration for most investors. However, tax considerations become even more important when an investor focuses upon generating income. That is because many individuals will find that income is taxed at a higher rate than capital gains.</p>
<p>Tax avoidance strategies are heavily dependent on an individual's unique circumstances, and should be devised in consultation with an accountant or financial advisor. However, one simple step that some investors can take is to hold income-generating assets in tax-sheltered accounts (such as retirement accounts) while holding non-income-generating assets in fully taxable accounts. Such an approach would help to minimize current taxes on income generated from the overall investment portfolio. However, this approach would not work if the investor needs portfolio income to meet current cash flow needs. In these circumstances, an investor will have no choice but to receive the income and pay taxes on it. (For more, be sure to read <em>A Long-Term Mindset Meets Dreaded Capital-Gains Tax</em>.)</p>
<p>
Because this is not a tutorial on taxation issues, it is enough for most readers to understand that in many cases income and capital gains will be taxed differently. Beyond that, it is highly recommended that individuals interested in better understanding how taxes will affect their total investment performance consult an appropriate expert.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing on Growth</p>
<p></strong>While focusing upon safety and income is an attractive approach for many individuals, it is not appropriate for everyone. In particular, investors with long-term goals may want to consider focusing more closely upon capital appreciation in their portfolios. There are two reasons why a long-term time horizon makes capital appreciation more important. The first is that over longer periods of time, inflation begins to have a greater impact on a portfolio's real value. This means that principal appreciation becomes increasingly necessary simply to keep pace with the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Secondly, safety can have different meanings when analyzed over different time periods. For example, when investing to meet short-term objectives, safety might be viewed as the amount of principal fluctuation on a quarterly or yearly basis. In these instances, the overriding concern is to avoid a decline in portfolio value that would prevent the financial goal from being met. However, as an investor's time horizon stretches into decades, these quarterly or annual principal fluctuations become less important. Instead, the investor's main risk becomes the portfolio's ability (or inability) to grow to a sufficient size to meet their future financial objectives. Over these longer time periods, a willingness to experience short-term declines in portfolio value in order to meet longer-term objectives may be appropriate. (To read more on this topic, see <em>Long-Term Investing: Hot or Not?</em>) </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</p>
<p></strong>This chapter has examined the impact of inflation and taxes on a portfolio's performance. Investors must carefully consider the impact that these two forces will have on their ability to meet their financial goals when structuring a portfolio. When seeking to combat inflation, the opportunity for capital appreciation becomes an important consideration. In order to mitigate the effects of taxes, investors should carefully consider the differing treatment of income and capital gains in some tax codes. For all tax issues, consultation with an expert is advised.</p>
<p>Investors with very long-term time horizons may find that a focus upon safety and income is not appropriate. For instance, younger individuals saving for retirement may be better served by focusing on capital appreciation. Individuals with a long-term time horizon will find that they are better able to withstand short-term portfolio declines as they structure a portfolio designed to meet their long-term financial goals.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Stocks and Dividends</h2>

<p>While many people think of stocks as an option for portfolio growth, stocks can also be an attractive alternative for generating current income. Many stocks provide income in the form of dividends, and high dividend-paying stocks can form an important portion of a portfolio designed for safety and income. Furthermore, although an investment in stocks can potentially result in a loss of principal, stocks also offer more growth potential than many other income-generating assets. This is an important consideration because even in a portfolio focused upon safety and income, some capital appreciation is often desirable. With that in mind, this chapter of the tutorial will examine the use of stocks for generating income. (For more, see <em>Build A Dividend Portfolio That Grows With You</em>.)</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Dividends and Stock Returns</p>
<p>It may surprise some readers to learn that over time, reinvested dividends provide one of the largest components of total stock market return. In fact, since 1988 the cumulative total return (including reinvested dividends) of the S&amp;P 500 is 481%. However, if we deduct dividends and focus only on price appreciation, the cumulative return is only 258%. This shows just how important dividends are to a stock portfolio, even one focused upon growth.</p>
<p><strong>High Dividend-Paying Stocks</p>
<p></strong>Dividends change over time as companies become more or less profitable and as investors shift their emphasis from capital appreciation to current income. However, there are certain types of stocks that have traditionally paid large dividends. Historically, companies that are large and well-established pay higher dividends than those that are small or new. Therefore, investors are probably better off focusing on an index such as the S&amp;P 500 for dividends as opposed to an index such as the Russell 2000.</p>
<p>Additionally, rapidly growing industries and companies often pay low (or no) dividends because they prefer to reinvest their profits into the business. On the other hand, slower growing industries and companies have a tendency to offer higher dividend payouts. For instance, technology and biotech companies often pay little or no dividends while utility and drug companies are well known for offering high dividend yields. (For more, check out <em>Dividend Facts You May Not Know</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>Safe Stocks</strong></p>
<p>In many instances, it may be appropriate for an investor whose primary portfolio aim is safety and income to own some stocks. In these instances though, the investor will likely wish to minimize the risk of their stock portfolio to the extent possible. One way to do this is to invest in broad-based indexes of stocks as opposed to individual stocks. Investing in this manner produces greater diversification and reduces the risk that a large holding of a single stock will perform poorly. Generally speaking, high dividends come from mature, stable companies with consistent earnings streams. These are often the same companies whose stock prices are unlikely to display exceptional volatility. Therefore, a focus upon income generating stocks can often also result in a portfolio of relatively low volatility stocks.</p>
<p>
Investors should be aware of the relative stability of the dividends they are receiving from their stocks. While coupon payments from bonds or certificates of deposit are contractually guaranteed, dividends are paid at the discretion of the company. While many companies are committed to paying dividends at a consistent level, this can and does sometimes change. For instance, when a company experiences financial difficulty or the overall economy enters a downturn many companies choose to conserve cash in order to fortify their balance sheets. A common way in which they do this is to reduce or eliminate the dividend payout to common shareholders. Investors who depend on stock dividends to meet a portion of their living expenses should carefully calculate the impact that this could have on their finances.</p>
<p><strong>Preferred Stocks</p>
<p></strong>In addition to common stocks, some investors may wish to consider preferred stocks. Preferred stocks sit somewhere between common stocks and bonds in a company's capital structure. This means that they are usually considered to be less safe than corporate bonds, but safer than common stocks. Preferred stocks do not offer as much opportunity for capital appreciation as common stocks, but investors are usually compensated with higher current income. Additionally, preferred stockholders have to be paid their dividends before any leftover cash may be paid out to common shareholders, making preferred dividends more stable than common dividends.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that companies often have the option of withholding preferred stock dividend payments during difficult periods. That means that income from preferred stocks is less certain than that from bonds. Furthermore, in times of financial distress, a company's preferred stock represents a more risky holding than that same company's bonds. Still, preferred stocks may represent an attractive option for investors seeking current income; as always though appropriate research and diversification are imperative if an investor is to build a secure portfolio. (For more on this topic, read <em>A Primer On Preferred Stock</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</p>
<p></strong>This chapter of the tutorial has examined the use of common and preferred stocks as part of a safety and income portfolio. It is important that investors are aware that both common and preferred stocks carry greater risks than many of the other investment alternatives discussed in this tutorial. However, stocks also provide greater potential for capital appreciation and may be appropriate as one component of investors' portfolios. The stocks that an investor does hold should be very well diversified and should primarily consist of large-cap companies with stable earnings and a long history of consistent dividend payments. Furthermore, an investor must carefully consider the possibility that future dividends may be reduced or eliminated; the investor can then properly evaluate what impact such a move might have on their financial position.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Bonds</h2>

<p>When investing for safety and income, bonds are one of the most attractive asset classes. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the characteristics of bonds that make them an ideal option for safety and income. We will also look at what types of bonds would not be appropriate in constructing a safe investment portfolio, before concluding by looking at some of the components of an ideal bond portfolio. (For a background reading, see our tutorial on <em>Advanced Bond Concepts</em>.)</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Why Bonds Are Ideal for Safety and Income</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, bonds are considered safer than stocks and when dealing with investment grade rated bonds, the risk of a loss of principal is generally small (although not negligible.) Bonds issued by the United States government, U.S. government agencies, highly-rated municipalities, and highly-rated corporations have historically offered principal safety and attractive levels of current income.</p>
<p>Bonds provide consistent income due to their periodic coupon payments. Furthermore, bond issuers are contractually obligated to make these coupon payments; in most instances failure to do so allows bondholders to force the issuer into bankruptcy. Therefore, bond issuers view timely payment of all interest and principal as an extremely high priority. This enhances the likelihood that bondholders will receive their payments as scheduled.</p>
<p>Corporate bond coupon payments are considered more stable than company dividend payments. That is because companies are legally bound to pay interest on their bonds before considering payment of any preferred or common stock dividends. Finally, many other investment options have infinite life spans, but bonds have stated final maturities. This means that, in the absence of a default, an investor knows exactly when they will receive their principal back as well as the exact dates on which they will receive income distributions in the interim. This cash flow certainty is an invaluable benefit to investors dependent upon portfolio income to meet their ongoing expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Bonds to Avoid</p>
<p></strong>While most bonds make attractive additions to a portfolio designed for safety and income, there are some bonds that might not be appropriate. In constructing a safe portfolio, an investor should focus on investment-grade rated bonds. These are bonds that carry a minimum credit rating of 'BBB' or higher. Bonds that would fall into this category include US Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, most mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment grade rated municipal securities, and investment grade rated corporate bonds. Bonds that are considered less safe include high yield junk bonds (rated below BBB), emerging market bonds and some securitized products. (To learn more, see <em>Junk Bonds: Everything You Need To Know</em>.)</p>
<p>
Although bonds carry a promise that the principal will be repaid at a stated maturity date, circumstances do arise in which an investor might want (or need) to sell their bond prior to maturity. In anticipation of this possibility, it is important to realize that the longer the maturity of a bond the greater an investor's exposure to possible capital loss if he or she wishes to sell prior to maturity because long-term bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, investors interested in safety should concentrate on bonds with maturities of 10 years or less. Generally speaking, bonds with maturities beyond 10 years do not offer substantially higher income, but they do carry a greater possibility of capital loss if an investor wishes to sell prior to maturity.</p>
<p>Investors interested in cash flow should also be aware that some types of bonds do not offer reliable income payments. For instance, zero coupon bonds do not offer current income but instead sell at a discount to their face values. With these bonds, investors profit from the difference between their purchase price and the final maturity value. In the interim though, investors do not receive any income, making them inappropriate for investors who depend on current cash flow.</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities also may not be appropriate for investors seeking consistent income. That is because instead of paying principal upon final maturity, these types of securitized products usually pay both principal and interest on a monthly basis, meaning that their cash flow pattern is more irregular than that from most other types of bonds. Because of these irregular cash flows, securitized products offer additional compensation, making them an attractive option for some investors. However, if stable income is a priority, an investor should consider other types of bonds.</p>
<p><strong>Building a Safe Bond Portfolio</p>
<p></strong>What is considered an "optimal" bond portfolio will differ depending on an investor's circumstances and objectives, but some general advice can be given. A bond portfolio should be concentrated in highly rated, investment grade securities and should be invested in a wide range of maturities. When investing in bonds it is also important to realize that their long-term returns are lower than those of stocks. Therefore, fees have a greater impact on an investor's total return in the bond market than in the stock market. This means that while focusing on fees it is always prudent when investing, it becomes even more important when constructing a bond portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This chapter has discussed how in many ways bonds are the ideal asset class for investors interested in safety and income. Investors should still tread carefully though, by minimizing their use of risky bond types such as emerging market bonds and high-yield bonds and concentrating their holdings in those bonds with maturities of 10 years or less. Investors interested in income should also focus on bonds that provide a steady stream of cash flows. An ideal fixed-income portfolio for many individuals will be comprised of government securities, government agency securities, high-grade corporate securities and high-grade municipal securities (in taxable accounts.) Such a portfolio will provide a steady stream of income with minimal risk of principal loss. (For more, check out <em>Top 4 Strategies For Managing A Bond Portfolio</em>.)</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Banks</h2>

<p>There are many investment options available at the local bank. Because they specialize in savings and investment alternatives that are designed to provide safety and income, banks can be a great place to store rainy day funds or cash that might be needed in the not-too-distant future. Although many banks also offer brokerage services, these services function similarly to those found at standalone brokerage firms, so in this chapter of the tutorial we will focus on traditional "bank products" as opposed to stocks, bonds or other products that might be sold through the bank's brokerage unit. This chapter will also examine the benefits and drawbacks of traditional bank products when compared to brokered products.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Savings and Money Market Accounts</p>
<p>The most common investment alternative available at the bank is the savings or money market account. These accounts are often linked to a checking account. However, while checking accounts are designed to fund ongoing expenses, the savings or money market account is designed as an investment tool to collect excess funds. Benefits of a savings or money market account include easy access to funds, safety and familiarity. However, they generally provide very low returns and over time may not even keep pace with the rate of inflation. (See our <em>Money Market Tutorial </em>for more on the topic.)</p>
<p><strong>Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</p>
<p></strong>Certificates of deposit (CDs) are alternatives to savings and money market funds. With a CD, an individual deposits money in the bank and agrees to keep it on deposit for a stated period of time. The maturity of CDs can range from very short (one month) to fairly long (five years or more.) Regardless of the maturity, the two defining characteristics of the CD are that the money cannot be accessed prior to maturity (without penalty) and the rate of interest is usually higher than on a money market account.</p>
<p>CDs provide an attractive alternative for individuals saving for a rainy day or an anticipated future cash flow. Using CDs allows an individual to earn a slightly higher rate of interest than if the money had been left in a savings account and also helps remove the temptation to spend the money before it is truly needed. CD rates vary widely from bank to bank so it often pays to comparison shop before depositing money into a CD. (If you're looking for bigger yields with limited risk, callable certificates of deposit (CD) might be right for you. (Learn more in our article <em>Callable CDs: Check The Fine Print.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Bank Products</p>
<p></strong>For investors concerned with safety, the most important benefit of investing at the bank is the principal protection that many of these alternatives provide. Many countries protect bank depositors against losses in order to guard against the possibility of a run on the bank and accompanying financial crisis. In the U.S., this protection comes in the form of FDIC insurance. FDIC stands for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the FDIC guarantees all deposits up to a certain level. Historically, the insurance amount has been $100,000, but in 2009 the insurance amount was temporarily increased to $250,000, and is scheduled to go back to $100,000 in 2014. This means that bank deposits, money market accounts and certificates of deposit are guaranteed by the U.S. government, making them among the safest investment alternatives an individual might consider. (Learn if your assets will be protected if your bank goes belly up, in <em>Bank Failure: Will Your Assets Be Protected?</em>)</p>
<p>
Another advantage is that an individual often already has a relationship at the bank through a checking account, mortgage, or credit card. Therefore, using bank investment options does not require finding another firm with which an individual is comfortable doing business. Furthermore, consolidating one's finances in a single location reduces the number of monthly statements and makes it easier to view an entire portfolio in a holistic manner. Finally, banks are often very well known in the community and a sense of familiarity can provide comfort to individuals unfamiliar with some other investment options.</p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</p>
<p></strong>While investing at the bank provides many benefits, there are also some drawbacks to consider. Because banks primarily focus on very safe, short-term investment alternatives, the returns that they offer are generally low. Therefore, while some of the options available may be appropriate for investors primarily concerned with safety, investors interested in portfolio growth may need to look beyond the bank. Investors interested in income may also find that although there are attractive alternatives at the bank, better possibilities may exist for those investors willing to consider brokerage products.</p>
<p>A second drawback of investing in a bank is that many of their offerings suffer from a lack of liquidity. While brokered products (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) can generally be sold if an investor decides to reallocate their portfolio or needs the cash, many bank products do not have a secondary market available. This is less of an issue with money market accounts as an investor can simply request a disbursement from their account. However, in the case of CDs, investors who want their money prior to maturity often must pay a penalty for doing so. Penalties vary, but they can include the loss of interest earned on the investment, thereby negating the benefit of purchasing the CD in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>This chapter has examined the role of bank products in an investor's growth and income portfolio. Investors with small portfolios may find that the bank is an attractive starting point for an investment program. These investors can use money market funds or certificates of deposit as they begin to build their savings, later on expanding into other investment alternatives. Investors with larger portfolios should probably only consider bank products for a portion of their investment portfolio. In addition to bank products, these investors will want to purchase stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investment products through a brokerage firm. These brokered products often offer greater return potential and may have comparable principal protection. Therefore, brokered products should make up the bulk of most portfolios. Investors can then use the bank for money market funds, certificates of deposit, and other short-term cash investments.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Guaranteed-Income Products</h2>

<p>By Brian Perry</p>
<p>Some individuals who are interested in safety and income may find that guaranteed income products are appropriate for their needs. While these products have their benefits, they also come with some drawbacks. Therefore, very careful consideration must be given prior to deciding whether these are appropriate. In this section, we will examine some of the characteristics of guaranteed income products as well as some of their benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>What is a guaranteed-income product?</p>
<p>There are two main types of guaranteed income products. The first of these, often referred to as an annuity, is essentially a product where, for an initial investment, an individual receives a guaranteed income stream for the remainder of his or her life. Annuities can be further broken down into fixed-rate and variable-rate products. A fixed-rate annuity guarantees a certain level of income for the term of the annuity; there is no risk that the cash flow from the product will decrease, but it is possible that inflation will gradually eat away at the value of the income stream. A variable-rate annuity is linked to the performance of an investment portfolio; income levels can fluctuate and even decline, but also have a better chance of keeping pace with inflation.</p>

<p>The second main type of guaranteed income product is the reverse mortgage. In a reverse mortgage, homeowners receive monthly payments from the reverse mortgage lender for the remainder of their lives. At the time of their death, the money they have received must be repaid to the lender by the estate, or possession of the house is granted to the lender. The decision to take out a reverse mortgage can be a difficult one to make, and cases of predatory lending have been reported. The AARP, an American organization dedicated to protecting the elderly and retired, has extensive free resources designed to protect senior citizens from potentially unjust lending practices. Anyone considering a reverse mortgage should gather as much information as possible before carefully considering whether a reverse mortgage is appropriate. (See <em>Is a Reverse Mortgage Right For You? </em>to learn more.)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Guaranteed-Income Products</p>
<p></strong>Guaranteed-income products essentially function like a pension plan by providing consistent monthly income payments to retirees. The main benefit of these products is that they remove the possibility that individuals will outlive their assets. Guaranteed-income products also make budgeting simpler because monthly cash flow is known in advance and is not dependent on financial market conditions. Finally, these products protect retirees from a sharp market decline that could harm their portfolio and force them to reduce their standard of living.</p>
<p>
<strong>Drawbacks of Guaranteed-Income Products</p>
<p></strong>While stable income for life is an enticing proposition, guaranteed-income products do have several disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is that individuals are generally locked into a relatively low rate of return. In other words, if an investor buys a diversified stock and bond portfolio instead of purchasing an annuity, portfolio growth over time may ultimately provide a higher level of income than the annuity offers. This means that in exchange for the peace of mind that comes with guaranteed income an individual sacrifices the possibility of higher returns. Costs can also be high with guaranteed income products and are not always readily apparent. This makes comparison shopping absolutely vital when considering these products.</p>
<p>A second drawback of guaranteed-income products is that they often suffer from a lack of liquidity. In other words, once an individual has committed to an investment in a guaranteed-income product they may not be able to reverse their decision. As well, these products may not keep pace with the rate of inflation. In other words, the income the individual receives will gradually be worth less in real dollar terms as time goes by. Some newer guaranteed-income products offer protection against this in the form of cost-of-living adjustments; however, it is important to remember that the investor does not get something for nothing. Future cost-of-living adjustments are priced into the cost of the product.</p>
<p>Guaranteed-income products are also unattractive options if an individual dies at an early age. The longer the individual lives, the more annual income payments they receive, and the higher the "return" on their initial investment. An early death results in fewer income payments, and therefore a less attractive investment return. Therefore, general health and life expectancy are important considerations prior to purchasing a guaranteed income product. It is also important to determine whether a spouse is going to be included in the guaranteed income contract; if so, plans should be made for the annual income payments to continue as long as <em>either</em> spouse is alive.</p>
<p>Finally, guaranteed-income products may not be appropriate options for individuals interested in leaving a bequest to their heirs. Individuals interested in providing for future generations might be better off building a traditional investment portfolio, spending what is necessary during their lives, and then leaving the remainder to their heirs.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</p>
<p></strong>Guaranteed-income products are perhaps the most controversial of the asset classes discussed in this tutorial. The benefit of these products is quite clear - the individual no longer needs to fear outliving their assets, and receives a consistent income for the remainder of their lives. However, there are significant costs to these products, including: potentially below-market returns, potentially declining real income, the risk of an early death, a lack of liquidity and reduced options for estate planning. Furthermore, high price structures are sometimes built into these products, and stories of predatory lending practices are common.</p>
<p>As the investment community begins to focus more closely on the needs of the retiring and the elderly, guaranteed-income products will likely become more standardized and more transparent. In fact, this process is already occurring. Still, individuals interested in guaranteed-income products are strongly advised to thoroughly investigate their characteristics, consult the free resources that are available, and do business only with the most reputable of providers. If individuals take these precautions, they may find that guaranteed-income products provide them with consistent income and peace of mind.

<h2>Safety and Income: Real Assets - Gold, Real Estate and Collectibles</h2>

<p>The term "real assets" refers to a broad category of investment options that are characterized by the fact that they are tangible (as opposed to stocks, bonds, and CDs which are "paper" assets.) Real assets, also sometimes called hard assets, can play an important part in any investment portfolio - including those focused on safety and income. However, there are some important caveats and additional considerations that come with investing in real assets. This chapter will discuss several different categories of real assets and analyze their benefits and drawbacks when it comes to investing for safety and income.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Real Estate</p>
<p>Due to the sharp real estate correction that occurred between 2006 and 2009, many individuals are hesitant to invest in real estate. However, real estate has provided an attractive investment alternative for many years and will likely continue to do so in the future. When talking about real estate, we must differentiate between actually owning physical real estate and owning securities that represent an interest in real estate assets.</p>
<p>Physically owning real estate can provide an excellent store of value and a hedge against inflation. Rental properties (whether residential or commercial) can also provide relatively consistent cash flow for investors seeking income. However, there are several factors investors must consider when purchasing physical real estate. Physical real estate investment can be time-consuming and can be prone to difficulties that are not present in other types of investing (i.e. fixing a broken water heater or dealing with difficult tenants.) Furthermore, real estate often requires a substantial initial investment, which can make it difficult for smaller investors to build a diversified portfolio. Finally, real estate is less liquid than most other asset classes making it difficult for investors to raise cash if necessary.</p>
<p>An easier way of owning real estate is to purchase securities backed by real estate properties. These securities can be stocks (real estate investment trusts, or REITs) or bonds (mortgage-backed securities or commercial mortgage-backed securities.) When purchasing these securities, it is important to analyze the underlying real estate that backs them in order to determine how stable the cash flows are likely to be. Although owning real estate securities is easier in many ways than owning physical real estate, an investor does lose the benefit of owning a real asset. All told, investors with the willingness and ability to invest directly in real estate should probably do so; investors with smaller portfolios or those who are uninterested in the effort required for direct real estate purchases should consider securities backed by real estate.

<p><strong>Gold</p>
<p></strong>For thousands of years, investors have viewed gold as one of the best stores of value, and therefore one of the safest investments in the world. In times of crisis or market panic, investors often flock to the safety of gold, pushing its price higher. Furthermore, gold is traditionally considered a good inflation hedge and during times of inflation the price tends to rise. Despite these benefits, gold has not been an exceptional long-term investment and has suffered through lengthy periods of underperformance, which are generally followed by shorter periods of strong gains.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, gold may be an appropriate holding as part of a diversified portfolio focused on safety. However, it is important to remember that gold does not provide any income and is therefore not appropriate for investors interested in generating cash flow from their portfolios.</p>
<p>Investors have several options for purchasing gold. First, they can go out and buy physical gold in the form of bullion or gold coins. This approach has several disadvantages, including the need to store the precious metal and keep it safe. An easier approach is to purchase shares in an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of gold. This provides exposure to the price of gold without the necessity of storing the underlying assets. The drawback is that the ETF will charge a management fee which will slightly reduce the investor's total return on gold. A third method of tracking the price of gold is to purchase futures or options on gold; while this is an appropriate method for some investors, those most interested in safety should probably seek other alternatives. Finally, an investor can purchase the shares of companies involved in the gold industry. This method provides less direct exposure to the price of gold and is probably less desirable for investors interested in owning "real assets."  (See <em>Does It Still Pay To Invest In Gold?</em> to find out the merits of investing in gold.)</p>
<p><strong>Collectibles</p>
<p></strong>Collectibles such as silver, jewelry, art, or even stamps and comic books can all be considered real assets. Many of these assets may act as a store of value and provide safety to an investor's portfolio while holding the potential for capital gains. However, most of these markets are highly specialized and investors should have a clear understanding of what they're getting into.</p>
<p>Many of these collectibles are intended to be purchased as part of a hobby or for other intangible purposes. Therefore, individuals will face unique challenges when attempting to navigate these markets with the intention of making an investment. Some of these challenges include a lack of information, difficulty finding available inventory, a lack of reliable pricing data, high storage costs, and very large differences in the prices at which similar items can be bought or sold. Also, most of these assets do not generate any income. All of these factors contribute to make many collectibles inappropriate for the average investor.</p>

<p>If an individual is interested in collectibles as part of a hobby or for aesthetic reasons, and if the investment aspect is seen as a bonus, these assets may very well form a reasonable portion of a diversified portfolio. Likewise, if an individual has some unique advantage and presents an unusual ability to profit in these markets, they should certainly pursue that opportunity. However, the majority of investors should probably leave collectibles to those truly passionate about them and instead focus on more traditional asset classes. (Read <em>Contemplating Collectible Investments </em>to learn more.)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This chapter discussed real estate, gold and collectibles. Investing in these real assets poses unique challenges not faced in many other investment options. Investors should carefully consider these challenges before deciding whether to include real assets as part of a diversified investment portfolio. If, after carefully considering the challenges, investors do decide to purchase real assets, they will find that they often serve as an excellent store of value and as a hedge against inflation. As such, they could form a valuable component of a portfolio focused on safety of principal. However, gold and collectibles do not generate income, making them inappropriate for individuals interested in generating cash flow.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Safety, Income and the Optimal Portfolio</h2>

<p>By Brian Perry<strong></strong></p>
<p>When constructing a portfolio, the primary consideration is to build the portfolio that is most likely to help an investor achieve his or her financial goals. This optimal portfolio can vary greatly depending on an investor's unique return objectives and risk tolerance. This chapter will discuss how an emphasis on safety and income can be integrated into the portfolio process to help an investor build an optimal portfolio.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Return Objectives</p>
<p>When building an investment portfolio, an investor must determine what it is that they are trying to accomplish. For an individual, this can be any one of many things. An individual may be investing to build a retirement portfolio, to purchase a new home or to build a rainy day fund. These objectives will carry with them different time horizons, which means that the optimal portfolio in each instance is quite different. When the time horizon is very long, such as for some retirement investment programs, a portfolio can be invested in a more aggressive manner. When the time horizon is short or the funds are intended to serve as an emergency backstop, an emphasis on safety becomes more important.</p>
<p>In addition to capital appreciation, a goal of an investment program may be to generate income to meet expenses. This is particularly true for individuals who are retired or who depend on their portfolios for ongoing income. For these individuals, income becomes an important consideration when structuring a portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Tolerance</p>
<p></strong>Perhaps the most important question an individual needs to ask when constructing an investment portfolio is: "what is my risk tolerance?" The combination of return objectives and risk tolerance will then determine the optimal portfolio and the optimal asset allocation. Again, time horizon plays an important role in determining risk tolerance. The longer the time horizon, the more risk an investor is able to take. The shorter the time horizon, the more cautious an individual should be in his or her investment approach.</p>
<p>The above discussion focuses on the ability to take risk, but there is another important consideration in determining risk tolerance. In addition to <em>ability</em> to take risk, investors should also carefully consider their <em>willingness</em> to take risk. These two factors are not always in alignment. For instance, an investor with a long-term goal may have the ability to take on additional portfolio risk, but if the thought of losing money keeps them awake at night they might not have the willingness to take much risk.</p>
<p>
Investors should attempt to align their ability and their willingness to take risk. However, in situations where ability and willingness provide conflicting signals, investors should defer to that which is more conservative. In other words, if an investor has the ability to take risk but not the willingness, they should take less risk. On the other hand, even if an investor is aggressive by nature, if their objectives are short-term in nature, they should probably invest conservatively. (Learn more about this important topic in our article <em>Risk Tolerance Only Tells Half The Story.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Safety, Income and Growth</p>
<p></strong>Safety, income and growth are the three main objectives within an investment portfolio. The degree of emphasis placed on each of these goals will differ depending on an individual investor's return objectives and risk tolerance. Cautious investors will emphasize safety, while aggressive investors will emphasize growth. Likewise, investors who require cash flows from the portfolio will emphasize income while with no need for income will emphasize growth.</p>
<p>While the degree of emphasis on these three objectives will vary, under most circumstances investors should not exclude one. For instance, even in the most cautious of investment programs, attention should be paid to growing the portfolio enough to keep pace with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even aggressive investors with long-term time horizons should pay strict attention to risk management, as large losses in a portfolio can be difficult to overcome even over long time periods. Finally, regardless of whether an individual intends to withdraw cash from the account, income is responsible for a large portion of total return in investment portfolios over time; therefore, investors that ignore this crucial component do so to their own detriment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</p>
<p></strong>In general, younger investors will have a reduced emphasis on safety and income while older investors will focus more closely on these goals. Likewise, individuals with short-term time horizons will primarily focus on safety while those with longer-term objectives will be interested in growing the portfolio. Importantly though, investors should seek to balance both safety and growth within the portfolio management process; the precise emphasis will vary depending on unique circumstances, but neither should be ignored. Finally, regardless of whether withdrawals are intended from the portfolio, income can help to produce superior total return in a portfolio over time.</p>



<h2>Safety and Income: Conclusion</h2>

<p>By Brian Perry</p>
<p>This tutorial has examined investment alternatives that might appeal to individuals interested in safety of principal and current income. The tutorial began with a discussion of the importance of income as a component of overall portfolio returns as well as an examination of why safety is an important consideration of all investment portfolios.</p>

<p>There are important caveats to consider when focusing on safety and income - in particular, the impact of inflation and taxes on investment performance. Focus on safety and income is not appropriate for investors with very long-term time horizons, but all investors should attempt to achieve at least some principal growth in their portfolio.</p>
<p>We also looked at the various asset classes that might be appropriate for investors seeking safety and income. Examining stocks is an important part of safety and income, as you can find the appropriate stock for your portfolio. These can be preferred stocks, as well as the common stocks of large, stable companies that have a long track record of paying dividends.</p>
<p>Bonds are possibly the best overall alternative for investors seeking safety and income. Investors were cautioned to avoid riskier bonds, such as high-yield or emerging market securities, and to concentrate the maturities of their bonds in the 10-year and under sector.</p>
<p>
For safety and income investors, investment alternatives can also be found at the bank. Most of these options are designed for short-term, very safe investing and may not provide reasonable returns for investors with a long-term time horizon. Nevertheless, certificates of deposit and money market funds can provide a valuable tool for investors looking to place excess cash for a temporary period or saving for a rainy day. We also looked at guaranteed-income products. These products provide consistent income and peace of mind while removing the risk of outliving one's assets. However, individuals should carefully evaluate whether these products are superior to other investment alternatives and should be wary of high costs and potentially predatory lending practices.</p>
<p>The tutorial also touched on investing in real assets. Real assets include gold, real estate and collectibles. These real assets pose special challenges to investors, and often do not provide current income. However, they can serve as an excellent inflation hedge and store of value and may therefore be appropriate for well-diversified investors seeking safety.</p>
<p>We concluded this tutorial with an analysis of the role of safety and income within a larger portfolio. Depending on a person's risk tolerance or stage of life, a portfolio focused upon safety and income may not be appropriate. Growth is also important, and a well diversified approach to meeting once financial goals usually includes a balanced emphasis upon growth, safety, and income. The exact weighting of these financial goals will depend on an individual's unique objectives, but under almost any circumstances at least some emphasis should be placed upon all three goals.</p>
