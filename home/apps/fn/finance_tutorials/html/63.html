<h1>Passive Vs. Active Management</h1>



<p>In almost all economic endeavors, the quality of management is generally a key component of a successful operation. Managing a mutual fund is no exception to this rule. The fund investment quality we are going to discuss in this section focuses on two important fund managerial qualities: tenure and structure. However, it is worth noting that a fund's investing style, growth, risk and return profile, trading activity, costs and performance are also all a product of management's efforts. How well management "scores" in all these areas is an important consideration for mutual fund investors. </p>
<p><strong>Managed Funds Vs. Index Funds</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, we need to make a distinction between mutual funds that are managed and those that are indexed. The former are actively managed by an individual manager, co-managers, or a team of managers. The index funds are passively managed, which means that their portfolios mirror the components of a market index. For example, the well-known Vanguard 500 Index fund is invested in the 500 stocks of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index on a market capitalization basis. </p>
<p>Which is better, managed or indexed fund investing? Both have their positive aspects. Let us first look at the index variety. </p>
<p><em>Index Mutual Funds</em></p>
<p>Index mutual funds are an easily understood, relatively safe approach to investing in broad segments of the market. They are used by less experienced investors as well as sophisticated institutional investors with large portfolios. Indexing has been called investing on autopilot. The metaphor is an appropriate one as managed funds can be viewed as having a pilot at the controls. When it comes to flying an airplane, both approaches are widely used. </p>
<p>Here is how an index fund works. The money going into an index fund is automatically invested proportionately into individual stocks or bonds according to the percentage their market capitalizations represent in the index. For example, if IBM represents 1.7% of the S&amp;P 500 Index, for every $100 invested in the Vanguard 500 Fund, $1.70 goes into IBM stock. (For more on index funds, see <em>Index Investing</em>.)</p>

<p>David Swensen, an investment expert, author and former chief investment officer of Yale University's highly successful endowment fund, makes a strong case for indexing. In his 2005 book, "Unconventional Success", he concludes that because "most individual investors lack the specialized knowledge necessary to succeed in today's highly competitive investment markets â€¦ passive index funds are most likely to satisfy investor aspirations."</p>
<p>Swensen, and a high percentage of investment professionals, find index investing compelling for the following reasons:  </p>
<ul><li>Simplicity. Broad-based market index funds make asset allocation and diversification easy.     </li><li>Management quality. The passive nature of indexing eliminates any concerns about human error or management tenure.     </li><li>Low portfolio turnover. Less buying and selling of securities means lower costs and fewer tax consequences.     </li><li>Low operational expenses. Indexing is considerably less expensive than active fund management.     </li><li>Asset bloat. Portfolio size is not a concern with index funds.     </li><li>Performance. It is a matter of record that index funds have outperformed the majority of managed funds over a variety of time periods. </li></ul><em>Managed Mutual Funds</em></p>
<p>Well-run managed funds that have long-term performance records that are above their peer and category benchmarks are also excellent investing opportunities. There are a number of top-rated fund managers that consistently deliver exceptional results. Such well-run funds will register very high on the Fund Investment-Quality Scorecard you are learning about in these pages. </p>
<p>It is worth remembering that despite their impressive long-term records, even top-rated fund managers can have bad years. Such an occurrence is little cause to abandon a fund run by a highly respected manager. Typically, managers will stick to their fundamental strategies and not be swayed to experiment with tactics geared to improving results over the short term. This type of posture best serves the long-term interests of fund investors. </p>
<p>


<p>In recent years, a number of fund management-related issues have received more public attention in the financial press than in the past. These fall under the general heading of fund stewardship and include such issues as a manager's financial stake in a fund, performance fees and the composition of a fund's board of directors. </p>
<p>While the discussion on these issues is important, there is no universal agreement as to what constitutes appropriate standards of conduct. </p>
<p> By connecting shareholder and managerial interests, having managers investing significantly in the funds they manage seems like a good idea. Likewise, compensating managers on the basis of performance rather than as a percentage of a fund's assets also seems like a good thing. However, there are reasonable arguments that take an opposite point of view on both of these issues. Less controversial is the practice of having a majority of independent directors serve on a fund's board of directors. But here too, there continues to be differences of opinion. The good news for fund investors is that the debates surrounding these issues heighten public and regulatory awareness of what constitutes proper mutual fund stewardship. </p>

<h2>Fund I-Q No.4: Manager Tenure and Structure</h2>


<p>A long-term fund performance record, preferably over a 10-year period, provides the best indicator of a manager's investing abilities. Accordingly, one of the critical mutual fund investment qualities is to have a match of managerial tenure and this performance period, or at least one that covers a meaningful time span. </p>

<p>To illustrate this point, let us compare two different funds. The XYZ Fund has an annualized 10-year total return of 11% and has been run for those 10 years by the same manager. In the case of the ABC Fund, it has the same 10-year annualized total return of 1%, but it has had two different managers. One's tenure covered the first nine years and the second has only been on the job one year. (To learn how annualized returns are calculated, read <em>All Returns Are Not Created Equal</em>.) </p>
<p><strong>Managerial Tenure</strong></p>
<p>On our Fund Investment-Quality Scorecard, the XYZ Fund's current manager and performance would have a highly favorable 10-year match. We know that past results are no guarantee of future performance, but that experience is infinitely better than a crystal ball! In the case of the ABC Fund, the manager who produced 90% of the fund's excellent results is gone. Will the second manager be just as good? We hope so, and oftentimes that's the case - but things can also go in the other direction. </p>
<p>Common sense tells us that the more closely matched a manager's tenure is with a solid fund performance record, the better. Nevertheless, because managerial change is a fact of life in the mutual fund business, the free FundAlarm website can be very useful. This site puts fund manager changes in perspective by providing views on whether the change will be positive or negative for the fund's future performance. (For more on this topic, see <em>Will A New Fund Manager Cost You?</em> and <em>Should You Follow Your Fund Manager?</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Management Teams</strong></p>
<p>If a fund is run by a management team, the tenure issue becomes moot. There is always someone in the driver's seat that knows the road. And, while index funds have managers, their role is simply that of a technician making sure the mechanics of the index are working efficiently. In the case of a fund run by co-managers, it is assumed that, if there is a departure, there still remains a manager with experience at the helm. If that is not the case, the co-managed fund will have to be looked at as if it were run by a single manager and judged accordingly. </p>


<p>The solo fund manager is still much esteemed in the mutual fund industry, with some of them even reaching celebrity status. However, the trend in fund management is toward multiple managers. In some cases, co-mangers or team management can give a mutual fund higher investment quality than it would have with a single manager. Having said that, it must be recognized that there is a mutual fund managerial elite with outstanding long-term performance records. These managers are highly regarded, and deservedly so. </p>
<p>The Fund I-Q Scorecard includes an entry for a fund manager's personal investment in the fund being managed. Obviously, if a manager has a healthy amount of his or her own money invested in a fund, it would certainly have to be considered a confidence builder by the other fund investors. As alluded to previously, this information is not yet universally available and, admittedly, is not easily obtained by the general investing public. However, oftentimes, comment in this regard appears in the financial press and in Morningstar's commentary. And, if an investor considers it materially important to his or her investment decision, there's no harm done in putting the question directly to the fund's management. </p>

<h2>Scoring Fund Management Data</h2>


<p>This is the entry we need to complete in the Fund Investment-Quality Scorecard for an analysis of a fund's management tenure and structure: </p>
<p><strong></p>

</strong></p>


<p>For those funds with a solo manager, a "very positive" rating would go to a tenure-performance match of six to 10 years. A "positive" rating would apply to a three to five year match, and anything less than three years would be "sub-standard." For co-managed funds, at least one of the co-managers would have to qualify accordingly. </p>
<p>If a manager or managers have an investment position in the fund they are running, that's a definite plus. But, because there are circumstances that make the application of this qualifier problematic, it should not unduly influence the managerial analysis. </p>
<p>Value Line and Morningstar do give the name(s) and starting date(s) of a fund's manager(s). Value Line's fund report also provides a very useful numerical (1 highest to 5 lowest) "Manager Rating," measuring the manager's risk-adjusted performance relative to that of the fund's peer group. Morningstar will usually make some evaluative comment on managerial performance in the "Morningstar's Take" section of its report. </p>
