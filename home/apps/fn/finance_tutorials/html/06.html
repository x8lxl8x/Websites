<h1>Economic Indicators: Overview</h1>



<p>Every week there are dozens of economic surveys and indicators released. In the past, experienced professionals and economists have had an advantage in receiving this data in a timely fashion. Fortunately, the emergence of the internet has changed this situation by giving everyone access. </p>

<p>Economic indicators can have a huge impact on the market; therefore, knowing how to interpret and analyze them is important for all investors. In this tutorial, we'll cover some of the most important economic indicators. You'll learn where to find them, how to read them and what they can tell you about he health of the economy - and your investments. </p>

<h2>Economic Indicators: Beige Book</h2>

<p>

<table><tr valign="bottom"><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>Two Wednesdays before every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, 8 times per year</td></tr><tr valign="bottom"><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>2:00pm Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr valign="bottom"><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Anecdotal and discussion-based summaries of regional economic activity</td></tr><tr valign="bottom"><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>Federal Reserve Board; National summary authored by rotating Fed district</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.federalreserve.gov/FOMC/BeigeBook/2007/</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Made public in 1983, the <em>Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District</em>, or <em>Beige Book</em>, as it is known, has a different style and tone than many other indicators. Rather than being filled with raw data, the <em>Beige Book</em> takes a more conversational approach. The book has 13 sections in total; 12 regional reports from each of the member Fed district banks, preceded by one national summary drawn from the individual reports that follow it. This is the first chance investors have to see how the Fed draws logical and intuitive conclusions from the raw data presented in other indicator releases.</p>
<p>The <em>Beige Book</em> is published eight times per year, just before each of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. While it is used by committee members during the meeting itself, it does not carry more clout than other data values and indicators. There is a lot of real-time data that the Fed has at its disposal and, unfortunately, notes from the FOMC meetings themselves are currently not public information.</p>
<p>The <em>Beige Book</em> aims to give to give a broad overview of the economy, bringing many variables and indicators into the mix. Discussion will be about things such as labor markets, wage and price pressures, retail and ecommerce activity and manufacturing output. Investors can see comments that are forward-looking; the <em>Beige Book</em> will contain comments that look to predict trends and anticipate changes over the next few months or quarters.</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Beige Book</em> by itself is not likely to have a big effect on the markets in the short term, mainly because no new data series is presented here.    </p>
<p>Investors and Fed watchers look to the <em>Beige Book</em> to gain insight into the next FOMC meeting. Is there language that shows fear about inflation? Do the reports suggest that the economy needs a financial boost to continue growing? This is the critical information that will be analyzed in the <em>Beige Book</em>.</p>
<p>To read the <em>Beige Book</em> effectively, one must become accustomed to "Fed speak", a special verbiage of measured remarks intentionally designed to say a little without ever saying a lot. The last thing the Fed wants to do with its words is corner itself into a pre-supposed policy decision prior to the next FOMC meeting. Investors won't ever see a definitive statement about the Fed going one way or the other with monetary policy, but there may be valuable clues in the<em> Beige Book</em> - at least for the trained eye. (For related reading, see <em>Formulating Monetary Policy</em>.)</p>
<p>The Fed directors and their staffs will use their very long proverbial arms to obtain an economic pulse that can't be found in any other indicator's report. They will interview business leaders, bank presidents, members of other Fed boards and hundreds of other informal networks before writing the reports that will be compiled in the <em>Beige Book</em>.</p>
<p>Investors who hold investments that conduct business in specific regions of the country may find valuable information about how those areas are performing as a whole. For instance, a stockholder in a regional bank operating in the <place w:st="on">Southeastern U.S.</place> would want to know what the Atlanta Fed Bank says about the health of that region.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the Beige Book will give evidence that may contradict what a previous indicator has presented; the <em>Employment Report</em> may suggest that there is slack in the labor market, while <em>Beige Book</em> reports may give anecdotal evidence that wage pressures are forming, or that certain specific labor markets are tight. (For more on this topic, read <em>Surveying The Employment Report</em>.) </p>


<p>On rare occasions, the <em>Beige Book</em> will be released at a time when information is badly needed in the markets; shock events like the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or a stock market crash can effectively wipe the data slate clean, and investors will count on the Fed to help describe the relative state of affairs during these tumultuous times. </p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Contains forward-looking comments - the Fed districts aim to draw relative conclusions in the <em>Beige Book</em>, not just regurgitate facts already presented    </li><li>Gives investors a "man on the street" perspective of economic health by taking first-hand accounts from business owners, economist, and the like    </li><li>Aims to put pieces from different reports together into an explanatory whole, giving qualitative measurements instead of quantitative figures    </li><li>It's the only indicator that gives reports by geographic region, rather than just by industry group or sector.    </li><li>Most regions will report on the state of the service industries, an area not well covered in other indicator reports, although it is a large component of real gross domestic product. </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rarely is any new statistical data presented, only anecdotal reports    </li><li>Filled with measured "Fed-speak"    </li><li>Specific industry conclusions are hard to draw from the report.    </li><li>Each Fed district can use its discretion on what to include in its report; one region may discuss manufacturing activity while others don't report on the topic.    </li><li>Private forecasts compiled by economists and analysts tend to closely match what is reported in the <em>Beige Book</em>, so estimates rarely change following the release. </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</strong></p>
<p>The Beige Book is not likely to send shock waves through the market on its release, but it provides an original point of view about economic activity and is a marked departure from the dry raw data releases of the other indicators. It also gives investors insight into how the Fed approaches its monetary policy decisions and responsibilities.


<h2>Economic Indicators: Business Outlook Survey</h2>

<p>

<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>Third Thursday of the month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>12pm Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Current month\'s data</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.phil.frb.org/econ/bos/bosschedule.html</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</p>
<p></strong>The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's <em>Business Outlook Survey</em> (also known as the <em>Philadelphia Fed Report</em>) is a monthly survey of manufacturing purchasing managers conducting business around the tri-state area of <state w:st="on">Pennsylvania</state>, <state w:st="on">New Jersey</state> and <place w:st="on"><state w:st="on">Delaware</state></place>. The survey is conducted in the vein of the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report; it questions voluntary participants about their outlook on things such as employment, new orders, shipments, inventories and prices paid. Answers are given in the form of "better", "worse" or "same" as the previous month, and, as with the PMI, results are diffused into an index, only this index uses a median value for expansion of 0, rather than 50. The <em>Philly Fed Report</em> signals expansion when it is above zero and contraction when below. As a result, values can be negative month to month.</p>
<p>The survey has been conducted each month since May 1968, and is considered one of the most valuable regional purchasing manager indexes (There are currently almost 15 such regional reports, covering much of the <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">U.S.</place></country-region>, albeit in piecemeal fashion). </p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>As far as regional manufacturing reports go, the <em>Philly Fed Report</em> is one of the most watched, both for its early delivery to investors (released before the month is even over), and its blend of manufacturing sectors and businesses. The <em>Philly Fed Report</em>, along with the Chicago NAPM Index, have shown high correlations to the upcoming and hugely followed PMI report. </p>

<p>
This index isn't typically a big market mover (due to its small sample size and limited geographic range), but if a big surprise in terms of percentage change appears in the report, quick-thinking investors may anticipate similar changes to the PMI and make market moves accordingly. </p>
<p>The report is presented with solid commentary from the Reserve Bank itself, and often includes special survey questions that may be extremely timely if the economy is unsure of future growth possibilities. </p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Survey is very timely, coming out before the end of the month. It is the first regional report to be published.    </li><li>There are often special questions in the survey (like at year end) regarding things like prospects for company sales, or commodity and energy prices.    </li><li>The three states covered have a diverse mix of manufacturing sectors, from old line steel and coal to modern chemicals and semiconductors.    </li><li>The report is concise and readable. </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Only manufacturing sector is represented here    </li><li>Only covers three states    </li><li>Survey is very subjective and may be based on perceptions.    </li><li>Data can be very volatile month to month due to sample size. Changes of more than 50% in a month are not uncommon. </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Philly Fed Report</em> may be the most respected of all the regional purchasing manager reports. It should not be acted on in isolation, but it does represent a diverse area of the country, and has shown more than a 75% correlation to the upcoming PMI in studies. Therefore, it contains clues about the general market.</p>
<p>


<h2>Economic Indicators: Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)</h2>




<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>Last Tuesday of the month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>10am Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Previous Month\'s Data</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>The Conference Board</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.conference-board.org/economics/consumerConfidence.cfm</td></tr></table>

</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) is a monthly release from the Conference Board, a non-profit business group that is highly regarded by investors and the Federal Reserve. CCI is a unique indicator, formed from survey results of more than 5,000 households and designed to gauge the relative financial health, spending power and confidence of the average consumer. </p>
<p>There are three separate headline figures: one for how people feel currently (Index of Consumer Sentiment), one for how they feel the general economy is going (Current Economic Conditions), and the third for how they see things in six months' time (Index of Consumer Expectations). </p>
<p>The Consumer Sentiment Index is a component of the Conference Board's template of economic indicators. Historically, changes in this index (of the three released) has tracked the leading edge of the business cycle well.</p>
<p>There are other sentiment indicators that can sometimes be confused with the Consumer Sentiment report or used in conjunction with it, such as the University of Michigan Sentiment Report, and some investors will try to average the two reports to get their own sense of consumer sentiment. (For background reading, see <em>Understanding The Consumer Confidence Index </em>and <em>Consumer Confidence: A Killer Statistic</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>A strong consumer confidence report, especially at a time when the economy is lagging behind estimates, can move the market by making investors more willing to purchase equities. The idea behind consumer confidence is that a happy consumer - one who<em> feels</em> that his or her standard of living is increasing - is more likely to spend more and make bigger purchases, like a new car or home. </p>
<p>It is a highly subjective survey, and the results should be interpreted as such. People can grab onto a small situation that garners a lot of mainstream press, such as gas prices, and use that as their basis for overall economic conditions, fair or not. There are no real data sets here, and people are not economists, so they cannot be counted on to realize that, for example, because gas prices may only represent 5% of their expenses, they should not sour their entire economic outlook. </p>



<p>Because of its subjective nature and relatively small sample size, most economists will look at moving averages of between three and six months for consumer confidence figures before predicting a major shift in sentiment; some also feel that index level changes of at least five points are necessary before calling for the reversal of an existing trend. In general, however, rising consumer confidence will trend in line with rising retail sales and, personal consumption and expenditures<em>,</em> consumer-driven indicators that relate to spending patterns.</p>
<p>Regional breakdowns of the data are valuable for seeing the breadth of sentiment across the country, which can be a useful factor in the real estate market, along with indicators such as housing starts and existing home sales. </p>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>One of few indicators that reaches out to average households    </li><li>Has historically been a good predictor of consumer spending and, therefore, the gross domestic product (consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of real GDP) </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>A subjective survey with no physical data sets    </li><li>Small sample size (only 5,000 households)    </li><li>Survey results may contradict other indicators, such as <stockticker w:st="on">GDP</stockticker> and the <em>Labor Report</em> </li></ul><strong>The Closing Line</p>
<p></strong>Sentiment indicators can carry a lot of weight - there are so few that are standardized like Consumer Confidence and, in the final analysis, the happiness and spending ability of Joe Consumer is the most important determinant of an expanding economy.</p>
<p>


<h2>Economic Indicators: Consumer Credit Report</h2>



<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>About five weeks after month\'s end</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>3pm Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Monthly</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>Federal Reserve Board</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/</td></tr></table>

</p>

<p><strong>Background</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Consumer Credit Report</em> is a monthly release from the Federal Reserve Board that estimates changes in the dollar amounts of outstanding loans to individuals, funds which are mainly used to purchase consumer goods. Loans backed by real estate, such as <ins cite="mailto:%20" datetime="2007-04-04T13:45">home equity lines of credit</ins> (HELOCs), are not included in the survey. The two classes of credit covered are revolving and non-revolving credit; revolving credit can be increased by the consumer up to a limit without contacting the creditor (as in credit cards), while non-revolving terms are fixed at the time the loan (as with an auto loan).</p>
<p>Both classes are segmented into the categories below. The <em>Consumer Credit Report</em> shows the outstanding balances for each:</p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>Commercial banks    </li><li>Finance companies    </li><li>Credit unions    </li><li>Federal government &amp; Sallie Mae    </li><li>Savings institutions    </li><li>Non-financial businesses    </li><li>Securitized asset pools </li></ul></p>
<p>Average interest rates are shown for many types of consumer debt, such as auto loans, credit cards and bank loans, collectively showing investors the overall "credit quality" of consumers and where the highest rates of growth are occurring. </p>
<p>Data is collected through surveys of banks, finance companies, retail sales outfits and credit unions, among others. Each release will show the three previous months' results, including any revisions to recent periods, if they have occurred. (For related reading, see <em>Consumer Credit Report: What's On It</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</p>
<p></strong>Consumer credit is considered a good indicator of the potential future spending levels seen in the <em>Personal Consumption </em>and <em>Retail Sales </em>reports, and shows the extent to which benchmark interest rates such as the fed funds rate and prime rate have manifested themselves at the consumer level (it can take six months to a year for macro interest rates to work their way down to consumers). </p>
<p>The headline stats of this release will be total consumer debt (expressed in trillions and seasonally adjusted), the current annual run rate of growth or decline, and the total percentage of credit card delinquencies. The delinquencies are studied because sudden spikes may lead to fears that consumers are overextended in their debt levels. Some economists will try to compare the default percentages seen in the most recent recession as a breakpoint - if current default levels approach it, they will look for a recessionary trend to show itself in other economic indicators.</p>
<p>These factors are important when investors consider that consumers make up more than two-thirds of total GDP consumption. If consumers stop spending or face a credit crunch, GDP will not be able to grow much. Investors in consumer cyclical stocks should be keenly interested in consumers' ability to spend more in the future.</p>



<p>Consumer credit figures have a lot of seasonal and inherent volatility, so investors should always review the current report for adjustments to prior periods, paying particular attention to revisions to year-over-year growth. Long-term trends are the most studied portion of the report, both in the total outstanding balances as well as the change in overall interest rates being charged.</p>
<p>The Conference Board has tapped consumer credit as a lagging indicator, and uses a ratio of consumer credit to personal income as a component of its Index of Lagging Indicators. The Fed operates on the theory that consumers will not significantly increase their borrowing levels until their personal incomes increases enough to justify the higher debt load. As such, borrowing may show the largest increases when the economy is already coming out of a recession, rather than during the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>Contains detailed breakdown of auto loan figures, such as average maturity and prevailing interest rates    </li><li>Data is provided with and without seasonal adjustments.    </li><li>Release shows comparisons against previous month, previous year, and also against results from the last five years </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Only total growth in outstanding loans is shown; there is no way of knowing if consumer payments have fallen off or if new loan growth has slowed based on a falling consumer credit number (and vice versa).    </li><li>Absence of home-equity debt provides for an incomplete picture.    </li><li>Because it comes out after the consumer confidence report and retail sales reports for the month, some analysts will not look as intently at the consumer credit figures month to month, instead reviewing multi-period trends once or twice a year </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Consumer Credit Report</em> will not be a big catalyst in the markets because of earlier-released indicators, but it remains a good lagging indicator, especially when examined in conjunction with personal wage growth and interest rates. If prevailing rates are moderate and incomes are rising, consumer credit can grow in step without causing elevated fears in the market.


<h2>Economic Indicators: Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h2>



<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>Monthly, approximately mid-month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>8:30am Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Previous Month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.toc.htm</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the benchmark inflation guide for the <place w:st="on"><country-region w:st="on">U.S.</country-region></place> economy. It uses a "basket of goods" approach that aims to compare a consistent base of products from year to year, focusing on products that are bought and used by consumers on a daily basis. The price of your milk, eggs, toothpaste and hair cut are all captured in the CPI.</p>
<p>There are two presented <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> figures, the <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (<stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>-W), and the <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> for all Urban Consumers (<stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>-U). The most watched metric, Core <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> (with food and energy prices removed) is the CPI-U, which will usually be presented with a seasonal adjustment, as consumer patterns vary widely depending on the time of year. The current base year for the <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is 1982, so changes will typically be provided on a percentage basis to reflect only changes to prior index levels. Numbers will also be shown as an annual run rate of growth, to give investors a sense of the near-term inflationary outlook.</p>
<p>The Chain-Weighted <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is also released along with the Core <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>, and is gaining momentum as a metric worth following, as Chain-Weighted <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> captures the effects of consumer choice. Chain-weighted <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> numbers are considered by many to be more reflective of actual consumer patterns than fixed <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> figures, as the chain-weighted index accounts for the substitution and new product bias that exists in the fixed <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>. If a consumer buys one product over another because of a price hike in the first product, chain-weighted figures will capture this buying shift, while Core <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> will not. Core <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> will continue measuring the price of the good as it rises, regardless of whether fewer people are purchasing the product.  </p>
<p>The <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is an extremely detailed release, with breakouts for most major consumer groups (such as food and beverage, apparel, recreation, etc.) and geographical regions, which are supplied by the "CPI U.S. City Averages". (For background reading, see <em>The Consumer Price Index Controversy</em> and <em>The Consumer Price Index: A Friend To Investors</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>The <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is probably the single most important economic indicator available, if for no other reason than because it's very final<em>. </em>Many other indicators derive most of their value from the predictive ability of the <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>, so when this release arrives, many questions will be answered in the markets. This report will often move both equity and fixed-income markets, both the day of the release and on an ongoing basis. It may even set a new course in the markets for upcoming months. Analysts will be more sure of their convictions about what the Fed will do at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting after digesting the Consumer Price Index.</p>


<p>The <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is used to make adjustments to many cash flow mechanisms (pensions, Medicare, cost of living adjustments to insurance policies, etc.). As a result, most investors will find that the <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> affects them personally in some way. Fixed-income investors should always be aware of the rate of inflation against which they judge their investments; it is imperative to keep current yields ahead of inflation, or real wealth will fall. </p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Gives most insight into future Fed rate moves    </li><li>Highly watched and analyzed in the media    </li><li>Good regional and industry breakdowns for investor research </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>Volatile month to month    </li><li>Fixed <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> has certain biases (new product, substitution), which can distort results    </li><li>Exclusion of food and energy is only good for so long - these costs should be considered when assessing inflation </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</strong></p>
<p>The <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker> is one of the most important indicators in terms of moving the markets and setting monetary policy for the Fed. Consider looking at both the fixed and chain-weighted <stockticker w:st="on">CPI</stockticker>.


<h2>Economic Indicators: Durable Goods Report</h2>

<p>

<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>On or around the 20th of the month (advance release; revised release about six weeks after period end with <em>Factory Orders</em>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>8:30am Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Previous month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>U.S. Census Bureau</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.census.gov/indicator/www/m3/adv/</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Advance Report on Durable Goods Manufacturer's Shipments, Inventories and Orders</em>, or the <em>Durable Goods Report</em>, provides data on new orders received from more than 4,000 manufacturers of durable goods, which are generally defined as higher-priced capital goods orders with a useful life of three years or more, such as cars, semiconductor equipment and turbines.More than 85 industries are represented in the sample, which covers the entire <place w:st="on"><country-region w:st="on">United States</country-region></place>.</p>
<p>Figures are provided in current dollars along with percentage change from prior month and prior year for new orders, total shipments, total unfilled orders (orders that have been booked but not filled as of month-end) and inventories. Revisions are also included for the prior three months if they materially affect prior-released results.</p>
<p>The data compiled for consumer durable goods is one of the 10 components of the Conference Board's U.S. Leading Index, as growth at this level has typically occurred in advance of general economic expansion.</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors:</strong></p>
<p>The headline figure will often leave out transportation and defense orders, as they can show higher volatility than the rest of the areas. In these industries, the ticket prices are sufficiently high that the sample error alone could swing the presented figure significantly.</p>
<p>It is useful for investors not only in the nominal terms of order levels, but as a sign of business demand as a whole. Capital goods represent the higher-cost capital upgrades a company can make, and signals confidence in business conditions, which could lead to increased sales further up the supply chain and gains in hours worked and non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>Investors can play with the numbers here and look at things such as the rates of growth of inventories versus shipments; changes in the inventory/shipments ratio over time can point to either demand (falling ratio) or supply (rising ratio) imbalances in the economy.</p>


<p>Because capital goods take longer on average to manufacture than cyclical goods, new orders are often used by investors to gauge the likelihood of sales and earnings increases by the companies who make them. For instance, a company like Boeing could make revenue adjustments on the upside based on strong new order growth, signs of which could be gleaned from the <em>Durable Goods Report</em>. In addition, when production and capacity at <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">U.S.</place></country-region> manufacturers is rising, it helps to combat inflationary pressure, as more goods will be produced for consumer purchase.</p>
<p>Investors should be cautious to see through the high levels of volatility found in areas of the <em>Durable Goods Report</em>. Month-to-month changes should be compared with year-over-year figures and year-to-date estimates, looking for the overall trends that tend to define the business cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Good industry breakdowns    </li><li>Data provided raw and with seasonal adjustments    </li><li>Provides forward-looking data such as inventory levels and new business, which count toward future earnings. </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>The survey sample does not carry a statistical standard deviation to measure error.    </li><li>Highly volatile; moving averages should be used to identify long-term trends </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Durable Goods Report </em>gives more insight into the supply chain than most indicators, and can be especially useful in helping investors get a feel for earnings potential in the most represented industries: machinery, technology manufacturing and transportation.


<h2>Economic Indicators: Employee Cost Index (ECI)</h2>



<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>The last Thursday of April, July, November and January</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>8:30am Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Previous Quarter</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/eci.nr0.htm</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Employment Cost Index (ECI) is a quarterly report of compensation costs that is released in the final month of the quarter, with a cutoff date of payroll periods ending the twelfth of the month of the release. The ECI is an index-based indicator that presents the changes in wages, bonuses and benefits from the previous quarter, displayed on a per-hour basis. All non-farm industries are covered, with the exception of federal government employees (which only make up 2-3% of the work force). </p>
<p>The data is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and is broken down by industry group, occupation and union vs. non-union workers. The data is compiled through separate surveys of non-farm businesses (about 4,500 sampled) and state and local governments (about 1,000 sampled). The index has a base weighting of 100. The current base period is December 2005.</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>The ECI is watched primarily for its inflationary insights. Compensation costs represent the lion's share of the total cost for a company to produce a product or deliver a service in the marketplace (and can be computed per company by dividing cost of goods sold (COGS) by selling, general &amp; administrative expense (SG&amp;A) on the company's income statement). The relative percentages of COGS will vary by industry, making the data release valuable on an inter-industry level.</p>
<p>The ECI is used by the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy; as the Fed has publicly stated, it prefers the value of this release to the <em>Employment Situation</em> <em>Report's</em> hourly cost figures, which just include wages. Another benefit of the methodology used in the ECI is that wage changes that occur as a result of a shift in the occupational mix of workers can be captured here using a "basket of occupations" approach similar to that of the CPI. Results of the ECI are less likely to be affected by people shifting to lower or higher-paying jobs. </p>
<p>The ECI is a lagging indicator; rising costs at this level speak to economic overheating that has already been visible at earlier points in the economic food chain (commodity costs, retail sales, gross domestic product), and suggest that some rise in inflation is inevitable.</p>
<p>This indicator can move the markets if it shows marked differences from street estimates. Economists and Fed watchers are always on the lookout for surprise signs of inflation, and anything that changes the common perceptions on Wall Street as to the level of inflation will move the bond markets immediately, and stocks will react according to its recent performance relative to economic growth prospects. The deeper into the business cycle the economy is, the more likely it will be for stocks to sell off on fears of Fed rate cuts, and possibly the end of the growth phase within the current cycle. </p>
<p>Rising compensation costs are usually passed on to consumers because they are such a large corporate expense. </p>


<p>The ECI is used as part of the formula that calculates productivity. If productivity gains are less than proportional ECI gains, there won't be the necessary balance to keeping end prices to consumers down. Investors should always compare the ECI to total productivity figures, paying particular attention to relative rates within industries in which they have a stake. </p>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Employment Situation Report</em>, also known as the <em>Labor Report</em>, is an extremely broad-based indicator released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It is made up two separate and equally important surveys. The first, the "establishment survey", is a sampling of more than 400,000 businesses across the country. It is the most comprehensive labor report available, covering about one-third of all non-farm workers nationwide, and presents final statistics including non-farm payrolls, hours worked and hourly earnings. The data sample is both large and deep, with breakouts covering more than 500 industries and hundreds of metropolitan areas.   </p>
<p>The second survey, referred to as the "household survey", measures results from more than 60,000 households and produces a figure representing the total number of individuals out of work, and from that the national unemployment rate. The data is compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau with assistance from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This carries a census-like component, bringing demographic shifts into the mix, which gives the results a different perspective.</p>
<p>Both sets of survey results will show the change from the previous month, and also year-over-year, as trendlines are very important with this often volatile statistic.</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Employment Situation Report</em> is a multi-layered release, with many links from the main page and following the headline discussion items. Because there is so much information provided, it's important to identify the numbers that will be most watched.</p>
<p>The non-farm payrolls figure is very important on Wall Street; it's the benchmark labor statistic out there used to determine the health of the job market because of its large sample size and historical significance in relation to accurately predicting business cycles. Economists have settled on the number of 150,000 jobs as the level that defines economic growth. Gains of roughly 150,000 jobs or more indicate expansion of the labor force, while anything below indicates a weak job market. </p>
<p>The payroll figures from the establishment report are considered a coincident indicator.</p>
<p>Each survey comes up with its own figures for total employed persons using very different tacks. The establishment report  is larger, and theoretically more accurate, but excludes private households, the self-employed and the agricultural sector. The household report runs on a smaller sample and may be more subjective, but the inclusion of self-employed workers, for example, can make this figure more valuable in a time when many people are starting their own business (as often happens in the beginning of a new business cycle).</p>
<p>Average weekly hours for the manufacturing sector, as presented in the establishment report, is a leading indicator, and is represented in The Conference Board's U.S. Leading Index.</p>
<p>The unemployment figures from the household report (which is probably the most watched metric of the release after non-farm payrolls) are considered a lagging indicator, as people tend to be out of work when problems in the economy have already manifested themselves in falling economic output (less workers, less GDP). (For more insight, read <em>What are leading lagging and coincident indicators?</em>)</p>
<p>Investors study the labor report to look for trends indisposable income, wage inflation and employment statistics, many studying industries of personal interest to them. Analysts will usually conclude that if payrolls are increasing and wages are rising, that personal consumption stats like retail sales will advance as well, as more money will be in the pockets of consumers. </p>
<p>The Fed watches this report intensely. Alan Greenspan used up good a deal of his allotted minutes during all those years of Senate briefings talking about the labor markets, specifically information contained in the benchmark<em> Labor Report</em>. The unemployment rate alone makes up more than 47% of the lagging index created by the Conference Board and used by the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>In relation to the hourly employment costs, investors can be best served by using the figures here in conjunction with the <em>Employment Cost Index</em>, which comes out about a week after the <em>Labor Report</em> in the four months the ECI is released (ECI is a quarterly report). A key to look for is whether wages are keeping pace with inflation; if not, the real purchasing power of consumers will drop.</p>
<p>The household survey takes into account demographic changes to some degree, whereas the establishment survey only counts the total number of payrolls. In effect, the household survey acts as a mini-census, which is why the same employment report may show an increase in payrolls, while the unemployment rate simultaneously rises, a seeming contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>The number of hours worked data can shed light on where the economy is in the business cycle; companies will often stretch the hours of their current workforce before they decide to hire new workers. This conservative behavior likens to "testing the waters" of the economy before committing to hiring for future growth. </p>



<p>Investors can pore over the industry-specific numbers to get a good feel for labor trends within the industries investors have holdings in - there may be pockets of strength in an overall weak labor report.</p>
<p>Labor statistics can tell us a lot, but they do not necessarily define the economy. Many industries can be well positioned to remain profitable even during tough labor markets - financial services, for instance, can easily lay off workers and keep labor tight until conditions improve, while more capital-intensive industries such as manufacturing (with its higher fixed cost structure) may suffer bigger hits in profitability.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>As one of the most widely watched reports, the <em>Employment Situation Report</em> gets a lot of press and can move the markets.    </li><li>Summary analysis provided by the BLS (top link on the site) on the top-level release of an already detail-rich report    </li><li>Relates to investors on a personal level; everyone understands having a job or looking for work.    </li><li>Services industries are covered here - it is hard to find good indicator coverage of service-based businesses. </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>Summer and other seasonal employment tends to skew the results.    </li><li>Only measures whether people are working; it does not take into account whether these are jobs the people wish to have, or whether they are well-suited to workers' skills.    </li><li>Volatile; revisions can be quite large, and updates should always be viewed in the most recent report.    </li><li>Unemployment and payroll figures can seem to be out of alignment, as they are derived from two different surveys.    </li><li>Compensation costs portion is considered inferior to the <em>Employment Cost Index</em>. </li></ul></p>
<p><strong>The Closing Line</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Employment Situation Report</em> is a very powerful indicator that is able to move the markets dramatically if the results surprise Wall Street. Heavily analyzed, the report is the single best way to understand the state of the labor force at any point in time.


<h2>Economic Indicators: Existing Home Sales</h2>



<table><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Date:</strong></td><td>Fourth week of the month</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Release Time:</strong></td><td>8:30am Eastern Standard Time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Coverage:</strong></td><td>Previous month\'s closings</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Released By:</strong></td><td>National Association of Realtors</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Latest Release:</strong></td><td>http://www.realtor.org/research.nsf/pages/EHSdata</td></tr></table>

</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Existing Home Sales Report</em> is a monthly release covering the number of existing homes that were closed during the survey month along with average sales prices by geographic region. The "closed" distinction is important because most closing periods are anywhere from six to eight weeks, so values listed are likely to relate to sales made about two months prior. The data is collected and released by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>There are three important metrics in this report; in addition to the aggregate number of existing homes sold and median selling prices, inventory levels are provided through the "months supply" figure, a number that represents the length of time in months required to burn through all of the existing inventory measured during the period. </p>
<p>Data is provided raw and with seasonal adjustments. This is because weather is a big factor in determining month-to-month demand. As with the <em>Housing Starts</em><em> Report</em>, the data is also broken down by geographic region (Northeast, <place w:st="on">Midwest</place>, South and West). Price data will show percentage changes from the year-over-year period and the prior month.</p>
<p><strong>What it Means for Investors</strong></p>
<p>Whereas the <em>Housing Starts </em>release deals with construction levels and is therefore a supply-oriented housing indicator, existing sales are much more about aggregate demand among consumers. While not included in the Conference Board's U.S. Leading Index<em>,</em> existing home sales are considered a leading indicator as well because higher levels are typically reached when the economy is coming out of a recession. The inventory metric also points to how much slack exists in the housing market, as a high reading in the month supply figure means that prices could fall as inventory is worked down to more normalized levels. (For more insight, see <em>What are leading, lagging and coincident indicators? What are they for?</em>)</p>
<p>Besides business cycle considerations, prevailing mortgage rates are the biggest factors to consider when evaluating the sales levels. All else being equal, as rates rise, sales will fall as consumers wait for a more opportune time to purchase a home. If home sales are strong, other consumer industries may see an uptick in sales, such as home improvement retailers and retail mortgage lenders.</p>



<p>Because of the lag between when a sale is made and when closing occurs, the report is not as timely as the <em>Housing Starts Report</em>, but the sample size is larger and less likely to have large revisions. Also, condominium sales are included in this report, but not in the starts report.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Large sample size    </li><li>Together with housing starts provides a clear picture of the strength of the housing market.     </li><li>A key leading indicator and predicator of future consumer purchases such as home furnishings and insurance services.    </li><li>Shows the level of demand within housing market.    </li><li>Released before the <em>New Home Sales Report</em> in the given month    </li><li>Includes condo sales, which are not included in the <em>Housing Starts Report</em> </li></ul><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<p><ul type="disc"><li>No detailed information on types of homes, just median sales prices.    </li><li>Subject to large bouts of seasonality </li></ul><strong>The Closing Line</p>
<p></strong>The <em>Existing Home Sales Report </em>can be a good leading indicator during times of concern over the housing market in general, and is best used in conjunction with the <em>Housing Starts </em>report
