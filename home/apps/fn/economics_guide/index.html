<h2>absolute advantage</h2>
<p>This is the simplest yardstick of economic performance. If one person, firm or country can produce more of something with the same amount of effort and resources, they have an absolute advantage over other producers. Being the best at something does not mean that doing that thing is the best way to use your scarce economic resources. The question of what to specialise in – and how to maximise the benefits from international trade – is best decided according to <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small>. Both absolute and comparative advantage may change significantly over time.</p>

<h2>adaptive expectations</h2>
<p>A theory of how people form their views about the future that assumes they do so using past trends and the errors in their own earlier predictions. Contrast with <small>RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS</small>.</p>

<h2>advance market commitment (AMC)</h2>
<p>In February 2007, a new form of incentive for <small>INNOVATION</small> was launched by the <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> of the UK, Canada, Italy, Norway and Russia in <small>PUBLIC-PRIVATE</small> partnership with the charitable Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. They promised $1.5 billion to buy a vaccine to protect against pneumococcal disease which could potentially save the lives of 5.4 million children by 2030. The idea was that by guaranteeing there would be <small>DEMAND</small> for the vaccine, this advance market commitment (AMC) made it far more likely that the vaccine would be developed by one or more pharmaceutical companies. Without the AMC, which is a legally binding government-backed contract, those companies considered it too risky to devote (enough) money to developing the vaccine.</p>

<h2>adverse selection</h2>
<p>When you do business with people you would be better off avoiding this. It is one of two main sorts of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small> often associated with <small>INSURANCE</small>. The other is <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>. Adverse selection can be a problem when there is <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small> between the seller of insurance and the buyer; in particular, insurance will often not be profitable when buyers have better information about their <small>RISK</small> of claiming than does the seller. Ideally, insurance premiums should be set according to the risk of a randomly selected person in the insured slice of the population (55-year-old male smokers, say). In practice, this means the <small>AVERAGE</small> risk of that group.</p><p>When there is adverse selection, people who know they have a higher risk of claiming than the average of the group will buy the insurance, whereas those who have a below-average risk may decide it is too expensive to be worth buying. In this case, premiums set according to the average risk will not be sufficient to cover the claims that eventually arise, because among the people who have bought the policy more will have above-average risk than below-average risk. Putting up the premium will not solve this problem, for as the premium rises the insurance policy will become unattractive to more of the people who know they have a lower risk of claiming. One way to reduce adverse selection is to make the purchase of insurance compulsory, so that those for whom insurance priced for average risk is unattractive are not able to opt out.</p>

<h2>advertising</h2>
<p>Many <small>FIRMS</small> advertise their goods or <small>SERVICES</small>, but are they wasting economic resources? Some economists reckon that advertising merely manipulates consumer tastes and creates desires that would not otherwise exist. By increasing product differentiation and encouraging <small>BRAND</small> loyalty, advertising may make consumers less price-sensitive, moving the market further from <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> towards imperfect competition (see <small><a href="#name.406">MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION</a></small>) and increasing the ability of firms to charge more than <small>MARGINAL</small> cost. Heavy spending on advertising may also create a <small>BARRIER TO ENTRY</small>, as a firm entering the market would have to spend a lot on advertising too.</p><p>However, some economists argue that advertising is economically valuable because it increases the flow of <small>INFORMATION</small> in the economy and reduces the <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small> between the seller and the consumer. This intensifies competition, as consumers can be made aware quickly when there is a better deal on offer.</p>

<h2>agency costs</h2>
<p>These can arise when somebody (the principal) hires somebody else (the agent) to carry out a task and the interests of the agent conflict with the interests of the principal. An example of such principal-agent problems comes from the relationship between the shareholders who own a public company and the managers who run it. The owners would like the managers to run the firm in ways that maximise the value of their <small>SHARES</small>, whereas the managers’ priority may be, say, to build a business empire through rapid expansion and <small>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</small>, which may not increase their firm’s share <small>PRICE</small>.</p><p>One way to reduce agency costs is for the principal to monitor what the agent does to make sure it is what the agent has been hired to do. But this can be costly, too. It may be impossible to define the agent’s job in a way that can be monitored effectively. For instance, it is hard to know whether a manager who has expanded a firm through an acquisition that reduced its share price was pursuing his own empire-building interests or, say, was trying to maximise <small>SHAREHOLDER VALUE</small> but was unlucky.</p><p>Another way to lower agency costs, especially when monitoring is too expensive or too difficult, is to make the interests of the agent more like those of the principal. For instance, from the early 1990s, an increasingly popular way to minimise the agency costs arising from the separation of ownership and management of public companies was to pay managers partly with shares and share options in the company. This, it was hoped, would give the managers a powerful incentive to act in the interests of the owners by maximising shareholder value. But even this did not turn out to be a perfect solution. Unless the rules governing when shares and options are awarded or sold are set with great care, they can create new agency costs rather than eliminate them. Some managers with lots of share options have engaged in accounting fraud in order to increase the value of those options long enough for them to cash some of them in, but to the detriment of their firm and its other shareholders.</p><p>Economists largely agree that agency costs played a significant role in the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 because so much of the finance industry is built on managing other people’s money, but this is often done in ways that are not in the best long-term interests of those other people.</p>

<h2>agricultural policy</h2>
<p>Countries often provide support for their farmers using trade barriers and subsidy because, for example:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">domestic <small>AGRICULTURE</small>, even if it is inefficient by world standards, can be an <small>INSURANCE</small> policy in case it becomes difficult (as it does, for example, in wartime) to buy agricultural produce from abroad;</span></li><li><span class="black1">farmers’ groups have proved adept at lobbying;</span></li><li><span class="black1">politicians have sought to slow the depopulation of rural areas;</span></li><li><span class="black1">agricultural prices can be volatile, as a result of unpredictable weather, among other things;</span></li><li><span class="black1">financial support can provide a safety net in unexpectedly severe market conditions;</span></li><li><span class="black1">biofuels are seen as a desirable alternative to fossil fuels given the need to curb climate change.</span></li></ul><p>Broadly, <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> have tried two methods of subsidising agriculture. The first, used in the US during the 1930s and in the UK before it joined the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small>, is to top up farmers’ incomes if they fall below a level deemed acceptable. Farmers may be required to set aside some of their land in return for this support. The second is to guarantee minimum farm prices by buying up surplus <small>SUPPLY</small> and storing or destroying it if prices would otherwise fall below the guaranteed levels. This was the approach adopted by the EU when it set up its Common Agricultural Policy. To keep down the direct cost of this subsidy the EU used trade barriers, including import levies, to minimise <small>COMPETITION</small> to EU farmers from produce available more cheaply on world agriculture markets. More recent US farm-support policy has combined income top-ups and some guaranteed prices.</p><p>As most governments have become more committed to international trade, such agricultural policies have come under increasing attack, although the <small>FREE TRADE</small> rhetoric has often run far ahead of genuine reform. In 2012, the 21 biggest food-producing countries together spent $486 billion supporting their farmers, nearly twice as much as in 2006. Finding a way to end agricultural support had become by far the biggest remaining challenge for those trying to negotiate global free trade.</p><p>However, since the start of the new millennium, there have been periods of rapidly increasing food prices, with particularly painful consequences for poor consumers in <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>, where there have been growing numbers of food riots. Though some of these price rises were due to short-lived financial speculation, two longer-term trends have also been influential in driving up this “agflation”: rising prosperity in developing countries, which has led to greater <small>DEMAND</small> for meat (animals require more grain to produce a meal than if the diner simply ate grain), and farmers switching land from food to biofuel production. This has led to a renewed interest in finding ways to raise agricultural <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small>, perhaps through a new “green revolution” similar to that which saved an estimated billion lives (mostly) in Asia during the second half of the 20th century.</p>

<h2>agriculture</h2>
<p>Farming around the world continues to become more productive while generally accounting for a smaller share of employment and <small>NATIONAL INCOME</small>, although in some poor countries it remains the sector on which the country and its people depend. Farming, forestry and fishing in 1913 accounted for 28% of employment in the US, 41% in France and 60% in Japan, but only 12% in the UK. Now the proportion of the workforce employed in such activities has dropped to around 5% or less in these and most other industrialised countries.</p><p>The total value of international trade in agriculture has risen steadily. But the global agriculture market remains severely distorted by trade barriers and government <small>SUBSIDY</small>, such as the <small>EUROPEAN UNION’S</small> Common <small>AGRICULTURAL POLICY</small>. The rapid rise in recent years of the use of biofuels, often subsidised by governments, has further distorted agricultural markets, leading to significantly higher food prices.</p>

<h2>altruism</h2>
<p>It is often alleged that altruism is inconsistent with economic rationality, which assumes that people behave selfishly. Certainly, much economic analysis is concerned with how individuals behave, and <i>Homo economicus</i> (<small>ECONOMIC MAN</small>) is usually assumed to act in his or her self-interest. However, self-interested does not necessarily mean selfish. Some economic models in the fields of <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small> and <small>NEUROECONOMICS</small> assume that self-interested individuals behave altruistically because they get some benefit, or <small>UTILITY</small>, from doing so. For instance, it may make them feel better about themselves, or be a useful <small>INSURANCE</small> policy against social unrest, say. Some economic models go further and relax the traditional assumption of fully rational behaviour by simply assuming that people sometimes behave altruistically, even if this may be against their self-interest. Either way, there is much economic literature about <small>CHARITY, INTERNATIONAL AID, PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and redistributive <small>TAXATION</small>.</p>

<h2>antitrust</h2>
<p>Government policy for dealing with <small>MONOPOLY</small>. Antitrust laws aim to stop abuses of <small>MARKET POWER</small> by big companies and, sometimes, to prevent corporate <small>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</small> that would create or strengthen a monopolist. There have been big differences in antitrust policies both among countries and within the same country over time. This has reflected different ideas about what constitutes a monopoly and, where there is one, what sorts of behaviour are abusive.</p><p>In the US, monopoly policy has been built on the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. This prohibited contracts or conspiracies to restrain trade or, in the words of a later act, to monopolise commerce. In the early 20th century this law was used to reduce the economic power wielded by so-called “robber barons”, such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, who dominated much of US industry through huge trusts that controlled companies’ voting shares. Du Pont chemicals, the railroad companies and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, among others, were broken up. In the 1970s the Sherman Act was turned (ultimately without success) against IBM, and in 1982 it secured the break-up of AT&amp;T’s nationwide telecoms monopoly.</p><p>In the 1980s, a more <small>LAISSEZ-FAIRE</small> approach was adopted, underpinned by economic theories from the <small>CHICAGO SCHOOL</small>. These theories said that the only justification for antitrust intervention should be that a lack of <small>COMPETITION</small> harmed consumers, and not that a firm had become, in some ill-defined sense, too big. Some monopolistic activities previously targeted by antitrust authorities, such as <small>PREDATORY PRICING</small> and exclusive marketing agreements, were much less harmful to consumers than had been thought in the past. They also criticised the traditional method of identifying a monopoly, which was based on looking at what percentage of a market was served by the biggest firm or <small>FIRMS</small>, using a measure known as the <small>HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX</small>. Instead, they argued that even a market dominated by one firm need not be a matter of antitrust concern, provided it was a <small>CONTESTABLE MARKET</small>.</p><p>In the 1990s, US antitrust policy became somewhat more interventionist. A high-profile lawsuit was launched against Microsoft in 1998. The giant software company was found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour, which was said to slow the pace of <small>INNOVATION</small>. However, fears that the firm would be broken up, signalling a far more interventionist US antitrust policy, proved misplaced. Microsoft was not severely punished. More recently, antitrust policy has, particularly in Europe, focused on the growing market power of big internet firms such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>In the UK, antitrust policy was long judged according to what policymakers decided was in the public interest. At times this approach was comparatively permissive of mergers and acquisitions; at others it was less so. However, in the mid-1980s the UK followed the US lead in basing antitrust policy on whether changes in competition harmed consumers. Within the rest of the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> several big countries pursued policies of building up national champions, allowing chosen firms to enjoy some monopoly power at home which could be used to make them more effective competitors abroad. Only during the 1990s did the European Commission become increasingly active in antitrust policy, mostly seeking to promote competition within the EU.</p><p>In 2000, the EU controversially blocked a merger between two US firms, GE and Honeywell; the deal had already been approved by US antitrust regulators. Subsequently, it also levied large fines on Microsoft, which some economists said reflected a more stringent definition of antitrust than that of the US. These controversies highlighted an important issue. As <small>GLOBALISATION</small> increases, the relevant market for judging whether market power exists or is being abused will increasingly cover far more territory than any one single economy. Indeed, there may be a need to establish a global antitrust watchdog, perhaps under the auspices of the <small>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</small>.</p>

<h2>arbitrage</h2>
<p>Buying an <small>ASSET</small> in one market and simultaneously selling an identical asset at a higher <small>PRICE</small>. Sometimes these will be identical assets in different markets, for instance <small>SHARES</small> in a company listed on both the London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Often the assets being arbitraged will be identical in a more complicated way; for example, they will be different sorts of financial securities that are each exposed to identical <small>RISKS</small>. According to the <small>EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS</small>, arbitrage is possible only when there is inefficiency in the market – and arbitrage is a process that makes markets more efficient.</p><p>Some kinds of arbitrage are completely risk-free – this is pure arbitrage. For instance, if <small>EUROS</small> are available more cheaply in dollars in London than in New York, arbitrageurs (also known as arbs) can make a risk-free <small>PROFIT</small> by buying euros in London and selling an identical amount of them in New York. Opportunities for pure arbitrage have become rare in recent years, partly because of the <small>GLOBALISATION</small> of financial markets. Among other things, this has reduced opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, which takes advantage of differences in financial regulations between countries. Today, most of what is called arbitrage, much of it done by <small>HEDGE FUNDS</small>, involves assets that have some similarities but are not identical. This is not pure arbitrage and, on occasions, it can be extremely risky.</p>

<h2>asymmetric information</h2>
<p>When somebody knows more than somebody else. Such asymmetric information can make it difficult for the two people to do business together, which is why economists, especially those practising <small>GAME THEORY</small>, are interested in it. Transactions involving asymmetric (or private) information are everywhere. A <small>GOVERNMENT</small> selling broadcasting licences does not know what buyers are prepared to pay for them; a lender does not know how likely a borrower is to repay; a used-car seller knows more about the quality of the car being sold than do potential buyers. This kind of asymmetry can distort people’s incentives and result in significant inefficiencies, including widespread deception and the manipulation of markets.</p>

<h2>asymmetric shock</h2>
<p>When something unexpected happens that affects one economy (or part of an economy) more than the rest. This can create big problems for policymakers if they are trying to set a <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> that works for both the area affected by the <small>SHOCK</small> and the unaffected area. For instance, some economic areas may be <small>OIL</small> exporters and thus highly dependent on the <small>PRICE</small> of oil, but other areas are not. If the oil price plunges, the oil-dependent area would benefit from policies designed to boost <small>DEMAND</small> that might be unsuited to the needs of the rest of the economy. As the years since the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 have highlighted, this is a problem for those responsible for setting the <small>INTEREST RATE</small> for the <small>EURO</small> because of the big differences – and different potential exposures to shocks – among the economies within the <small>EURO ZONE</small>.</p>

<h2>auctions</h2>
<p>Going, going, gone. Holding an auction can be an extremely efficient way for a seller to set the <small>PRICE</small> of its products, especially if it does not have much <small>INFORMATION</small> about how much people may be willing to pay for them. Auctions fascinate economists, especially those who specialise in <small>GAME THEORY</small>. They have long been a feature of the sale of art and antiques by <small>FIRMS</small> such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s. But they have played a growing role in other parts of the economy, ranging from the allocation of government-controlled broadcasting bandwidth to the awarding of work to subcontractors by <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> and big firms using competitive tendering, and more recently the sale of goods over the internet.</p><p>An English auction is the most familiar. Bidders compete to offer higher prices and drop out until only one remains. In a Dutch auction, the auctioneer calls out a high price then keeps lowering it until there is a buyer. There are various forms of sealed-bid auctions. In a first-price sealed bid, each buyer submits a price in a sealed envelope and all bids are opened simultaneously, with the highest offer winning.</p><p>In a second-price Vickrey auction, named after Nobel Prize-winning economist William Vickrey, bidders submit sealed bids without knowing the bids of others in the auction. The highest bidder wins, but only pays the amount of the second-highest bid. This gives bidders an incentive to bid the true value of the goods.</p><p>An English, Dutch or Vickrey auction will work well for a seller if there is more than one serious bidder, as <small>COMPETITION</small> will ensure that the price is set at the level at which it is not worth more to any other bidder but the winner. Indeed, in a competitive auction the successful bidder may end up offering more than what is being auctioned is actually worth. This is known as the <small>WINNER’S CURSE</small>.</p><p>Which method will generate the best price for the seller depends on how many bidders take part and how well informed they are. Unfortunately for the seller, this information is not always available before the auction takes place.</p>

<p>Measures taken by <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> to reduce expenditure in an attempt to shrink their growing <small>BUDGET DEFICITS</small>. In the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, several governments, including the UK’s, loudly embraced austerity policies in the belief that they had to be seen to reduce public <small>DEBT</small> in order to retain the confidence of the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>, which had become nervous about the sustainability of heavily indebted governments (such as those of Ireland and Greece). This was in sharp contrast to the advice of <small>KEYNESIAN</small> economists, who advocated fiscal stimulus at a time of deep <small>RECESSION</small>. As the UK, which adopted austerity, and the US, which did not, both recovered relatively well after the Great Recession, there remains much debate among economists over whether or not, or in what circumstances, austerity measures make sense.</p>

<h2>Austrian economics</h2>
<p>A brand of <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> established in Vienna during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.

Prominent members included Friedrich <small>HAYEK</small> and Ludwig von Mises. It gave birth to the definition of economics as the science of studying human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses. Austrian economic thinking was characterised by attributing all economic activity, including the behaviour of apparently impersonal institutions, to the wishes and actions of individuals. It did this by examining choices in terms of their <small>OPPORTUNITY COST</small> (that is, what is the next-best use of resources to that which is being considered?) and by analysing the impact of timing on decision-making.</p><p>Hayek correctly predicted the failure of Soviet-style central planning.

But a country can often sustain a current-account <small>DEFICIT</small> for many years without its economy suffering, because any deficit is likely to be tiny compared with the country’s <small>NATIONAL INCOME</small> and wealth. Indeed, if the deficit is caused by firms importing technology and other capital goods from abroad, which will improve their <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small>, the economy may benefit. A deficit that has to be financed by the public sector may be more problematic, particularly if the public sector faces limits on how much it can raise taxes or borrow or has few financial <small>RESERVES</small>. For instance, when the Russian government failed to pay the interest on its foreign debt in August 1998 it found it impossible to borrow any more money in the international <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>. Nor was it able to increase taxes in its collapsing economy or to find anybody within Russia willing to lend it money. That truly was a balance of payments crisis.</p><p>In the early years of the 21st century, the US current-account deficit grew to over 5% of the country’s <small>GDP</small>, making its economy increasingly (and, to some economists, worryingly) reliant on foreign credit, particularly from China.</p>

<h2>balanced budget</h2>

For instance, if the <small>DEBT</small> is used to invest in things that will increase the <small>GROWTH</small> rate of the economy – <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>, say, or education – it may be justified, especially because a government can typically borrow more cheaply than other borrowers.

<h2>bank</h2>
<p>Starting out as places that would guard your <small>MONEY</small>, banks became the main source of <small>CREDIT CREATION</small>. From the 1980s onwards, borrowers increasingly turned for loans to the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> and to non-savings institutions, such as credit-card companies and consumer-finance <small>FIRMS</small>. This reduced the profitability of traditional bank lending and led many banks to enter new areas of business, such as selling <small>INSURANCE</small> policies and mutual funds. Traditional banks also began to sell parcels of their loans in the financial markets by a process called <small>SECURITISATION</small>. This process broke down dramatically in the summer of 2007, as a <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> hit both the banking system and the financial markets, with severe consequences for the global economy.</p><p>What the most efficient split is between bank lending and other sorts of lending was debatable even before the credit crunch. Economists argued endlessly about whether an economy such as the US, in which firms have relied more heavily on the <small>EQUITY</small> and <small>DEBT</small> markets than on banks to fund their <small>INVESTMENT</small>, functions better than one such as Germany, in which banks have traditionally been the main source of corporate finance.</p><p>Banks come in many different forms. Commercial banks, also known as retail banks, cater directly for the general public and lend to (mostly small and medium-sized) firms. In the past, they did so largely through a network of bank branches, although increasingly these are giving way to a combination of ATMs and smartphone apps. Wholesale banks largely transact with other banks and financial institutions. Investment banks, also known as merchant banks, concentrate on raising money for companies from private investors or in the financial markets, by finding buyers for their equity and corporate <small>BONDS</small>. Universal banks do most or all of the above including bancassurance (that is, using the banks’ distribution channels to sell insurance). These banks have long been a feature of continental European economies. However, in the US financial laws such as the Glass-Steagall Act separated different forms of banking from each other and kept banks out of the insurance business. These laws were abolished in 1999, although during the preceding couple of decades regulators effectively dismantled them by changing the way they were applied. This triggered a faster consolidation of the industry. Even so, because of these and other laws, which for many years stopped banks from operating across state borders, the US has far more lending institutions than other countries. In 2015, there were over 5,300 banks in the US (down from over 8,000 in 2000), compared with fewer than 1,800 in Germany, 700 in Italy and 600 in France.</p><p>The <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> that began in 2007, followed by the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>, was associated with widespread distress in the banking system. Many banks failed, or came close to failure, and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> in many countries intervened in an attempt to stabilise the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>. Billions of dollars were pumped into banks to help them achieve the <small>CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO</small> required by regulators. Leading investment banks became commercial banks, accepting closer oversight in exchange for additional government support. In several countries, including the US and the UK, governments acquired shares in leading banks, at least temporarily, and introduced far heavier <small>REGULATION</small> of bank activities. One immediate impact of the new regulations was to drive large amounts of <small>RISK</small>-taking out of banks and into the so-called <small>SHADOW BANKING</small> sector, where it was subject to far less regulatory oversight. The full consequences of this dramatic change are unlikely to be clear for many years.</p>

<h2>bankruptcy</h2>
<p>When a court judges that a debtor is unable to make the payments owed to a <small>CREDITOR</small>. How bankrupts are treated can affect economic <small>GROWTH</small>. If bankrupts are punished too severely, would-be <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small> may be discouraged from taking the financial risks needed to make the most of their ideas. That is why limited liability is a crucial element of modern <small>CAPITALISM</small>. However, letting off defaulting debtors too readily may discourage potential creditors because of <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>.</p><p>The US bankruptcy code, in particular Chapter 11 protection for <small>FIRMS</small> from their creditors, is friendly to troubled borrowers, allowing them to borrow more money and giving them time to work out their problems. Some other countries quickly close down a bankrupt firm, and try to repay its <small>DEBTS</small> by selling off any <small>ASSETS</small> it has.</p>

<h2>Basel 1, 2 and 3</h2>
<p>A series of attempts to reduce the number of <small>BANK</small> failures by tying a bank’s <small>CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO</small> to the riskiness of the loans it makes. For instance, there is less chance of a loan to a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> going bad than a loan to, say, a start-up business, so the bank should not have to hold as much <small>CAPITAL</small> in reserve against the first loan as against the second. The first attempt to do this worldwide was by the Basel committee for international banking supervision in 1988. However, its system of judging the relative riskiness of different loans was crude. For instance, it penalised banks no more for making loans to a fly-by-night software company in Thailand than to Microsoft; or to South Korea, bailed out by the IMF in 1998, than to Switzerland. In 1998, “Basel 2” was proposed, using much more sophisticated <small>RISK</small> classifications. However, controversy over these new classifications, and the cost to banks of administering the new approach, led to several delays to the introduction of Basel 2. Following the widespread bank failures around the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, “Basel 3” was introduced, adding further measures to increase bank capital relative to its lending, and to ensure that the banking system is sufficiently liquid in a crisis. Yet again, the pace of adoption of the new rules around the world has been slower and more piecemeal than the governments agreeing to them had indicated.</p>

<h2>behavioural economics</h2>
<p>A branch of <small>ECONOMICS</small> that concentrates on explaining the economic decisions people make in practice, especially when these conflict with what conventional economic theory predicts they will do. Behaviourists try to augment or replace traditional ideas of economic rationality <i>(Homo economicus)</i> with decision-making models borrowed from psychology. According to psychologists, people are disproportionately influenced by a fear of feeling regret and will often forgo benefits even to avoid only a small risk of feeling they have failed. They are also prone to cognitive dissonance, often holding on to a belief plainly at odds with new evidence, usually because the belief has been held and cherished for a long time. Then there is anchoring: people are often overly influenced by outside suggestion. People apparently also suffer from status quo bias: they are willing to take bigger gambles to maintain the status quo than they would be to acquire it in the first place. They are also prone to procrastination.</p><p>Traditional <small>UTILITY</small> theory assumes that people make individual decisions in the context of the big picture. But psychologists have found that they generally compartmentalise, often on superficial grounds. They then make choices about things in one particular mental compartment without taking account of the implications for things in other compartments.</p><p>There is lots of evidence that people are persistently and irrationally overconfident. They are also vulnerable to hindsight bias: once something happens they overestimate the extent to which they could have predicted it. Many of these traits are captured in <small>PROSPECT THEORY</small>, which is at the heart of much of behavioural economics.</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in how individual biases in behaviour aggregate into the mass irrationality of <small>CROWDS</small>, including the formation of financial <small>BUBBLES</small>. And <small>GOVERNMENTS</small>, including in the US and the UK, are using behavioural economics to design policies that <small>NUDGE</small> people to behave better (by, for instance, eating more healthily or paying more of the tax for which they are liable).</p>

<h2>beta</h2>
<p>Part of an economic theory for valuing financial <small>SECURITIES</small> and calculating the <small>COST OF CAPITAL</small>, known as the <small>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL</small>, beta measures the sensitivity of the <small>PRICE</small> of a particular <small>ASSET</small> to changes in the market as a whole. If a company’s <small>SHARES</small> have a beta of 0.8, it implies that on average the share price will change by 0.8% if there is a 1% change in the market. There is a long-running debate about whether a beta calculated from a security’s past relationship with the market actually predicts how that relationship will behave in future, leading some doubting economists to claim that beta is “dead”.</p>

<h2>Big Mac index</h2>
<p>Devised by Pam Woodall of <i>The Economist</i> in 1986 as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. The Big Mac index is based on one of the oldest concepts in international <small>ECONOMICS, PURCHASING POWER PARITY</small> (PPP): the notion that a dollar, say, should buy the same amount in all countries. In the <small>LONG RUN</small>, argue PPP fans, currencies should move towards the <small>EXCHANGE RATE</small> which equalises the <small>PRICES</small> of an identical basket of goods and <small>SERVICES</small> in each country. In this case, the basket is a McDonald’s Big Mac, which is produced in more than 100 countries. The Big Mac PPP is the exchange rate that would mean hamburgers cost the same in the US as elsewhere. Comparing actual exchange rates with the Big Mac rate indicates whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued. Even though serious economists point out that too many of the things that go into making a Big Mac are non-tradeable for international differences in its price to be a good guide to PPP, several studies have found that the Big Mac index is often a better predictor of currency movements than more theoretically rigorous models.</p>

<h2>bitcoin</h2>
<p>A digital currency (cryptocurrency) and <small>ASSET</small> invented in a manifesto published online in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has been shrouded in mystery. Much of its initial use was to pay for illegal activity on the “dark” internet, including drug-dealing and prostitution, though it has since become a somewhat more respectable part of the mainstream economy – while failing to displace established fiat currencies issued by national <small>GOVERNMENTS</small>. Bitcoins are created through a process known as digital mining, in which speculators compete by crunching large amounts of data to solve mathematical challenges.</p><p>Speculative activity caused the value of bitcoin to rise and fall wildly in its early years, from a starting value of $0.30 to an all-time high of $1,242 in November 2013, then back down to a low of $224 in early 2015. Such volatility discouraged broad adoption as a mainstream alternative to fiat <small>MONEY</small>. There has been growing interest in the revolutionary potential of the software underlying bitcoin, known as blockchain, which admirers think could underpin a better digital <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> by allowing for cheap, riskless transactions to replace many which currently involve paying significant fees to trusted intermediaries, such as <small>BANKS</small> and stock exchanges. There are also theories that blockchain could play a big role in democratising how the internet economy is governed.</p>

<p>If you engage in illegal activity, the value of that trade does not show up in your country’s <small>GDP</small> data.

In the US and the UK, the black economy adds an estimated 5–10% to GDP; in Italy, it may add 30%. As for Russia, in the late 1990s estimates of the black economy ranged as high as 50% of GDP. If an economic activity is simply unmonitored or unacknowledged by a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> (it is not subject to tax, for example), it may be part of the “grey” or “informal” economy. The informal economy can be huge, accounting for an estimated half or more of economic activity in some <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>.</p>

<h2>black swan</h2>
<p>A high-impact event, hard to predict and rare. It was long assumed that swans are inevitably white, and thus a black swan was a metaphor for something that could not exist. Then black swans were discovered in Australia in the 17th century, and the black swan came to represent an occurrence of the unexpected. This idea was popularised by mathematician Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2006 book <i>The Black Swan.</i> He describes as black swans such things as the rise of the internet and the personal computer, the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11th 2001, and the fact that the losses suffered by <small>BANKS</small> in the period around the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 were far greater than their <small>RISK</small> models predicted. He argued that most people prefer to ignore the possibility of black swans, as they like to believe the universe is orderly and predictable. He is especially critical of this sort of thinking by those economists responsible for modern finance theory, such as the <small>EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS</small>, which has underpinned the rapid growth in the market for <small>DERIVATIVES</small>. Critics have argued that “black swan” is too imprecise a concept to be of any practical use.</p>

Like shares in listed companies, once they have been issued bonds may be traded on the open market. A bond’s <small>YIELD</small> is the <small>INTEREST RATE</small> (or coupon) paid on the bond divided by the bond’s market <small>PRICE</small>. Bonds are regarded as a lower-risk <small>INVESTMENT</small>. Government bonds, in particular, are highly unlikely to miss their promised payments. Corporate bonds typically come with different <small>RATINGS</small>, reflecting their different <small>RISK</small>. Those issued by blue-chip companies, rated as “investment grade”, are unlikely to default; this might not be the case with high-yield “junk” bonds issued by <small>FIRMS</small> with less healthy financials.

<h2>Bretton Woods</h2>
<p>A conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, which designed the structure of the international monetary system after the second world war and set up the <small>IMF</small> and the <small>WORLD BANK</small>.

Such behaviour is a feature of all bubbles.</p><p>Famous bubbles include tulip mania in Holland during the 17th century, when the prices of tulip bulbs reached unheard-of levels, and the South Sea Bubble in Britain a century later, although there have been many others since, including the dotcom bubble in internet company <small>SHARES</small> that burst in 2000, and the bubble in <small>HOUSE PRICES</small> which, when it burst in 2007, helped to trigger a <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small>.</p><p>Economists argue about whether bubbles are the result of the irrational behaviour of <small>CROWDS</small> (perhaps coupled with exploitation of the gullible masses by some savvy speculators) or, instead, are the result of rational decisions by people who have only limited <small>INFORMATION</small> about the fundamental value of an asset and thus for whom it may be quite sensible to assume the market price is sound.

<p>An annual procedure to decide how much <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> there should be in the year ahead and what mix of <small>TAXATION</small>, charging for <small>SERVICES</small> and borrowing should finance it. The budgeting process differs enormously from one country to another. In the US, for example, the president proposes a budget in February for the fiscal year starting the following October, but this has to be approved by Congress. By the time a final decision has to be made, ideally no later than September, there are often three competing versions: the president’s latest proposal, one from the Senate and another from the House of Representatives. What finally emerges is the result of last-minute negotiations. Occasionally, delays in agreeing the budget have led to the temporary closure of some federal <small>GOVERNMENT</small> offices. Contrast this with the UK, where most of what the government proposes is usually approved by Parliament, and some changes take effect as soon as they are announced (subject to subsequent parliamentary vote).</p>

Since the second world war, however, expansions have lasted almost twice as long, an average of 50 months, and contractions have shortened to an average of only 11 months. Over the years, economists have produced numerous theories of why economic activity fluctuates so much, none of them particularly convincing. A Kitchin cycle supposedly lasted 39 months and was caused by fluctuations in companies’ inventories. The Juglar cycle would last 8–9 years as a result of changes in <small>INVESTMENT</small> in plant and machinery.

Taking a quite different tack, in the late 1960s Arthur Okun, an economic adviser to presidents Kennedy and Johnson, proclaimed that the business cycle was “obsolete”. A year later, the US economy was in recession. Again, in the late 1990s, some economists claimed that technological <small>INNOVATION</small> and <small>GLOBALISATION</small> meant that the business cycle was a thing of the past. Alas, they were soon proved wrong.</p>

<h2>cannibalise</h2>
<p>Eating people is wrong. Eating your own business may not be. <small>FIRMS</small> used to be reluctant to launch new products and <small>SERVICES</small> that competed with what they were already doing, as the new thing would eat into (cannibalise) their existing business. In today’s innovative, technology-intensive economy, however, a willingness to cannibalise is more often seen as a good thing. This is because <small>INNOVATION</small> often takes the form of what economists call creative destruction (see <small><a href="#name.586">SCHUMPETER</a></small>), in which a superior new product destroys the market for existing products. In this environment, the best course of action for successful firms that want to avoid losing their market to a rival with an innovation may be to carry out the creative destruction themselves.</p>

<h2>capacity</h2>
<p>The amount a company or an economy can produce using its current equipment, workers, <small>CAPITAL</small> and other resources at full tilt. Judging how close an economy is to operating at full capacity is an important ingredient of <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>, for if there is not enough spare capacity to absorb an increase in <small>DEMAND, PRICES</small> are likely to rise instead. Measuring an economy’s <small>OUTPUT GAP</small> – how far current output is above or below what it would be at full capacity – is difficult, if not impossible, which is why even the best-intentioned <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> can struggle to keep down <small>INFLATION</small>. When there is too much spare capacity, however, the result can be <small>DEFLATION</small>, as <small>FIRMS</small> and employees cut their prices and wage demands to compete for whatever demand there may be.</p>

<h2>capital</h2>
<p><small>MONEY</small> or <small>ASSETS</small> put to economic use, the life-blood of <small>CAPITALISM</small>. Economists describe capital as one of the four essential ingredients of economic activity, the factors of production, along with <small>LAND, LABOUR</small> and <small>ENTERPRISE</small>. Production processes that use a lot of capital relative to labour are <small>CAPITAL-INTENSIVE</small>; those that use comparatively little capital are <small>LABOUR-INTENSIVE</small>. Capital takes different forms. A firm’s assets are known as its capital, which may include fixed capital (machinery, buildings, and so on) and working capital (stocks of raw materials and part-finished products, as well as money, that are used up quickly in the production process). Financial capital includes money, <small>BONDS</small> and <small>SHARES. HUMAN CAPITAL</small> is the economic wealth or potential contained in a person, some of it endowed at birth, the rest the product of training and education, if only in the university of life. The invisible glue of relationships and institutions that holds an economy together is its <small>SOCIAL CAPITAL</small>.</p>

<h2>capital adequacy ratio</h2>
<p>The ratio of a <small>BANK’S CAPITAL</small> to its total <small>ASSETS</small>, required by regulators to be above a minimum (“adequate”) level so that there is little <small>RISK</small> of the bank going bust. How high this minimum level is may vary according to how risky a bank’s activities are. (See <small><a href="#name.037">BASEL 1, 2 AND 3</a></small>.)</p>

<h2>capital asset pricing model (CAPM)</h2>
<p>A method of valuing <small>ASSETS</small> and calculating the <small>COST OF CAPITAL</small> (for an alternative, see <small><a href="#name.017">ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY</a></small>). The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) has come to dominate modern finance.</p><p>The rationale of the CAPM can be simplified as follows. Investors can eliminate some sorts of <small>RISK</small>, known as <small>RESIDUAL RISK</small> or alpha, by holding a diversified portfolio of assets (see <small><a href="#name.398">MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY</a></small>). These alpha risks are specific to an individual asset, for example the risk that a company’s managers will turn out to be no good. Some risks, such as that of a global <small>RECESSION</small>, cannot be eliminated through diversification. So even a basket of all of the <small>SHARES</small> in a stockmarket will still be risky. People must be rewarded for investing in such a risky basket by earning <small>RETURNS</small> on <small>AVERAGE</small> above those that they can get on safer assets, such as <small>TREASURY BILLS</small>. Assuming investors diversify away alpha risks, how they value any particular asset should depend crucially on how much the asset’s <small>PRICE</small> is affected by the risk of the market as a whole. The market’s risk contribution is captured by a measure of relative <small>VOLATILITY, BETA</small>, which indicates how much an asset’s price is expected to change when the overall market changes.</p><p>Safe investments have a beta close to zero; economists call these assets risk-free. Riskier investments, such as <small>SHARES</small>, should earn a premium over the risk-free rate. How much is calculated by the average premium for all assets of that type, multiplied by the particular asset’s beta.</p><p>But does the CAPM work? It all comes down to beta, which some economists have found of dubious use. They think the CAPM may be an elegant theory that is no good in practice. Yet it is the most widely used method for calculating the cost of capital.</p>

<h2>capital controls</h2>
<p><small>GOVERNMENT</small>-imposed restrictions on the ability of <small>CAPITAL</small> to move in or out of a country. Examples include limits on foreign <small>INVESTMENT</small> in a country, on direct investment by foreigners in businesses or property, and on domestic residents’ investments abroad. Until the 20th century capital controls were uncommon, but many countries then imposed them. Following the end of the second world war only Switzerland, Canada and the US adopted open capital regimes. Other rich countries maintained strict controls and many made them tougher during the 1960s and 1970s. This changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when most developed countries scrapped their capital controls.</p><p>The pattern was more mixed in <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>. Latin American countries imposed lots of them during the <small>DEBT</small> crisis of the 1980s then scrapped most of them from the late 1980s onwards. Asian countries began to loosen their widespread capital controls in the 1980s and did so more rapidly during the 1990s.</p><p>In developed countries, there were two main reasons why capital controls were lifted: free markets became more fashionable and financiers became adept at finding ways around the controls. Developing countries later discovered that foreign capital could play a part in financing domestic investment, from roads in Thailand to telecoms systems in Mexico, and, furthermore, that financial capital often brought with it valuable <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>. They also found that capital controls did not work and had unwanted side-effects. Latin America’s controls in the 1980s failed to keep much <small>MONEY</small> at home and also deterred foreign investment.</p><p>The Asian crisis and <small>CAPITAL FLIGHT</small> of the late 1990s revived interest in capital controls, as some Asian governments wondered whether lifting the controls had left them vulnerable to the whims of international speculators, whose money could flow out of a country as fast as it once flowed in, creating economic instability. Argentina moved aggressively to control capital flows in ways that made foreigners reluctant to invest there. There was also discussion of a “Tobin tax” on short-term capital movements, proposed by James <small>TOBIN</small>, a winner of the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>. Even so, they mostly considered only limited controls on short-term capital movements, particularly movements out of a country, and did not reverse the broader 20-year-old process of global financial and economic <small>LIBERALISATION</small>. However, the global economic crisis following the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 prompted some countries to consider a change of direction that potentially would reverse some aspects of <small>GLOBALISATION</small> and liberalisation.</p>

<h2>capital flight</h2>
<p>When <small>CAPITAL</small> flows rapidly out of a country, usually because something happens that causes investors suddenly to lose confidence in its economy. (Strictly speaking, the problem is not so much the <small>MONEY</small> leaving, but rather that investors in general suddenly lower their valuation of all the country’s <small>ASSETS</small>.) This is particularly worrying when the flight capital belongs to the country’s own citizens. This is often associated with a sharp fall in the <small>EXCHANGE RATE</small> of the abandoned country’s currency.</p>

<h2>capital gains</h2>
<p>The <small>PROFIT</small> from the sale of a <small>CAPITAL ASSET</small>, such as a <small>SHARE</small> or a property. Capital gains are subject to <small>TAXATION</small> in most countries. Some economists argue that capital gains should be taxed lightly (if at all) compared with other sources of <small>INCOME</small>. They argue that the less tax is levied on capital gains, the greater is the incentive to put capital to productive use. Put another way, capital gains tax is effectively a tax on <small>CAPITALISM</small>. However, if capital gains are given too friendly a treatment by the tax authorities, accountants will no doubt invent all sorts of creative ways to disguise other income as capital gains.</p>

<h2>capital structure</h2>
<p>The composition of a company’s mixture of <small>DEBT</small> and <small>EQUITY</small> financing. A company’s debt/equity ratio is often referred to as its <small>GEARING</small>. Taking on more debt is known as gearing up, or increasing leverage. In the 1960s, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (1923–2000) published a series of articles arguing that it did not matter whether a company financed its activities by issuing debt, or equity, or a mixture of the two. (For this they were awarded the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>.) But, they said, this rule does not apply if one source of financing is treated more favourably by the taxman than another. In the US, debt has long had tax advantages over equity, so their theory implies that US <small>FIRMS</small> should finance themselves with debt. Companies also finance themselves by using the <small>PROFIT</small> they retain after paying <small>DIVIDENDS</small>.</p>

<h2>capitalism</h2>
<p>The winner, at least for now, of the battle of economic “isms” – although it was badly bruised by the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>. Capitalism is a free-market system built on private ownership, in particular the idea that owners of <small>CAPITAL</small> have <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small> that entitle them to earn a <small>PROFIT</small> as a reward for putting their capital at <small>RISK</small> in some form of economic activity. Opinion (and practice) differs considerably among capitalist countries about what role the state should play in the economy. But everyone agrees that, at the very least, for capitalism to work the state must be strong enough to guarantee property rights. According to Karl <small>MARX</small>, capitalism contains the seeds of its own destruction, but so far this has proved a more accurate description of Marx’s progeny, <small>COMMUNISM</small>.</p><p>Until recently, it had come to be believed that capitalism functioned best when associated with democracy, but as China started to grow fast by embracing capitalism without democracy some economists argued that its “authoritarian capitalism” could work better than the democratic alternative. By contrast, they said, India’s democracy may have hindered the development of its capitalism by overly restricting the ability of business people to act.</p>

<h2>cartel</h2>

Identifying and breaking up cartels is an important part of the competition policy overseen by <small>ANTITRUST</small> watchdogs in most countries, although proving the existence of a cartel is rarely easy, as firms are usually not so careless as to put agreements to collude on paper. The desire to form cartels is strong. As Adam <small>SMITH</small> put it:</p><p><i>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices.</i></p>

<h2>catch-up effect</h2>
<p>In any period, the economies of countries that start off poor generally grow faster than the economies of countries that start off rich. As a result, the <small>NATIONAL INCOME</small> of poor countries usually catches up with the national income of rich countries. New technology may even allow <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small> to leapfrog over industrialised countries with older technology. This, at least, is the traditional economic theory. In recent years, there has been considerable debate about the extent and speed of convergence in reality.</p><p>One reason to expect catch-up is that workers in poor countries have little access to <small>CAPITAL</small>, so their <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> is often low. Increasing the amount of capital at their disposal by only a small amount can produce huge gains in productivity. Countries with lots of capital, and as a result higher productivity, would enjoy a much smaller gain from a similar increase in capital. This is one possible explanation for the much faster growth of Japan and Germany, compared with the US and the UK, after the second world war and the faster growth of several Asian “tigers”, compared with developed countries, during the 1980s and most of the 1990s.</p>

<h2>central bank</h2>
<p>A guardian of the monetary system. A central <small>BANK</small> sets short-term <small>INTEREST</small> rates and oversees the health of the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>, including by assessing the soundness of banks and acting as <small>LENDER OF LAST RESORT</small> to banks that get into financial difficulties. The <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small>, the US central bank, was founded in 1913. The Bank of England, known affectionately as the “Old Lady of Threadneedle Street”, was established in 1694, 26 years after the creation of the world’s first central bank in Sweden. With the birth of the <small>EURO</small> in 1999, the <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> powers of the central banks of 11 European countries were transferred to a new <small>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</small>, based in Frankfurt.</p><p>During the 1990s there was a trend to make central banks independent from political intervention in their day-to-day operations and allow them to set interest rates. Independent central banks should be able to concentrate on the long-term needs of an economy, whereas political intervention may be guided by the short-term needs of the <small>GOVERNMENT</small>. In theory, an independent central bank should reduce the risk of <small>INFLATION</small>. Some central banks are legally required to set interest rates so as to hit an explicit <small>INFLATION TARGET</small>. Politicians are often tempted to exploit a possible short-term trade-off between inflation and <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>, even though the long-term consequence of easing policy in this way is (most economists say) that the unemployment rate returns to what you started with and inflation is higher. An independent central bank, because it does not have to worry about persuading an electorate to vote for it, is more likely to act in the best <small>LONG-RUN</small> interests of the economy.</p><p>Central banks came under unprecedented stress after the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the subsequent <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>. They increased their intervention in the financial system by pumping huge sums of <small>MONEY</small> into banks to improve their <small>LIQUIDITY</small> and, later, to keep them afloat. This was subject to fierce political criticism in many countries, including the US and Germany. So too was the extension after the crash of lender of last resort support to many financial <small>FIRMS</small> that did not previously have that protection. However, the decision not to extend lender of last resort status to Lehman Brothers, which led to the <small>BANKRUPTCY</small> of the Wall Street investment bank in September 2008, was criticised by many economists for making the economic crisis much worse. Central banks were also criticised by some economists for failing to act in the years before the 2008 crash to prevent <small>BUBBLES</small> in <small>ASSET</small> prices which many blamed for the severity of the economic crisis after they burst.</p>

<h2>charity</h2>
<p>“Bah! Humbug” was Scrooge’s opinion of charitable giving. Some economists reckon charity goes against economic rationality.

Others argue that it shows that <small>ALTRUISM</small> is something that people get pleasure (<small>UTILITY</small>) from, and so are willing to spend some of their <small>INCOME</small> on it. An interesting question is the extent to which the state is competing with private charity when it redistributes <small>MONEY</small> from rich to poor or spends more on health care, and whether this is inefficient. Starting in the late 1990s, there was a sharp rise in philanthropy by wealthy individuals and some big <small>FIRMS</small>. Their businesslike approach to giving is called <small>PHILANTHROCAPITALISM</small>.</p>

<h2>circular economy</h2>
<p>An economy that puts back what it takes out, that is sustainable by design. In its industrial processes, a truly circular economy creates no net pollution or waste. The origins of the idea can be traced back to at least 1966, when Kenneth Boulding, a British economist and systems theorist, described the notion that circular material flows could be a model for the economy in a paper, “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth”. China’s 11th five-year plan, starting in 2006, contained a commitment to promote a circular economy – though it did not seem to do much about it. In 2012, the European Commission published a “Manifesto for a Resource Efficient Europe”, in which it stated that the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> “has no choice but to go for the transition to a resource-efficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy”.</p><p>Among the strategies needed to bring about a circular economy are recycling; refurbishing existing products (and not pursuing built-in obsolescence); designing products, <small>MANUFACTURING</small> processes and <small>SUPPLY</small> chains so as to minimise resource use, waste and pollution at every stage of the product life cycle, from the harvesting of raw materials to the use and ultimate disposal of the product; and educating consumers in how to use and dispose of a product in a non-polluting and non-wasteful way.</p>

<h2>classical economics</h2>
<p>The dominant theory of economics from the 18th century to the 20th century, when it evolved into <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>. Classical economists, who included Adam <small>SMITH</small>, David <small>RICARDO</small> and John Stuart Mill, believed that the pursuit of individual self-interest produced the greatest possible economic benefits for society as a whole through the power of the <small>INVISIBLE HAND</small>. They also believed that an economy is always in <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small> or moving towards it.</p><p>Equilibrium was ensured in the labour market by movements in <small>WAGES</small> and in the <small>CAPITAL</small> market by changes in the rate of <small>INTEREST</small>. The <small>INTEREST RATE</small> ensured that total savings in an economy were equal to total <small>INVESTMENT</small>. In <small>DISEQUILIBRIUM</small>, higher interest rates encouraged more saving and less investment, and lower rates meant less saving and more investment. When the <small>DEMAND</small> for labour rose or fell, wages would also rise or fall to keep the workforce at <small>FULL EMPLOYMENT</small>.</p><p>In the 1920s and 1930s, John Maynard <small>KEYNES</small> attacked some of the main beliefs of classical and neo-classical economics, which became unfashionable. In particular, he argued that the rate of interest was determined or influenced by the speculative actions of investors in <small>BONDS</small> and that wages were inflexible downwards, so that if demand for labour fell, the result would be higher <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> rather than cheaper workers.</p>

Despite predictions that <small>GLOBALISATION</small> and the “death of distance” due to the spread of information technology would reduce the <small>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</small> of clustering, industry clusters have continued to thrive.</p><p>In the early years of industrialisation in the UK clusters were common. Staffordshire was the home of many potteries, so many that the region is still known today as the Potteries. Nottingham was home to many lacemakers, Luton to hatters, and so on. Modern high-tech clusters often gather around prestigious universities on whose research they can piggyback. Silicon Valley is near Stanford University in California, for example, and there are similar high-tech clusters around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) near Boston in the US and Cambridge University in the UK. Singapore’s government is one of a growing number to invest public funds to develop clusters in industries such as pharmaceuticals.</p>

Microchips, for example, started out as a specialised technical <small>INNOVATION</small>, costing a lot and earning their makers a high <small>PROFIT</small> on each chip. Now chips are largely homogeneous: the same chip can be used for many things, and any manufacturer willing to invest in some fairly standardised equipment can make them. As a result, <small>COMPETITION</small> is fierce and <small>PRICES</small> and profit margins are low. Some economists argue that in today’s economy the faster pace of innovation will make the process of commoditisation increasingly common.</p>

<h2>commodity</h2>
<p>A comparatively homogeneous product that can typically be bought in bulk. It usually refers to a raw material – <small>OIL</small>, cotton, cocoa, silver – but can also describe a manufactured product used to make other things, for example microchips used in personal computers. Commodities are often traded on commodity exchanges. Until around 2005, when the world started to experience what many economists regarded as a commodity <small>BUBBLE</small>, for decades the <small>AVERAGE PRICE</small> of natural commodities fell steadily in <small>REAL TERMS</small>, in defiance of some predictions that growing consumption of non-renewables such as copper would force prices up. At times the oil price has risen sharply in real terms, most notably during the 1970s and between 2005 and 2008. This was caused not by the exhaustion of limited supplies but by rationing by the <small>OPEC CARTEL</small>, or war, or fear of it, particularly in the oil-rich Middle East, or – in the most recent case – by some combination of soaring global <small>DEMAND</small> and <small>SPECULATION</small>.</p>

<h2>communism</h2>
<p>The enemy of <small>CAPITALISM</small> and now nearly extinct. Invented by Karl <small>MARX</small>, who predicted that feudalism and capitalism would be succeeded by the “dictatorship of the proletariat”, during which the state would “wither away” and economic life would be organised to achieve “from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”. The Soviet Union was arguably the most prominent attempt to put communism into practice and the result was conspicuous failure, although some modern followers of Marx reckon that the Soviets missed the point.</p>

<h2>comparative advantage</h2>
<p>Paul Samuelson, one of the 20th century’s greatest economists, once remarked that the principle of comparative advantage was the only big idea that <small>ECONOMICS</small> had produced that was both true and surprising. It is also one of the oldest theories in economics, usually ascribed to David <small>RICARDO</small>. The theory underpins the economic case for <small>FREE TRADE</small>. But it is often misunderstood or misrepresented by opponents of free trade. It shows how countries can gain from trading with each other even if one of them is more efficient – it has an <small>ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE</small> – in every sort of economic activity. Comparative advantage is about identifying which activities a country (or firm or individual) is most efficient at doing.</p><p>To see how this theory works, imagine two countries, Alpha and Omega. Each country has 1,000 workers and can make two goods, computers and cars. Alpha’s economy is far more productive than Omega’s. To make a car, Alpha needs 2 workers, compared with Omega’s 4. To make a computer, Alpha uses 10 workers, compared with Omega’s 100. If there is no trade, and in each country half the workers are in each industry, Alpha produces 250 cars and 50 computers and Omega produces 125 cars and 5 computers.</p><p>What if the two countries specialise? Although Alpha makes both cars and computers more efficiently than Omega (it has an absolute advantage), it has a bigger edge in computer-making. So it now devotes most of its resources to that industry, employing 700 workers to make computers and only 300 to make cars. This raises computer output to 70 and cuts car production to 150. Omega switches entirely to cars, turning out 250.</p><p>World output of both goods has risen. Both countries can consume more of both if they trade, but at what <small>PRICE</small>? Neither will want to import what it could make more cheaply at home. So Alpha will want at least 5 cars per computer, and Omega will not give up more than 25 cars per computer. Suppose the terms of trade are fixed at 12 cars per computer and 120 cars are exchanged for 10 computers. Then Alpha ends up with 270 cars and 60 computers, and Omega with 130 cars and 10 computers. Both are better off than they would be if they did not trade.</p><p>This is true even though Alpha has an absolute advantage in making both computers and cars. The reason is that each country has a different comparative advantage. Alpha’s edge is greater in computers than in cars. Omega, although a costlier producer in both industries, is a less expensive maker of cars. If each country specialises in products in which it has a comparative advantage, both will gain from trade.</p><p>In essence, the theory of comparative advantage says that it pays countries to trade because they are different. It is impossible for a country to have no comparative advantage in anything. It may be the least efficient at everything, but it will still have a comparative advantage in the industry in which it is relatively least bad.</p><p>There is no reason to assume that a country’s comparative advantage will be static. If a country does what it has a comparative advantage in and sees its <small>INCOME</small> grow as a result, it can afford better education and <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>. These, in turn, may give it a comparative advantage in other economic activities in future.</p>

<h2>competition</h2>
<p>The more competition there is, the more likely are <small>FIRMS</small> to be efficient and <small>PRICES</small> to be low. Economists have identified several different sorts of competition. <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> is the most competitive market imaginable in which products are identical and everybody is a price taker. Firms earn only normal <small>PROFITS</small>, the bare minimum necessary to keep them in business. If firms earn more than this (excess profits), other firms will enter the market and drive the price down until there are only normal profits to be made.</p><p>Most markets exhibit some form of imperfect or <small>MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION</small>. There are fewer firms than in a perfectly competitive market and each can to some degree create <small>BARRIERS TO ENTRY</small>. So firms can earn some excess profits without a new entrant being able to compete to bring prices down.</p><p>The least competitive market is a <small>MONOPOLY</small>, dominated by a single firm that can earn substantial excess profits by controlling either the amount of <small>OUTPUT</small> in the market or the price (but not both). In this sense it is a price setter. When there are few firms in a market (<small>OLIGOPOLY</small>), they have the opportunity to behave as a monopolist through some form of collusion (see <small><a href="#name.075">CARTEL</a></small>). A market dominated by a single firm does not necessarily have monopoly power if it is a <small>CONTESTABLE MARKET</small>. In such a market, a single firm can dominate only if it produces as efficiently as possible and does not earn excess profits. If it becomes inefficient or earns excess profits, another more efficient or less profitable firm will enter the market and dominate it instead.</p>

<h2>competitiveness</h2>
<p>“Real economists don’t talk about competitiveness,” said Paul Krugman, the 2008 winner of the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>. Real businessmen and real politicians talk about it all the time, however. Many <small>FIRMS</small> have undergone savage downsizing to remain competitive, and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> have set up numerous committees to examine how to sharpen their countries’ economic performance.</p><p>Krugman’s objection was not to the use of the term competitiveness by companies, which often do have competitors that they must beat, but to applying it to countries. At best, it is a meaningless word when applied to national economies; at worst, it encourages <small>PROTECTIONISM</small>. Countries, he claimed, do not compete in the same way as companies. When two companies compete, one’s gain is the other’s loss, whereas international trade, Krugman argued, is not a <small>ZERO-SUM GAME</small>: when two countries compete through trade they both win.</p><p>Yet measures of national competitiveness are not complete nonsense. A country’s future prosperity depends on its ability to increase its <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small>, which government policies can influence. Countries do compete in that they choose policies to promote higher living standards. Even so, conceptual and measurement difficulties mean that the growing number of indices purporting to compare the competitiveness of different countries should probably be taken with a large pinch of salt.</p>

<h2>concentration</h2>
<p>The tendency of a market to be dominated by a few big <small>FIRMS</small>. A high degree of concentration may be evidence of <small>ANTITRUST</small> problems, if it reflects a lack of <small>COMPETITION</small>. Traditionally, economists examined whether there was too much concentration using the <small>HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX</small>, which is determined by adding the squares of the market shares of all firms involved. A low Herfindahl indicated many competitors and thus great difficulty in exercising <small>MARKET POWER</small>; a high Herfindahl, however, suggested a concentrated market in which <small>PRICE</small> rises are easier to sustain. More recently, antitrust authorities have placed less emphasis on concentration. One reason is that it is hard to define the market in which concentration should be measured. Instead, antitrust authorities have turned their attention to finding examples of firms earning excessive <small>PROFITS</small> or holding back <small>INNOVATION</small>, although this too raises tricky conceptual and practical questions.</p>

<h2>corruption</h2>
<p>Being corrupt is not just bad for the soul, it also harms the economy. Research has found that in countries with a lot of corruption, less of their <small>GDP</small> goes into <small>INVESTMENT</small> and they have lower <small>GROWTH</small> rates. Corrupt countries invest less in education, a sector of the economy that pays big economic dividends but small bribes, than do clean countries, thereby restricting their <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>. They also attract less <small>FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT</small>.</p><p>There is no such thing as good corruption, but some sorts of corruption are less bad than others. Some economists point to similarities between bribery and paying taxes or buying a licence to operate. Where it is predictable – where the briber knows what to pay and can be sure of getting what it pays for – corruption harms the economy far less than where it is capricious.</p><p>The absence of corruption has huge economic benefits, however, by allowing the development of institutions that enable a market economy to function efficiently. In many of the world’s more corrupt countries, the distinction between private interest and public duty is still unfamiliar. Countries that have made graft the exception rather than the rule in the conduct of public affairs have been helped to grow by the emergence of institutions such as an independent judiciary, a free press, a well-paid civil service and, perhaps crucially, an economy in which <small>FIRMS</small> have to compete for customers and <small>CAPITAL</small>.</p>

With careful selection of the assumptions used in cost-benefit analysis it can be made to support, or oppose, almost anything. This is particularly so when the decision being contemplated involves some cost or benefit for which there is no market <small>PRICE</small> or which, because of an <small>EXTERNALITY</small>, is not fully reflected in the market price.

<h2>credit creation</h2>
<p>Making loans. Often the amount of credit creation is subject to <small>REGULATION</small>.

A <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> tries to keep the amount of credit creation below the level at which it would increase the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> so much that <small>INFLATION</small> accelerates. This was never easy to get right even when most lending was by <small>BANKS</small>, but it has become much harder since the 1980s with the growth of lending by institutions other than regulated banks.

<h2>credit crunch</h2>

Economists disagreed over whether this was a result of lenders becoming more <small>RISK-AVERSE</small>, less able to lend because of declining <small>CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS</small> following big <small>INVESTMENT</small> losses, or rising uncertainty about the economic outlook. Once a credit crunch begins it can be hard to uncrunch it, not least because of what <small>KEYNES</small> called the paradox of thrift. There is much debate among economists about whether a bank-based credit crunch is easier or harder to solve, or requires different sorts of solutions, than one more centred in the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>, such as that which began in 2007.</p>

<h2>crowds</h2>
<p>In 1906, Francis Galton, a Victorian polymath, visited a livestock fair at which villagers were invited to guess the weight of an ox after it was slaughtered and dressed. Not one of the 800 who guessed hit the exact mark: 1,198 pounds. However, the median (see <small><a href="#name.027">AVERAGE</a></small>) of the 800 guesses was very close indeed, at 1,197 pounds. This finding, with its implication that the insights of the many can surpass the wisdom of any one individual, has been the subject of growing attention in recent years. The soaring volume of mass data and the opportunities for interaction provided by the internet, together with today’s more sophisticated analytical technologies, have inspired numerous efforts to tap the “wisdom of crowds”. Some <small>FIRMS</small> now engage in “crowd-sourcing” to generate both incremental product improvements and breakthrough ideas. There has also been rapid growth in “crowd funding”, raising money from the public using purpose-built websites such as IndieGogo and Kickstarter. The trick is to know the difference between when a crowd is being insightful and when, as <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small> has shown, <small>INFORMATION</small> flows and psychological biases within the crowd can lead to irrational outcomes, such as <small>BUBBLES</small>.</p>

Yet the idea lost much of its lustre when in January 2002, a decade after it adopted a currency board, Argentina devalued the peso amid economic and political crisis.

<h2>deadweight cost/loss</h2>
<p>The extent to which the value and impact of <small>TAXATION</small>, tax relief or <small>SUBSIDY</small> is reduced because of its side-effects. For instance, increasing the amount of tax levied on workers’ pay will lead some workers to stop working or work less, so reducing the amount of extra tax to be collected. However, creating a tax relief or subsidy to encourage people to buy life <small>INSURANCE</small> would have a deadweight cost because people who would have bought insurance anyway would benefit.</p>

<h2>debt</h2>
<p>“Neither a borrower nor a lender be,” wrote Shakespeare in <i>Hamlet.</i> Actually, the availability of debt, and the willingness to take it on, is a crucial ingredient of economic <small>GROWTH</small>, because it allows individuals, <small>FIRMS</small> and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> to make investments they would not otherwise be able to afford. The price of debt is <small>INTEREST</small>. Until recently, lending was an activity dominated by <small>BANKS</small> (although mortgages for individuals buying their homes have long been available from special housing <small>SAVINGS</small> institutions). Starting in the 1960s, debt became increasingly available from other sources. Companies have sold trillions of dollars-worth of <small>BONDS</small> to investors in the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>. Individuals have been able to borrow with credit cards, and for those who have nowhere else to turn there are pawn shops and loan sharks, which charge high rates of interest.</p><p>In most countries, by far the biggest single borrower is the state, through the <small>NATIONAL DEBT</small>. Total private-sector debt in 2013 was 156% of GDP in the US, compared with less than 60% in 1950. Starting in the late 1990s, some economists expressed concern about rising consumer debt, in particular, and about the loosening of lending standards for individuals, firms, <small>HEDGE FUNDS</small> and <small>PRIVATE EQUITY</small> investors borrowing in the financial markets. The <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> that started in 2007, followed by the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>, seemed to prove that much of this borrowing was unsustainable and imprudent, having exposed the global economy to excessive <small>RISK</small>. Yet, as of 2015, the global economy was dealing with significantly more debt than there had been in 2008.</p>

<h2>debt forgiveness</h2>
<p>Cancelling or rescheduling a borrower’s <small>DEBT</small> to lessen the pain of the debt burden. Many economists regard debt forgiveness as the best way to relieve the financial problems facing poorer countries. Some countries have had to pay so much in <small>INTEREST</small> each year to foreign lenders that little <small>MONEY</small> remained to spend on the long-term solutions to their <small>POVERTY</small>, such as educating their workers and building a modern <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>. In 1998, when the debt crisis in <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small> was arguably at its worst, the <small>WORLD BANK</small> calculated that around 40 of the world’s poorest countries had an “unsustainably high” debt burden: the present value of their total debts was more than 220% of their <small>EXPORTS</small>.</p><p>Debt forgiveness has potential drawbacks. For instance, there is a risk of <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>. If countries that borrow too much are let off their financial obligations, poor countries may feel they have nothing to lose by borrowing as much as they can. The money goes straight into the hands of the poor country’s <small>GOVERNMENT</small>, which may deliver little benefit to the people in greatest need, if the government is rife with <small>CORRUPTION</small>, which is often the case in such countries. This is why policymakers often argue that debt forgiveness should come with a <small>CONDITIONALITY</small> clause, for instance, a requirement that countries have a track record of implementing economic reforms designed to prevent a repeat of the errors that first created the need for debt forgiveness. This is the approach taken by the World Bank’s <small>HIPC</small> (highly indebted poor country) initiative, launched in 1996 and expanded in 1999. As of 2015, 36 of the 39 poor countries eligible under the programme had made enough progress in reform to have some debt forgiven.</p>

<h2>deflation</h2>
<p>Since 1930 it has been the norm in most developed countries for <small>AVERAGE PRICES</small> to rise year after year. However, before 1930 deflation (falling prices) was as likely as <small>INFLATION</small>. On the eve of the first world war, for example, prices in the UK, overall, were not much higher than they had been at the time of the great fire of London in 1666. Even in the modern economy, inflation is not inevitable. Deflation occurred in Japan during the 1990s. During the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> after the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, some of the world’s leading central bankers worried publicly about the danger of deflation and used this to justify unusually loose <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> that in some instances included negative short-term <small>INTEREST RATES</small>.</p><p>Deflation is a persistent fall in the general prices of goods and <small>SERVICES</small>. It is not to be confused with a decline in prices in one economic sector or with a fall in the inflation rate (which is known as <small>DISINFLATION</small>).</p><p>Sometimes deflation can be harmless, perhaps even a good thing, if lower prices lift real <small>INCOME</small> and hence spending power. In the last 30 years of the 19th century, for example, <small>CONSUMER PRICES</small> fell by almost half in the US, as the expansion of railways and advances in industrial technology brought cheaper ways to make everything. Yet annual real <small>GDP</small> growth over the period averaged more than 4%.</p><p>Deflation is dangerous, however – more so even than inflation – when it reflects a sharp slump in <small>DEMAND</small>, excess <small>CAPACITY</small> and a shrinking <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>, as in the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small> of the 1930s (and as it was feared would happen during the Great Recession that followed the crash of 2008). In the four years to 1933, US consumer prices fell by 25% and real GDP by 30%. Runaway deflation of this sort can be much more damaging than runaway inflation, because it creates a vicious spiral that is hard to escape. The expectation that prices will be lower tomorrow may encourage consumers to delay purchases, depressing <small>DEMAND</small> and forcing <small>FIRMS</small> to cut prices by even more. Falling prices also inflate the real burden of <small>DEBT</small> (that is, increase real interest rates) causing <small>BANKRUPTCY</small> and <small>BANK</small> failure. This makes deflation particularly dangerous for economies that have large amounts of corporate debt. Most serious of all, deflation can make monetary policy ineffective: nominal interest rates cannot be negative, so real rates can get stuck too high.</p>

<h2>demand</h2>
<p>One of the two words economists use most; the other is <small>SUPPLY</small>. These are the twin driving forces of the market economy. Demand is not just about measuring what people want; for economists, it refers to the amount of a good or service that people are both willing and able to buy. The <small>DEMAND CURVE</small> measures the relationship between the <small>PRICE</small> of a good and the amount of it demanded. Usually, as the price rises, fewer people are willing and able to buy it; in other words, demand falls (but see <small><a href="#name.249">GIFFEN GOODS</a>, <a href="#name.436">NORMAL GOODS</a></small> and <small><a href="#name.307">INFERIOR GOODS</a></small>). When demand changes, economists explain this in one of two ways. A movement along the demand curve occurs when a price change alters the quantity demanded; but if the price were to go back to where it was before, so would the amount demanded. A shift in the demand curve occurs when the amount demanded would be different from what it was previously at any chosen price, for example if there is no change in the market price, but demand rises or falls. The slope of the demand curve indicates the <small>ELASTICITY</small> of demand. For approaches to modelling demand see <small><a href="#name.568">REVEALED PREFERENCE</a></small>.</p><p>Policymakers seek to manipulate aggregate demand to keep the economy growing as fast as is possible without pushing up inflation. <small>KEYNESIANS</small> try to manage demand through <small>FISCAL POLICY</small>; monetarists prefer to use the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>. Neither approach has been especially successful in practice, particularly when attempting to manage short-term demand through <small>FINE TUNING</small>.</p>

<h2>demographics</h2>
<p>People, and the statistical study of them. In the 200 years since Thomas Malthus forecast that population <small>GROWTH</small> would result in mass starvation, dire predictions based on demographic trends have come to be taken with a pinch of salt. Even so, demography does matter. In developed countries, economists have studied the impact of the post-war “baby-boomer” population bulge as it has grown older. In the 1980s, as the bulge dominated the workforce, it may have contributed to a sharp, if temporary, rise in <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> in many countries. Boomers starting to save for retirement may have increased <small>DEMAND</small> for <small>SHARES</small>, so fuelling the <small>BULL</small> stockmarket of the 1990s; as they now retire and sell their shares for spending <small>MONEY</small>, they may cause a long <small>BEAR</small> market. Furthermore, as they become elderly and retire, healthcare spending and retirement <small>PENSIONS</small> are likely to eat up a growing share of <small>GDP</small>. To the extent that these are provided by the state, this will mean increased <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and higher taxes. But whether they are provided by the state or by the private sector, the ageing of baby-boomers will impose a growing financial burden on the younger workers that have to support them (see <small><a href="#name.556">REPLACEMENT RATE</a></small>). Economists have tried to measure the extent of this burden using <small>GENERATIONAL ACCOUNTING</small>, which looks at the amount of wealth transferred from one generation to another over the lifetimes of the members of each generation.</p><p>Economists have also developed many different theories to explain why populations grow and why the fertility rate slowed sharply, to below the replacement rate, in many developed countries during the 1990s. One explanation is based on the notion that people have children so that there is somebody to look after them in old age. Fertility rates fell because the state increasingly looked after retired people, and infant mortality rates were lower so fewer births were required to ensure that there were some children around in the parental dotage. Also, with a lower <small>PROBABILITY</small> of a child dying, it paid the parents to have fewer children and to channel their energy and resources into maximising the <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small> of the few. Better female education and participation in the labour market may also have played a significant role in slowing population growth, especially when combined with an important <small>INNOVATION</small>: the cheap and easy availability of reliable contraception. These trends have led to predictions that the total human population of the planet will not rise as much as once seemed likely above the 7 billion it reached in around 2011. Indeed, that may have been the year of “peak children”; the record 1.9 billion people then aged 15 or under may never be exceeded.</p>

<h2>deposit insurance</h2>
<p>Protection for your <small>SAVINGS</small>, in case your <small>BANK</small> goes bust. Arrangements vary around the world, but in most countries deposit insurance is required by the <small>GOVERNMENT</small> and paid for by banks (and ultimately their customers), which contribute a small slice of their <small>ASSETS</small> to a central, usually government-run, <small>INSURANCE</small> fund. If a bank defaults, this fund guarantees its customers’ deposits, at least up to a certain amount. By reassuring banks’ customers that their cash is protected, deposit insurance aims to prevent them from panicking and causing a bank run, and thereby reduces <small>SYSTEMIC RISK</small>. The US introduced it in 1933, after a massive bank panic led to widespread <small>BANKRUPTCY</small>, deepening its <small>DEPRESSION</small>. As fear of bank failures grew in the months before the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, governments in many countries, including the US, significantly expanded the coverage of deposit insurance.</p><p>The downside of deposit insurance is that it creates a <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>. By insulating depositors from <small>DEFAULTS</small>, deposit insurance reduces their incentive to monitor banks closely. Also banks can take greater risks, safe in the knowledge that there is a state-financed safety net to catch them if they fall.</p><p>There are no easy solutions to this moral hazard. One approach is to monitor what banks do closely. This is easier said than done, not least because of the high cost. Another is to ensure capital adequacy by requiring banks to set aside, just in case, specified amounts of <small>CAPITAL</small> when they take on different amounts of <small>RISK</small>.</p><p>Alternatively, the state safety net could be shrunk, by splitting banks into two types: super-safe, government-insured “narrow banks”, which stick to traditional business and invest only in secure assets; and uninsured institutions, “broad banks”, which could range more widely under a much lighter regulatory system. Savers who invested in a broad bank would probably earn much higher <small>RETURNS</small> because it could invest in riskier assets; but they would also lose their shirts if it went bust.</p><p>Yet another possible answer is to require every bank to finance a small proportion of its assets by selling subordinated <small>DEBT</small> to other institutions, with the stipulation that the <small>YIELD</small> on this debt must not be more than so many (say 50) basis points higher than the rate on a corresponding risk-free instrument. Subordinated debt (uninsured certificates of deposit) is simply junior debt. Its holders are at the back of the queue for their <small>MONEY</small> if the bank gets into trouble and they have no safety net. Investors will buy subordinated debt at a yield quite close to the risk-free <small>INTEREST RATE</small> only if they are sure the bank is low-risk. To sell its debt, the bank will have to persuade informed investors of this. If it cannot convince them, it cannot operate. This exploits the fact that bankers know more about banking than do their supervisors. It asks banks not to be good citizens but to look only to their <small>PROFITS</small>. Unlike the present regime, it exploits all the available <small>INFORMATION</small> and properly aligns everybody’s incentives. This ingenious idea was first tried in Argentina, where it became a victim of the country’s economic, banking and political crisis of 2001–02 before it really had a chance to prove itself.</p>

<h2>depression</h2>
<p>A bad, depressingly prolonged <small>RECESSION</small> in economic activity. According to an old joke, when your neighbour loses his job, it’s a recession; when you lose your job it’s a depression. The textbook definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of declining <small>OUTPUT</small>. A slump is where output falls by at least 10%. A depression is an even deeper and more prolonged slump.</p><p>The most famous example is the Great Depression of the 1930s. After growing strongly during the “Roaring 20s”, the US economy (among others) went into prolonged recession. Output fell by 30%. <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> soared and stayed high: in 1939 the jobless rate was still 17% of the workforce. Roughly half of the 25,000 <small>BANKS</small> in the US failed. An attempt to stimulate growth, the New Deal, was the most far-reaching example of active <small>FISCAL POLICY</small> then seen and greatly extended the role of the state in the US economy. However, the depression only ended with the onset of preparations to enter the second world war.</p><p>Why did the Great Depression happen? It is not entirely clear, but forget the popular explanation: that it all went wrong with the Wall Street stockmarket crash of October 1929; that the slump persisted because policymakers just sat there; and that it took the New Deal to put things right. As early as 1928 the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small>, worried about financial <small>SPECULATION</small> and inflated stock <small>PRICES</small>, began raising <small>INTEREST RATES</small>. In the spring of 1929, industrial production started to slow; the recession started in the summer, well before the stockmarket lost half of its value between October 24th and mid-November. Coming on top of a recession that had already begun, the <small>CRASH</small> set the scene for a severe contraction but not for the decade-long slump that ensued.</p><p>So why did a bad downturn keep getting worse, year after year, not just in the US but also around the globe? In 1929 most of the world was on the <small>GOLD STANDARD</small>, which should have helped stabilise the US economy. As demand in the US slowed its <small>IMPORTS</small> fell, its <small>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</small> moved further into surplus and <small>GOLD</small> should have flowed into the country, expanding the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> and boosting the economy. But the Fed, which was still worried about easy <small>CREDIT</small> and speculation, dampened the impact of this adjustment mechanism, and instead the money supply got tighter. This was accompanied by a rise in <small>PROTECTIONISM. GOVERNMENTS</small> everywhere, hit by falling demand, tried to reduce imports through <small>TARIFFS</small>, causing international trade to collapse. Then US banks started to fail, and the Fed let them. As the crisis of confidence spread more banks failed, and as people rushed to turn bank deposits into cash the money supply collapsed.</p><p>Bad <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> was abetted by bad fiscal policy. Taxes were raised in 1932 to help balance the <small>BUDGET</small> and restore confidence. The New Deal brought <small>DEPOSIT INSURANCE</small> and boosted government, but it also piled taxes on business and sought to prevent “excessive” <small>COMPETITION</small>. Price controls were brought in, along with other anti-business regulations. None of this stopped – and indeed may well have contributed to – the economy falling into recession again in 1937–38, after a brief recovery starting in 1935.</p>

<h2>deregulation</h2>
<p>Cutting red tape. The process of removing legal or quasi-legal restrictions on the amount of <small>COMPETITION</small>, the sorts of business done, or the <small>PRICES</small> charged within a particular industry. During the last two decades of the 20th century, many <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> committed to the free market pursued policies of <small>LIBERALISATION</small> based on substantial amounts of deregulation hand-in-hand with the <small>PRIVATISATION</small> of industries owned by the state. The aim was to decrease the role of government in the economy and to increase competition. Even so, red tape remained alive and well. In the US, with some 170 federal entities issuing more than 3,500 rules a year, in 2014 the Code of Federal Regulations was more than 175,000 pages long. That was not all bad. According to estimates by the American Office of Management and Budget, in 2014 the annual cost of these rules was $57 billion to $85 billion, but the annual benefits were somewhere between $216 billion and $812 billion.</p><p>The extent of deregulation even during the gung-ho liberalising era of Reaganism and Thatcherism was overhyped. No modern economy could function effectively without plenty of <small>REGULATION</small>. The real debate, beneath the hype, is over how to design regulation that improves the functioning of the economy, and especially of markets, rather than making matters worse. Many commentators blamed deregulation for the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and subsequent <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>; certainly, there has been a significant increase in financial regulation since the crash. However, there is plenty of evidence that badly designed or executed regulation – so-called <small>REGULATORY FAILURE</small> – played a significant role in the crisis.</p>

<h2>derivatives</h2>
<p>Financial <small>ASSETS</small> that “derive” their value from other assets. For example, an option to buy a <small>SHARE</small> is derived from the share. Even before the financial crisis that hit in 2008, which many commentators linked to the rapid rise of derivatives use, some politicians and others responsible for financial <small>REGULATION</small> blamed the growing use of derivatives for increasing <small>VOLATILITY</small> in asset prices, and for being a source of danger to their users. Warren Buffett, a famed American investor, described them as “financial weapons of mass destruction”.</p><p>Until the economic crisis, economists mostly regarded derivatives as a good thing, allowing more precise pricing of financial risk and better <small>RISK MANAGEMENT</small>. Even then, however, they conceded that when derivatives were misused the leverage (or <small>GEARING</small>) that is often an integral part of them could have devastating consequences. So they came with an economists’ health warning: if you don’t understand it, don’t use it. Now, at least temporarily, many economists are taking a view of the usefulness of derivatives that is closer to Buffett’s, as are many erstwhile users of these <small>FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</small>.</p><p>The world of derivatives is riddled with jargon. Here are translations of the most important bits:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">A forward contract commits the user to buying or selling an asset at a specific <small>PRICE</small> on a specific date in the future.</span></li><li><span class="black1">A future is a forward contract that is traded on an exchange.</span></li><li><span class="black1">A swap is a contract by which two parties exchange the cash flow linked to a liability or an asset. For example, two companies, one with a loan on a fixed <small>INTEREST RATE</small> over ten years and the other with a similar loan on a floating interest rate over the same period, may agree to take over each other’s obligations, so that the first pays the floating rate and the second the fixed rate. A currency swap involves an agreement between, say, a borrower in dollars and another borrower in pounds to take over each other’s <small>INTEREST</small> and principal payments, in the currency in which the borrowing took place.</span></li><li><span class="black1">An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell or buy a particular asset at a particular price, on or before a specified date.</span></li><li><span class="black1">An over-the-counter is a derivative that is not traded on an exchange but is purchased from, say, an investment <small>BANK</small>.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Exotics are derivatives that are complex or are available in emerging economies.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Plain-vanilla derivatives, in contrast to exotics, are typically exchange-traded, relate to developed economies and are comparatively uncomplicated.</span></li></ul><p>Many derivatives are the result of <small>SECURITISATION</small>, in which investors buy a contract the value of which is linked to a bundle of assets created by a bank or company. These include collateralised debt obligations such as <small>SUBPRIME</small> mortgage-backed <small>SECURITIES</small>, the sharp fall in the value of which helped to trigger the financial crisis that resulted in the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>.</p>

<h2>developing countries</h2>
<p>A euphemism for the world’s poor countries, also known, often optimistically, as emerging economies. Some four-fifths of the world’s 7 billion people already live in developing countries, many of them in abject <small>POVERTY</small>.</p><p>Economists disagree about how likely – and how fast – developing countries are to become developed. <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> predicts that poor countries will grow faster than richer ones. The reason is <small>DIMINISHING RETURNS</small> on <small>CAPITAL</small>. Since poor countries start with less capital, they should reap higher returns than a richer country with more capital from each slice of new <small>INVESTMENT</small>. But this <small>CATCH-UP EFFECT</small> (or convergence) is not supported by the data. For one thing, there is no such thing as a typical developing country. The official developing world includes the (sometimes) fast-growing <small>BRICS</small> and the poorest nations in Africa. Studies of the relationship between <small>GROWTH</small> and <small>GDP</small> per head in rich and poor countries found no evidence that poorer countries grew faster. Indeed, if anything, poorer countries have grown more slowly.</p><p><small>DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS</small> has argued that this is because poor countries have unique problems that require different policy solutions from those offered by conventional developed-world economics. But new <small>ENDOGENOUS</small> growth theory instead argues that there is conditional convergence. Hold constant such factors as a country’s fertility rate, its <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small> and its <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policies (proxied by the share of current government spending in GDP), and poorer countries generally grow faster than richer ones. Since, in reality, other factors are not constant (not all countries have the same amount of human capital or the same government policies), absolute convergence does not happen.</p><p>Government policies seem to be crucial. Countries with broadly free-market policies – in particular, <small>FREE TRADE</small> and the maintenance of secure <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small> – have raised their growth rates. Open economies have grown much faster on <small>AVERAGE</small> than closed economies, including, in the first decade of the 21st century, formerly slow-growing parts of Africa (thanks especially to their openness to trade with China). Higher <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> relative to GDP is usually associated with slower growth. Furthermore, high <small>INFLATION</small> is bad for growth and so is political instability. The poorest countries can indeed catch up. Their chances of doing so are maximised by policies that give a greater role to <small>COMPETITION</small> and incentives, at home and abroad.</p><p>Despite starting with a big disadvantage, there is evidence that some developing countries do not help themselves because they squander the resources they have. Institutions that produce effective <small>GOVERNANCE</small> of an economy are crucial. Those countries that use their resources well can grow quickly. Indeed, the world’s fastest-growing economies over the past decade or so have been a small subgroup of exceptional performers among the poor countries. Many developing economies suffered as the economic crisis spread from the US to the rest of the world in 2008 and after, confounding fashionable decoupling theories, although some of the biggest continued to grow strongly after the initial shock. And by that year, the share of rich countries in total world GDP was already down to 44% from 53% in 1990. Developing economies are expected to have further increased their share significantly by 2030.</p>

<p>Spawned by the end of the colonial era in the 1950s and 1960s, a whole branch of economic theory grew up around the question of how to promote economic development in poor countries. The proposition on which development economics was built was that poor countries were intrinsically different from rich ones and so needed their own set of economic models. Some development economists argued, for instance, that the self-interested, rational individual <i>(Homo economicus)</i> did not exist in traditional tribal societies. They claimed that because many poor countries had large agricultural populations and were often dependent on a few <small>COMMODITY EXPORTS</small> for foreign exchange earnings, economic policies that suited rich countries would not work for them.</p><p>With hindsight, much of this was misguided, and policies based on it had disastrous effects. Development economists believed that the state had to play a big role in fostering modernisation. Instead, the result was huge, inefficient bureaucracies riddled with <small>CORRUPTION</small>, massive <small>BUDGET DEFICITS</small> and rampant <small>INFLATION</small>. During the 1990s, and continuing at least until the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, most governments of developing countries started to reverse these policies and undo the damage by introducing instead policies based on similar economic models to those that had worked in rich countries. However, the <small>SEQUENCING</small> of these new policies seemed to make a big difference to how well they worked. Doing the right things in the right order is crucial.</p>

<h2>diminishing returns</h2>
<p>The more you have, the smaller is the extra benefit you get from having even more; also known as diseconomies of scale (see <small><a href="#name.173">ECONOMIES OF SCALE</a></small>). For instance, when workers have a lot of <small>CAPITAL</small>, giving them a little more may not increase their <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> anywhere near as much as would giving the same amount to workers who currently have little or no capital. This underpins the <small>CATCH-UP EFFECT</small>, whereby there is (supposedly) convergence between the rates of <small>GROWTH</small> of <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small> and developed ones. In the new economy of the 21st century, some economists argue, capital may not suffer from diminishing returns, or at least the amount of diminishing will be much smaller. There may even be ever-increasing returns.</p>

<h2>direct taxation</h2>
<p>Taxes levied on the <small>INCOME</small> or wealth of an individual or company. Contrast with <small>INDIRECT TAXATION</small>. In much of the world, direct tax rates fell during the 1980s and 1990s, partly because some economists argued that high rates of tax on income discouraged people from working, and that high rates of tax on <small>PROFIT</small> encouraged companies to move to countries with lower rates. Furthermore, high rates of <small>INCOME TAX</small> were viewed as politically unpopular. Even so, although rates were cut, because both personal income and corporate profits grew steadily throughout this period the total amount collected via direct taxation continued to rise. Economists often disagree about which of direct taxes or indirect taxes are the least inefficient method of taxation. The sharp increase in <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> (except in countries committed to <small>AUSTERITY</small> measures) in response to the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, along with the rise in inequality as the “one percent” in particular profited from loose <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>, prompted renewed consideration of the case for higher taxes, especially on the rich.</p>

<h2>discounted cash flow</h2>
<p>How much less is a sum of <small>MONEY</small> due in the future worth today? The answer is found by discounting the future cash flow, using an <small>INTEREST RATE</small> that reflects the fact that money in future is worth less than money now, because money now could be invested and earn <small>INTEREST</small>, whereas future money cannot. <small>FIRMS</small> use discounted cash flow to judge whether an <small>INVESTMENT</small> project is worthwhile. The interest rate is a means of reflecting the <small>OPPORTUNITY COST</small> of tying up money in the investment project. To test whether an investment makes economic sense, the <small>INCOME</small> must be discounted so that it can be measured against the costs. If the present value of the benefits exceeds the costs, the investment is a good one.</p>

<h2>disintermediation</h2>
<p>Cutting out the middleman. Disintermediation has become a buzzword in financial services in particular, as competitive and technological changes have reduced the need for established intermediaries. At least until the economic crisis that began in 2007, <small>BANKS</small> were seeing much of their business slip away, such as lending to companies that found they could tap <small>CAPITAL MARKETS</small> directly. At the end of the 1990s, <small>NEW ECONOMY</small> theorists argued that many retailers would be disintermediated as the internet enabled customers to transact directly with producers without needing to visit a shop. But this happened only partially, because many established retailers created internet distribution in tandem with their offline stores as part of a “bricks-and-clicks” strategy. Still, the effect of Amazon on traditional retailing has been huge (and is still growing fast), as has that of Netflix on movie rental stores. More recently, there have been predictions that the blockchain software that powers <small>BITCOIN</small> will lead to the disintermediation of many traditional financial services intermediaries.</p>

<h2>diversification</h2>
<p>Not putting all your eggs in one basket.

At the sharp end of business, however, diversification is somewhat out of fashion. Economic studies of diversifying corporate mergers have found that these often hurt the shareholders of the acquiring firm; by contrast, diversified <small>FIRMS</small> that have sold off non-core businesses have typically made their shareholders much better off.</p>

<h2>dividend</h2>
<p>The part of a company’s <small>PROFIT</small> distributed to shareholders. Unlike <small>INTEREST</small> on <small>DEBT</small>, the payment of a dividend is not automatic; it is decided by the company’s managers, subject to the approval of the company’s owners (shareholders). However, when a company cuts its dividend, this usually triggers a sharp fall in its <small>SHARE PRICE</small> by more than would appear to be justified by the reduced dividend. Economists theorise that this is because a dividend cut signals to shareholders that the company is in a bad way, with more bad news to follow. The tax treatment of dividends can influence how firms return <small>MONEY</small> to their shareholders; often, a more <small>TAX-EFFICIENT</small> method than paying dividends is for the firm to repurchase some of its own shares in the stockmarket.</p>

<h2>Dodd-Frank Act</h2>
<p>The single biggest regulatory reform resulting from the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and its aftermath. Signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was named after the two men who steered it through Congress, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Chris Dodd, and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee chairman, Barney Frank. A remarkable 848 pages long, it was by far the most significant overhaul of financial <small>REGULATION</small> in the US since the laws introduced during the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small>, which included the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the forced separation of <small>INVESTMENT</small> banking from wholesale banking. Dodd-Frank’s effects were felt far beyond the country’s borders because of the increasing <small>GLOBALISATION</small> of finance and the significant role that the US plays in the global <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>.</p><p>The main components of Dodd-Frank are:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">special regulations for so-called systemically important financial institutions deemed <small>TOO BIG TO FAIL</small>;</span></li><li><span class="black1">a requirement for financial firms to have “living wills” to enable their “orderly liquidation” if necessary;</span></li><li><span class="black1">a requirement for robust “stress testing” by financial <small>FIRMS</small> to ensure they have sufficient <small>BALANCE SHEET</small> strength to survive a <small>CRASH</small> like that in 2008 or worse;</span></li><li><span class="black1">a “Volcker Rule” intended to restore some of the forced separation of wholesale banking and investment banking and other <small>RISK</small>-taking activities;</span></li><li><span class="black1">the creation of several new regulatory agencies, including a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with a mission to ensure that financial products offered to consumers are appropriate to their needs, and that consumers have enough <small>INFORMATION</small> to adequately evaluate these products.</span></li></ul><p>To its critics, Dodd-Frank is notable mostly for its remarkable length, a lack of clarity which means that years after becoming law some of its key provisions had not been implemented, and a lack of clear evidence that it has changed the financial system for the better. Perhaps there had been too much haste and not enough rigorous analysis in responding to public pressure for Congress to act after the 2008 crash.</p>

<h2>dollarisation</h2>
<p>When a country’s own money is replaced as its citizens’ preferred currency by the US dollar. This can be a deliberate <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policy or the result of many private choices by buyers and sellers (for instance, at the first sign of trouble, investors across Latin America generally flee into dollars). When it is government policy, dollarisation is, in essence, a beefed-up <small>CURRENCY BOARD</small>.</p><p>The appeal of dollarisation is that the value of the dollar is more stable than the distrusted local currency, which may well have a history of suddenly falling in value. By eliminating all possible <small>RISK</small> of <small>DEVALUATION</small> against the dollar, the cost of local companies’ and the government’s borrowing in international markets is reduced, as the currency risk is removed. A big downside is that the country hands over control of <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> to the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small>, and the right <small>INTEREST RATE</small> for the US may not be appropriate for the dollarised country, if that country and the US do not constitute an <small>OPTIMAL CURRENCY AREA</small>. This is one reason that in some countries the local currency has been displaced by another stable currency, such as, in some central European economies, the <small>EURO</small> (and before that the D-mark).</p>

Participants in international trade are often accused of dumping by domestic <small>FIRMS</small> charging more than rival <small>IMPORTS</small>. Countries can slap duties on cheap imports that they judge are being dumped in their markets. Often this amounts to thinly disguised <small>PROTECTIONISM</small> against more efficient foreign firms.</p><p>In practice, genuine predatory pricing is rare – certainly much rarer than anti-dumping actions – because it relies on the unlikely ability of a single producer to dominate a world market.

<h2>economic and monetary union</h2>
<p>In January 1999, 11 of the 15 countries in the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> merged their national currencies into a single European currency, the <small>EURO</small>. This decision was motivated partly by politics and partly by hoped-for economic benefits from the creation of a single, integrated European economy. These benefits included currency stability and low <small>INFLATION</small>, underwritten by an independent <small>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</small> (a particular boon for countries with poor inflation records, such as Italy and Spain, but less so for traditionally low-inflation Germany). Furthermore, European businesses and individuals stood to save from handling one currency rather than many. Comparing <small>PRICES</small> and <small>WAGES</small> across the <small>EURO ZONE</small> became easier, increasing <small>COMPETITION</small> by making it easier for companies to sell throughout the euro zone and for consumers to shop around.</p><p>Forming the single currency also involved big risks, however. Euro members gave up both the right to set their own <small>INTEREST RATES</small> and the option of moving <small>EXCHANGE RATES</small> against each other. They also agreed to limit their <small>BUDGET DEFICITS</small> under a Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Some economists argued that this loss of flexibility could prove costly if their economies did not behave as one and could not easily adjust in other ways. How well the euro zone functions will depend on how closely it resembles what economists call an <small>OPTIMAL CURRENCY AREA</small>. When the euro economies are not growing in unison, a common <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> risks being too loose for some and too tight for others. If so, there may need to be large transfers of funds from regions doing well to those doing badly. But if the effects of shocks persist, fiscal transfers would merely delay the day of reckoning; ultimately, wages or people (or both) would have to shift.</p><p>In its first few years, the euro fell sharply against the dollar, though it recovered during late 2002. Sluggish growth in some European economies led to intense pressure for interest-rate cuts, and to the SGP being breached, though not scrapped. Even so, by 2009 16 of the 27 member countries of the European Union had adopted the euro, and it was informally used by five other countries (three of which became full members by 2015, taking the total to 19 of the 28 EU countries).</p><p>The <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 put the euro zone under considerable stress, as several of its member countries were plunged into a sovereign <small>DEBT</small> crisis. There were widespread predictions that countries with unsustainably large ratios of <small>GOVERNMENT</small> debt would have to leave the euro, though the process by which what was believed to be an illegal action might happen was never made clear. The phrase “Grexit” was coined to describe the possible withdrawal from the euro of Greece, the most unsustainably indebted member state. Despite a change in policy to be more supportive of <small>GROWTH</small> by the European Central Bank following the appointment of Mario Draghi to lead it in 2011, the euro-zone governments spent years going from crisis to crisis as they tried to figure out a way to save their monetary union. By late 2015, the weakening of the euro seemed likely to take its dollar value below $1.</p>

<h2>economic sanctions</h2>
<p>A way of punishing errant countries, which is currently more acceptable than bombing or invading them. One or more restrictions are imposed on international trade with the targeted country in order to persuade its <small>GOVERNMENT</small> to change a policy. Possible sanctions include limiting export or import trade with the target; constraining <small>INVESTMENT</small> in the target; and preventing transfers of <small>MONEY</small> involving citizens or the government of the target. Sanctions can be multilateral, with many countries acting together, perhaps under the auspices of the <small>UN</small>, or unilateral, when one country takes action on its own.</p><p>How effective sanctions are is debatable. According to one study, between 1914 and 1990 there were 116 occasions on which various countries imposed economic sanctions. Two-thirds of these failed to achieve their stated goals. The cost to the country imposing sanctions can be large, particularly when it is acting unilaterally. It is estimated that in 1995 imposing sanctions on other countries cost the US economy over $15 billion in lost exports and 200,000 in lost jobs in export industries.</p><p>Widely considered a notable success was the use of economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa, although some economists question how big a part the sanctions actually played. Clearly important was the fact that the sanctions were imposed multilaterally by the international community, so there were comparatively few breaches of the restrictions. But, arguably, the most crucial factor in persuading the South African government to cave in was that foreign companies, fearing that their <small>SHARE PRICE</small> would fall because their investments in South Africa would attract bad publicity, voluntarily chose for commercial reasons to disinvest.</p><p>The failure of economic sanctions to deliver regime change in Iraq was used as one justification for the US-led invasion of the country in 2003. However, economic sanctions against Iran are believed to have had some effect in getting it to sign a deal in 2015 promising not to develop nuclear weapons. Sanctions were also imposed on Russia in 2014 following its seizure of territory in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>efficient market hypothesis</h2>
<p>You can’t beat the market. The efficient market hypothesis says that the <small>PRICE</small> of a financial <small>ASSET</small> reflects all the <small>INFORMATION</small> available and responds only to unexpected news. Thus prices can be regarded as optimal estimates of true <small>INVESTMENT</small> value at all times. It is impossible for investors to predict whether the price will move up or down (future price movements are likely to follow a <small>RANDOM WALK</small>), so on average an investor is unlikely to beat the market. This belief underpins <small>ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY</small>, the <small>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL</small> and concepts such as <small>BETA</small>.</p><p>The hypothesis had few critics among financial economists during the 1960s and 1970s, but it has come under increasing attack since then and intensified following the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, which seemed to prove to many people just how inefficient markets could be. The fact that financial prices were far more volatile than appeared to be justified by new information, and that financial <small>BUBBLES</small> sometimes formed, led economists to question the theory. <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small> has challenged one of the main sources of market <small>EFFICIENCY</small>, the idea that all investors are fully rational <i>Homo economicus.</i> Some economists have noted the fact that information gathering is costly, so it is unlikely that all available information will be reflected in prices. Others have pointed to the fact that <small>ARBITRAGE</small> can become more costly, and thus less likely, the further away from fundamentals prices move. The efficient market hypothesis is now one of the most controversial and well-studied propositions in <small>ECONOMICS</small>, although no consensus has been reached on which markets, if any, are efficient.</p>

If they are <small>SUBSTITUTE GOODS</small> (tea and coffee), the cross-elasticity will be positive – an increase in the price of tea will increase demand for coffee. If they are <small>COMPLEMENTARY GOODS</small> (tea and teapots), the cross-elasticity will be negative. If they are unrelated (tea and <small>OIL</small>), the cross-elasticity will be zero.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Elasticity of substitution describes how easily one input in the production process, such as <small>LABOUR</small>, can be substituted for another, such as machinery.</span></li></ul><p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<h2>environmental economics</h2>
<p>Some people think <small>CAPITALISM</small> is wholly bad for the environment as it is based on consuming scarce resources. They want less <small>CONSUMPTION</small> and greater reliance on renewable resources. They oppose <small>FREE TRADE</small> because they favour self-sufficiency (<small>AUTARKY</small>), or at least so-called <small>FAIR TRADE</small>, and because they believe it encourages poorer countries to destroy their natural resources in order to get rich quick. Although few professional economists would share these views, in recent years many attempts have been made to incorporate environmental concerns within mainstream <small>ECONOMICS</small>.</p><p>The traditional measure of <small>GDP</small> incorporates only those things that are paid for; this may include things that reduce the overall quality of life, including harming the environment. For instance, cleaning up an <small>OIL</small> spill will increase GDP if people are paid for the clean-up. Attempts have been made to devise an alternative environmentally friendly measure of <small>NATIONAL INCOME</small>, but so far progress has been limited. At the very least, traditional economists increasingly agree that maximising GDP <small>GROWTH</small> does not necessarily equal maximising social <small>WELFARE</small>.</p><p>Much of the damage done to the environment may be a result of externalities. An <small>EXTERNALITY</small> can arise when people engaged in economic activity do not have to take into account the full costs of what they are doing. For instance, car drivers do not have to bear the full cost of making their contribution to global warming, even though their actions may one day impose a huge financial burden on society.</p><p>One way to reduce externalities is to tax them, for example through a fuel tax. Another is prohibition, for example limiting car drivers to one gallon of fuel per week. This could result in black markets, however. Allowing trade in pollution rights may encourage “efficient pollution”, with the pollution permits ending up in the hands of those for which pollution has the greatest economic upside. As this still allows some environmental destruction, it is unpopular with extreme greens. Trading in carbon emissions was introduced within the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> in 2005 to help meet targets agreed in the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. After initial problems, the trading regime was strengthened in 2008. Other carbon-emissions trading schemes, mostly local and voluntary, have been launched elsewhere, including in the US. Many economists argue that a tax is more efficient at curbing carbon emissions than a trading system. Yet the practical difficulties of creating a global carbon tax may make carbon-emissions trading the best practical option. The international agreement to reduce carbon emissions reached in Paris in 2015 included provisions to increase carbon trading.</p><p>There may be a case for international eco markets. For instance, people in rich countries might pay people in poor countries to stop doing activities that cause environmental damage outside the poor countries, or that rich people disapprove of, such as chopping down the rain forests. The new jargon for this type of payment is “buying ecosystem services”. Choices on environmental policy, notably on measures to reduce the threat of global warming, involve costs today with benefits delayed until the distant future.</p><p>How are these choices to be made? Traditional <small>COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</small> does not help much. In measuring costs and benefits in the far distant future, two main things seem to intervene and spoil the conventional calculations. One is uncertainty. We know nothing about what the state of the world will be in 2200. The other is how much people today are willing to pay to raise the welfare of others who are so remote that they can barely be imagined, yet who seem likely to be much better off materially than people today. Some economists take the view that the welfare of each future generation should be given the same weight in the analysis as the welfare of today’s generation. This implies that a much lower <small>DISCOUNT RATE</small> should be used than the one appropriate for short-term projects. Another option is to use a high discount rate for costs and benefits arising during the first 30 or so years, then a lower rate or rates for more distant periods. Many studies by economists and psychologists have found that people do indeed discount the distant future at lower rates than they apply to the near future.</p>

<h2>equity</h2>
<p>There are two definitions in <small>ECONOMICS</small>:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">The <small>CAPITAL</small> of a firm, after deducting any liabilities to outsiders other than shareholders, who are typically the legal owners of the firm’s equity. This ownership right is the reason <small>SHARES</small> are also known as equities.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Fairness. Dividing up the economic pie. Economists have been particularly interested in this with regard to how systems of <small>TAXATION</small> work. They have examined whether taxes treat fairly people with the same ability to pay (<small>HORIZONTAL EQUITY</small>) and people with different abilities to pay (<small>VERTICAL EQUITY</small>).</span></li></ul><p>The fairness of other aspects of how the gains from economic activity are distributed through society has also been debated by economists, especially those interested in <small>WELFARE ECONOMICS</small>. Some economists start with the presumption that the free-market outcome is inherently inequitable, and that equity (sharing out the pie) must be traded off against <small>EFFICIENCY</small> (maximising the size of the pie). Others argue that it is inequitable to take money away from someone who has created economic value to give to people who have been less skilled or industrious. Some economists argue that unequal outcomes in terms of <small>INCOME</small> and wealth may be fair and equitable if people start out with equal opportunities, but not if they do not.</p>

<h2>equity risk premium</h2>
<p>The extra reward investors get for buying a <small>SHARE</small> over what they get for holding a less risky <small>ASSET</small>, such as a <small>GOVERNMENT BOND</small>. Modern financial theory assumes that the premium will be just big enough on average to compensate the investor for the extra <small>RISK</small>. However, studies have found that the <small>AVERAGE</small> equity premium over many years has been much larger than appears to be justified by the average riskiness of shares. To solve this so-called equity premium puzzle, some economists have suggested that investors may have greater risk aversion towards shares than traditional theory assumes. Some claim that the past equity premium was mismeasured, or reflected an unrepresentative sample of share prices. Some suggest that the high premium is evidence that the <small>EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS</small> does not apply to the stockmarket. Some think that the premium fell to more easily explained levels during the 1990s. Nobody really knows which, if any, of these interpretations is right.</p>

<h2>ethical consumerism</h2>
<p>Shopping with a conscience. In recent years, pressure from consumers and <small>NGO</small>s has led to a growing number of products being labelled according to their ethical as well as their physical ingredients. These standards were initially set by NGOs, although increasingly they are taking the form of an agreed “compact” between NGOs and industry groups. For instance, <small>FAIR TRADE</small> coffee has been produced according to agreed standards on <small>WAGES</small> and sustainability. Some paper products have been made in accordance with standards on the protection of rain forests. Some fish are identified as being caught in accordance with sustainable fishing standards. Initially, ethically branded products cost more than similar products not produced according to the agreed standards; however, as ethical consumerism becomes increasingly mainstream, that <small>PRICE</small> differential is starting to narrow thanks, in part, to <small>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</small>.</p>

<h2>exchange rate</h2>
<p>The <small>PRICE</small> at which one currency can be converted into another. Over the years, economists and politicians have often changed their minds about whether it is a good idea to try to hold a country’s exchange rate steady, rather than let it be decided by <small>MARKET FORCES</small>. For two decades after the second world war, many of the major currencies were fixed under the <small>BRETTON WOODS</small> agreement. During the following two decades the number of currencies allowed to float increased, although in the late 1990s a number of European currencies were permanently fixed under <small>ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION</small> and some other countries established <small>CURRENCY BOARDS</small>.</p><p>When <small>CAPITAL</small> can flow easily around the world, countries cannot fix their exchange rate and at the same time maintain an independent <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>. They must choose between the confidence and stability provided by a fixed exchange rate and the control over <small>INTEREST RATE</small> policy offered by a floating exchange rate. On the face of it, in a world of capital <small>MOBILITY</small> a more flexible exchange rate seems the best bet. A floating currency will force firms and investors to <small>HEDGE</small> against fluctuations, not lull them into a false sense of stability. It should make foreign <small>BANKS</small> more circumspect about lending. At the same time it gives policymakers the option of devising their own monetary policy. But floating exchange rates have a big drawback: when moving from one <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small> to another, currencies can overshoot and become highly unstable, especially if large amounts of capital flow in or out of a country, perhaps because of <small>SPECULATION</small> by investors. This instability has real economic costs.</p><p>To get the best of both worlds, many emerging economies have tried a hybrid approach, loosely tying their exchange rate either to a single foreign currency, such as the dollar, or to a basket of currencies. But the currency crises of the late 1990s, and the failure of Argentina’s currency board, led many economists to conclude that, if not a currency union such as the <small>EURO</small>, the best policy may be to have a freely floating exchange rate.</p>

<h2>exogenous</h2>
<p>Outside the model. For instance, in traditional <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> models of <small>GROWTH</small> rely on an exogenous factor. To keep growing, an economy needs continual infusions of technological progress. Yet this is a force that the neo-classical model makes no attempt to explain. The rate of technological progress comes from outside the model; it is simply assumed by the economic modellers. In other words, it is exogenous. New growth theory tries to calculate the rate of technological progress inside the economic model by mapping its relationship to factors such as <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>, free markets, <small>COMPETITION</small> and <small>GOVERNMENT</small> expenditure. Thus, in these models, growth is endogenous.</p>

<h2>export credit</h2>

<h2>externality</h2>
<p>An economic side-effect. Externalities are costs or benefits arising from an economic activity that affect somebody other than the people engaged in the economic activity and are not reflected fully in <small>PRICES</small>. For instance, smoke pumped out by a factory may impose clean-up costs on nearby residents; bees kept to produce honey may pollinate plants belonging to nearby farmers, thus boosting their crops. Because these costs and benefits do not form part of the calculations of the people deciding whether to go ahead with the economic activity they are a form of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>, since the amount of the activity carried out if left to the free market will be an inefficient use of resources. If the externality is beneficial, the market will provide too little; if it is a cost, the market will supply too much.</p><p>One potential solution is <small>REGULATION</small>: a ban, say. Another, when the externality is negative, is a tax on the activity or, if the externality is positive, a <small>SUBSIDY</small>. Another approach is to issue limited rights to do an activity that may be traded, such as has been attempted with carbon emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol to deal with the externality of climate change.</p><p>For economists, for a solution to externalities to be efficient, ideally it should require them to be included in the costings of those engaged in the economic activity, so there is self-regulation. For instance, the externality of pollution can be addressed by creating <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small> over clean air, entitling their owner to a fee if they are infringed by a factory pumping out smoke. According to the Coase theorem (named after Ronald Coase, a Nobel Prize-winning economist), it does not matter who has ownership, so long as property rights are fully allocated and completely <small>FREE TRADE</small> of all property rights is possible. Some economists think that using tax as a means to include the cost of externalities in economic decision-making is more efficient than the property rights approach.

<h2>fair trade</h2>
<p>Many politicians and <small>NGOS</small> argue that <small>FREE TRADE</small> is not enough; it should also be fair. On the face of it, fairness is self-evidently a good thing. However, fairness, in trade as in beauty, lies in the eye of the beholder. Frédéric Bastiat, a 19-century French satirist, once observed that the sun offered unfair <small>COMPETITION</small> to candlemakers. If windows could be boarded up during the day, he argued, more jobs could be created making candles. US trade <small>UNIONS</small> complain that Mexicans’ lower <small>WAGES</small> give them an unfair advantage. Mexicans say they cannot compete fairly against more productive US counterparts. Both sides are wrong. Mexicans are paid less than Americans largely because they are, in general, less productive. There is nothing unfair about that; indeed, it helps to make trade mutually beneficial. The mutual benefits of trade also disprove the fair traders’ other complaint, that free trade harms poor countries. (See <small><a href="#name.097">COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</a></small>.)</p><p>Some rich countries complain that trade is unfair when foreign exporters are subsidised by their <small>GOVERNMENTS</small>, allowing them to engage in alleged <small>DUMPING</small> of their <small>OUTPUT</small> in rich-country markets. The evidence suggests that this happens far less often than is alleged, and anyway tends to benefit consumers in rich countries far more than it hurts producers there.</p><p>One meaning of fair trade that can have a beneficial effect is “fair trade” labelling of products, such as coffee, which are produced in ways that meet acceptable standards on wages and sustainability. Although there is debate about what exactly these standards should be, this form of label is an important component of <small>ETHICAL CONSUMERISM</small>, and need not involve the sort of regulatory costs that can arise from trying to impose fair trade through government policy.</p>

The <small>WORLD BANK</small> has described financial inclusion as one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty, as it lets poor people more easily borrow money to run a business, better protect their savings and manage <small>RISKS</small> such as crop failure more effectively.</p><p>Traditionally, the way that <small>BANKS</small> are regulated has discouraged them from serving poor people, and they have been unconvinced that there is a fortune at the <small>BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID</small> to be made from having them as customers. However, there are hopes that new digital money, such as <small>BITCOIN</small>, and other financial apps will rapidly reduce the cost of providing financial services to poor people, and that financial inclusion will increase rapidly as the use of smartphones spreads across the developing world. Including the financially excluded in rich countries may prove to be a more challenging proposition, as the reasons people do not have access to affordable financial services in countries where they are abundant are complex and hard to solve.</p>

<h2>financial literacy</h2>

Research into why so many <small>SUBPRIME</small> mortgages went into default, triggering the crisis, found that many borrowers did not understand the <small>RISKS</small> involved when they took out their mortgage, including such basics as the fact that their monthly payments would rise if the <small>INTEREST RATE</small> went up. The bankers who invested in <small>BONDS</small> backed by subprime mortgages did not seem to have a significantly better grasp of the risks.</p><p>A seminal survey in 2004 by Cambridge University and Prudential, a big insurer, found that some 9 million Britons are “financially phobic”, meaning that “they shy away from anything to do with financial <small>INFORMATION</small>, from <small>BANK</small> statements to <small>SAVINGS</small> accounts to life assurance”. Another survey soon after found that one-quarter of British adults did not realise that their <small>PENSIONS</small> were invested in the stockmarket.</p><p>Perhaps financial illiteracy is a key reason for the widespread irrational behaviour identified by <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small>. That is why economists increasingly argue that financial literacy should be a core component of the education curriculum, perhaps for children aged five or even younger. (Another option may be to design financial products in ways that make them easier for financially illiterate people to understand.) When it comes to learning about how <small>MONEY</small> makes the world go round, you can’t start too early. That said, most of the studies done by behavioural economists of efforts to teach financial literacy have found little evidence of a sustained improvement in financial decision-making. Improving financial literacy must start with improving how people are taught about money.</p>

<h2>fine tuning</h2>
<p>A favourite <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policy in the <small>KEYNESIAN</small>-dominated 1950s and 1960s, involving frequent adjustments to fiscal policy and/or <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> to alter the level of <small>DEMAND</small> to keep the economy growing at a steady rate. The trouble was and is, partly because of the inadequacies of economic <small>FORECASTING</small>, that these frequent adjustments were and often are mistaken, making the economy’s <small>GROWTH</small> path more, rather than less, erratic. In the 1990s, fine tuning was increasingly shunned by <small>CENTRAL BANKS</small> and governments, which stopped trying to manage short-term demand and instead aimed to pursue long-term macroeconomic goals, which required fewer adjustments to policy. Or so they claimed. In practice, there continued to be some attempted fine tuning.</p>

<h2>firms</h2>
<p>For many years, economists had little interest in what happened inside firms, preferring instead to examine the workings of the different sorts of industries in which firms operate, ranging from <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> to <small>MONOPOLY</small>. Since the 1960s, however, sophisticated economic theories of how firms work have been developed. These have examined why firms grow at different rates and tried to model the normal life cycle of a company, from fast-growing start-up to lumbering mature business. The aim is to explain when it pays to conduct an activity within a firm and when it pays to externalise it through short- or long-term arrangements with outsiders, be they individuals, exchanges or other companies. The theories also look at the economic consequences of the different incentives influencing individuals working within companies, tackling issues such as pay, <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> and corporate <small>GOVERNANCE</small> structures.</p>

<h2>first-mover advantage</h2>

<h2>fiscal drag</h2>
<p>A nice little earner for the state. Fiscal drag is the tendency of revenue from <small>TAXATION</small> to rise as a share of <small>GDP</small> in a growing economy. Tax allowances, progressive tax rates and the threshold above which a particular rate of tax applies usually remain constant or are changed only gradually. By contrast, when the economy grows, <small>INCOME</small>, spending and corporate <small>PROFITS</small> rise. So the tax-take increases too, without any need for <small>GOVERNMENT</small> action. This helps slow the rate of increase in <small>DEMAND</small>, reducing the pace of <small>GROWTH</small>, making it less likely to result in higher <small>INFLATION</small>. Thus fiscal drag is an automatic stabiliser, as it acts naturally to keep demand stable.</p>

<h2>fiscal neutrality</h2>
<p>When the net effect of <small>TAXATION</small> and <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> neither boosts nor reduces <small>DEMAND</small> in an economy. The term can be used to describe the overall stance of <small>FISCAL POLICY</small>: a balanced <small>BUDGET</small> is neutral, as total tax revenue equals total public spending. It can also refer more narrowly to the combined impact of new measures introduced in an annual budget: the budget can be fiscally neutral if any new taxes equal any new spending, even if the overall stance of the budget either boosts or slows demand.</p>

<h2>fiscal policy</h2>
<p>One of the two instruments of <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY; MONETARY POLICY’S</small> side-kick. It comprises <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and <small>TAXATION</small>, and any other <small>GOVERNMENT INCOME</small> or assistance to the private sector (such as tax breaks). It can be used to influence the level of <small>DEMAND</small> in the economy, usually with the twin goals of getting <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> as low as possible without triggering excessive <small>INFLATION</small>. At times it has been deployed to manage short-term demand through <small>FINE TUNING</small>, although since the end of the <small>KEYNESIAN</small> era it has more often been targeted at long-term goals, with monetary policy more often used for shorter-term adjustments.</p><p>For a government, there are two main issues in setting fiscal policy: what should be the overall stance of policy, and what form should its individual parts take?</p><p>Some economists and policymakers argue for a <small>BALANCED BUDGET</small>. Others say that a persistent <small>DEFICIT (PUBLIC SPENDING</small> exceeding revenue) is acceptable provided, in accordance with the <small>GOLDEN RULE</small>, the deficit is used for <small>INVESTMENT</small> (in <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>, say) rather than <small>CONSUMPTION</small>. However, there may be a danger that public-sector investment will result in the <small>CROWDING OUT</small> of more productive private investment. Whatever the overall stance on average over an economic cycle, most economists agree that fiscal policy should be counter-cyclical, aiming to automatically stabilise demand by increasing public spending relative to revenue when the economy is struggling and increasing taxes relative to spending towards the top of the cycle. For instance, social (<small>WELFARE</small>) handouts from the state usually increase during tough times, and <small>FISCAL DRAG</small> boosts government revenue when the economy is growing.</p><p>As for the bits and pieces making up fiscal policy, one debate is about how high public spending should be relative to <small>GDP</small>. In the US and many Asian countries, public spending has tended to be less than 30% of GDP; in European countries, such as Germany and Sweden, it is typically in the region of 40–50%. Some economic studies suggest that lower public spending relative to GDP results in higher rates of <small>GROWTH</small>, though this conclusion is controversial. Certainly, over the years, much public spending has been highly inefficient.</p><p>Another issue is the form that taxation should take, especially the split between <small>DIRECT TAXATION</small> and <small>INDIRECT TAXATION</small> and between <small>CAPITAL</small>, income and expenditure tax.</p><p>The <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 reopened the debate about the relative merits of monetary policy and fiscal policy in reviving an economy during a <small>RECESSION</small> or <small>DEPRESSION</small>. Despite many economists continuing to argue that monetary policy offered the best way to boost the economy fast, by cutting <small>INTEREST RATES</small>, some governments also implemented massive programmes of fiscal stimulus. This included the US government, although everything about the Obama administration’s stimulus policy remains the subject of fierce debate among economists, including how big it was, whether it was too big or not big enough, whether the extra government spending went on the right things (not enough on <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>, some say), how important it was relative to other policies such as the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE’S QUANTITATIVE EASING</small> rounds, or, ultimately, whether it made much difference at all. In other countries, where questions arose about the government’s ability to borrow additional money without provoking a sovereign <small>DEBT</small> crisis, <small>AUSTERITY</small> measures to tighten fiscal policy were adopted to reassure the markets. The pros and cons of these policies, too, remain the subject of fierce debate.</p>

<h2>foreign direct investment (FDI)</h2>
<p>Investing directly in production in another country, either by buying a company there or by establishing new operations of an existing business. This is done mostly by companies as opposed to financial institutions, which prefer indirect <small>INVESTMENT</small> abroad such as buying small parcels of a country’s supply of <small>SHARES</small> or <small>BONDS</small>. Foreign direct investment (FDI) grew rapidly, starting in the 1990s, before falling along with the global economy following the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008. As of 2013, cross-border capital flows globally were still below their peak in 2007. Most of this investment went from one <small>OECD</small> country to another, but the share going “south-south” to <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>, especially in Asia, has increased steadily.</p><p>There was a time when economists considered FDI as a substitute for trade. Building factories in foreign countries was one way of jumping <small>TARIFF BARRIERS</small>. Now economists typically regard FDI and trade as complementary. For example, a firm can use a factory in one country to supply neighbouring markets. Some investments, especially in <small>SERVICES</small> industries, are essential prerequisites for selling to foreigners. Who would buy a Big Mac in London if it had to be sent from New York?</p><p><small>GOVERNMENTS</small> used to be highly suspicious of FDI, often regarding it as corporate imperialism. Nowadays they are more likely to court it – often going so far as to agree to investor-protection clauses in investment or trade treaties that in some respects give foreign investors stronger rights than a country’s own citizens. They hope that investors will create jobs, and bring expertise and technology that will be passed on to local <small>FIRMS</small> and workers, helping to sharpen up their whole economy. Furthermore, unlike financial investors, multinationals generally invest directly in plant and equipment. Since it is hard to uproot a chemicals factory, these investments, once made, are far more enduring than the flows of <small>HOT MONEY</small> that whisk in and out of emerging markets.</p><p><small>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</small> are a significant form of FDI. For instance, in the pre-crash peak year of 2007, 92% of the $277 billion of FDI into the US took the form of mergers rather than of setting up new subsidiaries and opening factories.</p>

<h2>free riding</h2>
<p>Getting the benefit of a good or service without paying for it, not necessarily illegally.

Another way to look at this may be that the good or service has a positive <small>EXTERNALITY</small>. However, there can sometimes be a free-rider problem, if the number of people willing to pay for the good or service is not enough to cover the cost of providing it. In this case, the good or service might not be produced, even though it would be beneficial for the economy as a whole to have it. Public goods are often at risk of free riding; in their case, the problem can be overcome by financing the good by imposing a tax on the entire population.</p>

<h2>free trade</h2>
<p>The ability of people to undertake economic transactions with people in other countries free from any restraints imposed by <small>GOVERNMENT</small> or other regulators. Measured by the volume of <small>IMPORTS</small> and <small>EXPORTS</small>, world trade has become increasingly free in the years since the second world war. The volume of world merchandise trade at the start of the 21st century was about 17 times what it was in 1950, and the world’s total <small>OUTPUT</small> was not even six times as big. The ratio of world exports to <small>GDP</small> had more than doubled since 1950. Of this, trade in manufactured goods was worth three times the value of trade in <small>SERVICES</small>, although the share of services trade was growing fast.</p><p>A fall in barriers to trade, as a result of the <small>GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</small> and its successor, the <small>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</small> (WTO), has helped stimulate this growth. After the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, following initial signs of a backlash against free trade, there were fresh efforts to complete the WTO’s stalled Doha Round of trade <small>LIBERALISATION</small>, as well as proposed regional initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. There was also a sharp rise in bilateral trade agreements designed to increase trade between the two signatory countries; economists tend to find that the benefits of bilateral trade deals are far smaller than those arising from regional or better still multilateral agreements, and in so far as they take the energy out of negotiations of bigger deals, they may even have negative consequences.</p><p>For economists, the benefits of free trade are explained by the theory of <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small>, with each country doing those things in which it is comparatively more efficient. As long as each country specialises in products in which it has a comparative advantage, trade will be mutually beneficial. Some critics of free trade argue that trade with <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>, where <small>WAGES</small> are usually lower and working hours longer than in developed countries, is unfair and will wipe out jobs in high-wage countries. They want <small>AUTARKY</small> or <small>FAIR TRADE</small>.</p><p>Real-world trade patterns sometimes seem to challenge the theory of comparative advantage (see <small><a href="#name.430">NEW TRADE THEORY</a></small>). Most trade occurs between countries that do not have huge cost differences. The US’s biggest trading partner, for instance, is Canada. Well over half the exports from France, Germany and Italy go to other <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> countries. Moreover, these countries sell similar things to each other: cars made in France are exported to Germany, and German cars go to France. The main reason seems to be cross-border differences in consumer tastes. But the agricultural exports of Australia, say, or Saudi Arabia’s reliance on <small>OIL</small>, clearly stem from their particular stock of natural resources. Also poorer countries often have more unskilled labour, so they export simple manufactures such as clothing.</p>

<h2>Friedman, Milton</h2>
<p>Loved and loathed, and perhaps the most influential economist of his generation. He won the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small> in 1976, one of many <small>CHICAGO SCHOOL</small> economists to receive that honour. Friedman, who died in 2006 aged 94, was recognised for his achievements in the study of <small>CONSUMPTION</small>, monetary history and theory, and for demonstrating how complex policies aimed at economic <small>STABILISATION</small> can be.</p><p>A fierce advocate of free markets, Friedman argued for <small>MONETARISM</small> at a time when <small>KEYNESIAN</small> policies were dominant. Unusually, his work is readily accessible to the layman. He argued that the problems of <small>INFLATION</small> and short-run <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> would be solved if the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small> had to increase the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> at a constant rate.</p><p>Like Adam <small>SMITH</small> and Friedrich <small>HAYEK</small>, who inspired him, Friedman praised the free market not just for its economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small> but also for its moral strength. He saw freedom – economic, political and civil – as an end in itself, not a means to an end. It is what makes life worthwhile. He said he would prefer to live in a free country, even if it did not provide a higher standard of living, than a country run by an alternative regime. However, the likelihood of a free country being poorer than an unfree one struck him as implausible; the economic as well as the moral superiority of free markets is, he declared, “now proven”.</p><p>An adviser to Richard Nixon, he was disappointed when the president went against the spirit of monetarism in 1971 by asking him to urge the chairman of the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply more rapidly. The 1980s economic policies of Margaret Thatcher and General Pinochet were inspired – and defended – by Friedman. However, in 2003, he admitted that one of those policies, the targeting of the money supply, had “not been a success” and that he doubted he would “as of today push it as hard as I once did”.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member,” quipped Groucho Marx. But the world’s politicians are desperate to join the economic clubs that are the Group of Seven (G7), G8, G10 and so on. Being a member shows that, economically speaking, your country matters. Alas, beyond making politicians feel good, there has not been much evidence in recent years that they do anything useful, apart from letting <small>GOVERNMENT</small> officials and journalists talk to each other about <small>ECONOMICS</small> and politics, usually in beautiful locations with lots of fine food and drink on hand. Even so, they are considered to be a key part of the system of <small>GOVERNANCE</small> for the global economy.</p><p>In 1975, six countries, the world’s leading capitalist countries, ranked by <small>GDP</small>, were represented in France at the first annual summit meeting: the US, the UK, Germany, Japan and Italy, as well as the host country. The following year they were joined by Canada and, in 1977, by representatives of the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small>, although the group continued to be known as the G7. At the 1989 summit, 15 developing countries were also represented, although this did not give birth to the G22, which was not set up until 1997 and swiftly grew into the G33. At the 1991 G7 summit, a meeting was held with the Soviet Union, a practice that continued (with Russia) in later years. In 1998, although it was not one of the world’s eight richest countries, Russia became a full member of the G8 (only to be thrown out in 2014 after it illegally occupied parts of Ukraine). Meetings of the <small>IMF</small> are attended by the G10, which includes 11 countries – the original members of the G7 as well as representatives of Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. In 2003, 21 developing countries, representing half of the world’s population and two-thirds of its farmers, formed the G21 to lobby for more <small>FREE TRADE</small> in <small>AGRICULTURE</small>.</p><p>With the growing importance in the global economy of countries other than the traditional rich industrialised nations, the importance of the G8 has declined, but at the same time there has been a rise in the significance of discussions at the G20. Formed in 1999, the G20 brings together 19 countries and the EU, which together account for 90% of global GDP, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the people on earth, and thus is much more representative of the global economy than all the other Gs.</p>

<h2>game theory</h2>
<p>How to win at Twister? No, but maybe at Monopoly. Game theory is a technique for analysing how people, <small>FIRMS</small> and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> should behave in strategic situations (in which they must interact with each other), and in deciding what to do must take into account what others are likely to do and how others might respond to what they do. For instance, <small>COMPETITION</small> between two firms can be analysed as a game in which firms play to achieve a long-term <small>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</small> (perhaps even a <small>MONOPOLY</small>). The theory helps each firm to develop its optimal strategy for, say, pricing its products and deciding how much to produce; it can help the firm to anticipate in advance what its competitor will do and shows how best to respond if the competitor does something unexpected. It is particularly useful for understanding behaviour in <small>MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION</small>.</p><p>In game theory, which can be used to describe anything from wage negotiations to arms races, a dominant strategy is one that will deliver the best results for the player, regardless of what anybody else does. One finding of game theory is that there may be a large <small>FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE</small> for companies that beat their rivals into a new market or come up with an <small>INNOVATION</small>. One special case identified by the theory is the <small>ZERO-SUM GAME</small>, where players see that the total winnings are fixed; for some to do well, others must lose. Far better is the positive-sum game, in which competitive interaction has the potential to make all the players richer. Another problem analysed by game theorists is the <small>PRISONERS’ DILEMMA</small>. (See also <small><a href="#name.415">NASH EQUILIBRIUM</a></small>.)</p>

<h2>GDP</h2>
<p>Gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity in a country. It is calculated by adding the total value of a country’s annual <small>OUTPUT</small> of goods and <small>SERVICES</small>. GDP = private <small>CONSUMPTION</small> + <small>INVESTMENT</small> + <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> + the change in inventories + (<small>EXPORTS</small> – <small>IMPORTS</small>). It is usually valued at market <small>PRICES</small>; by subtracting indirect tax and adding any <small>GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY</small>, however, GDP can be calculated at <small>FACTOR COST</small>. This measure more accurately reveals the <small>INCOME</small> paid to <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small>. Adding income earned by domestic residents from their investments abroad, and subtracting income paid from the country to investors abroad, gives the country’s gross national product (GNP).</p><p>The effect of inflation can be eliminated by measuring GDP <small>GROWTH</small> in constant real prices. However, some economists argue that hitting a nominal GDP target should be the main goal of <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small>. This is because it would remind policymakers to take into account the effect of their decisions on inflation, as well as on growth.</p><p><small>GDP</small> can be calculated in three ways. The income method adds the income of residents (individuals and <small>FIRMS</small>) derived from the production of goods and services. The output method adds the value of output from the different sectors of the economy. The expenditure method totals spending on goods and services produced by residents, before allowing for <small>DEPRECIATION</small> and <small>CAPITAL</small> consumption. As one person’s output is another person’s income, which in turn becomes expenditure, these three measures ought to be identical. They rarely are because of statistical imperfections. Furthermore, the output and income measures exclude unreported economic activity that takes place in the <small>BLACK ECONOMY</small>, but that may be captured by the expenditure measure.</p><p>Some people dislike GDP as an objective of economic policy because it is not a perfect measure of societal <small>WELFARE</small>. It does not include aspects of the good life such as some leisure activities. Nor does it include economically valuable activities that are not paid for, such as parents teaching their children to read. But it does include some things that lower the quality of life, such as activities that damage the environment. The <small>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX</small> was launched in 1990 by the <small>UN</small> as a better measure of a country’s performance, but it is highly correlated with GDP, unlike the broader <small>SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX</small>, launched in 2013. Since the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and subsequent <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>, there has been a broader recognition of the limitations of GDP, and a growing fascination with an idea first proposed in Bhutan in 1972: to try to measure gross national happiness.</p>

<h2>general equilibrium</h2>
<p>Economic perfection, while it lasts. This is when <small>DEMAND</small> and <small>SUPPLY</small> are in balance (the market is in <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>) for each and every good and service in the economy. Nobody thinks that real-world economies can ever be that perfect; at best there is “partial equilibrium”. But most economists think that general equilibrium is something worth aspiring to.</p>

<h2>generational accounting</h2>
<p>A relatively new way of analysing <small>FISCAL POLICY</small> by identifying the financial costs and benefits of <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policies to people of different ages, now living or yet to be born. Fiscal policy can distribute resources between different generations, sometimes deliberately and often inadvertently. At any moment in time, one generation may be in work and paying taxes that support other generations (those at school or retired) that are not working. Over its lifetime, one generation’s mix of taxes paid and benefits received may differ sharply from that of another generation. Politicians are often tempted to ignore the needs of future generations (who, clearly, cannot vote at the time) in order to win the support of current generations, for instance by borrowing heavily to fund current spending. More fundamentally, because it incorporates all the tax and spending, current and future, to which a government is committed, generational accounting is a much better guide to whether fiscal policy is sustainable than measures such as the <small>BUDGET DEFICIT</small>, which looks only at taxes and spending in the current year.</p>

<h2>gig economy</h2>
<p>No, not an economy made up solely of pop stars. The gig economy is shorthand for the notion that, increasingly, work will be short-term and temporary in nature, as traditional, secure, long-term salaried jobs are made obsolete by technology, <small>GLOBALISATION</small> and changing employer and employee preferences. As the share of freelancers in the workforce has edged higher in some countries, including the US and UK, there has been growing debate among economists over whether this is largely a good thing, allowing greater flexibility and worker choice, or the start of an alarming dystopian future in which insecure workers fight with increasing desperation for poorly paid piece work. Others argue that not much has really changed if you look closer at the data.</p>

<h2>Gini coefficient</h2>
<p>An <small>INEQUALITY</small> indicator. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality of <small>INCOME</small> distribution within a country. It varies from zero, which indicates perfect equality, with every household earning exactly the same, to one, which implies absolute inequality, with a single household earning a country’s entire income. Latin America is the world’s most unequal region, with a Gini coefficient of around 0.5; in rich countries the figure is closer to 0.3. In many developed economies, the Gini coefficient has started to rise again, having fallen for several decades after the second world war.</p>

<h2>global goals</h2>
<p>In 2000, the member states of the <small>UN</small> adopted eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) designed to accelerate economic development in poorer countries by 2015. Progress towards the goals was uneven; a 50% reduction in the number of people living in extreme <small>POVERTY</small> was achieved, but not the goals for universal primary education and environmental sustainability. In 2015, a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was adopted, most of them for 2030. There were more of these new goals, 17, with 169 associated targets. They also applied to rich as well as <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>.</p><p>Some critics argued that there were too many SDGs to inspire the sort of focused effort associated with the MDGs. Others argued that setting goals in this way makes little or no difference, and that the seeming progress achieved by the MDGs owed little to their existence but was instead the result of established <small>LONG-RUN</small> trends in the global economy. There is general agreement, however, that on current trends the SDGs are unlikely to be achieved unless substantial resources are allocated to them.</p>

<h2>globalisation</h2>
<p>The trend for people, <small>FIRMS</small> and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> around the world to become increasingly dependent on and integrated with each other. This can be a source of tremendous opportunity, as new markets, workers, business partners, goods and <small>SERVICES</small> and jobs become available, but also of competitive threat, which may undermine economic activities that were viable before globalisation.</p><p>The term first surfaced during the 1980s to characterise huge changes that were taking place in the international economy, notably the <small>GROWTH</small> in international trade and in flows of <small>CAPITAL</small> around the world. Globalisation has also been used to describe growing <small>INCOME INEQUALITY</small> between the world’s rich and poor; the growing power of multinational companies relative to national governments; and the spread of <small>CAPITALISM</small> into former communist countries. Usually, the term is synonymous with international integration, the spread of free markets and policies of <small>LIBERALISATION</small> and <small>FREE TRADE</small>. The process is not the result simply of economic forces. The decisions of policymakers have also played an important part, although not all governments have embraced the change warmly.</p><p>The driving force of globalisation has been multinational companies, which since the 1970s have constantly, and often successfully, lobbied governments to make it easier for them to put their skills and capital to work in previously protected national markets. Firms enjoying some national protection, and their (often unionised) workers, have been some of the main opponents of globalisation, along with advocates of <small>FAIR TRADE</small>. In recent years, critics of globalisation have focused increasingly on firms <small>OUTSOURCING</small> (or, more accurately, offshoring) jobs to cheaper workers abroad. Mainstream economists have also started to focus on the price paid for globalisation. Dani Rodrik, for instance, has pointed out that greater economic integration cannot be compatible with maintaining national sovereignty and democracy, what he calls the inescapable “trilemma” of the world economy.</p><p>Despite all the talk of rising globalisation during the 1990s, in some respects the world economy was more integrated in the late 19th century. The <small>LABOUR</small> market was certainly more global. For example, the flow of people out of Europe, 300,000 people a year in the mid-19th century, reached 1 million a year after 1900. Now governments are much fussier about immigration, and people are no longer free to migrate as they wish. As for <small>CAPITAL MARKETS</small>, only in the 1990s did international capital flows, relative to the size of the world economy, recover to the levels of the few decades before the first world war.</p><p>This early globalised economy did not last for long, however. Between the two world wars, the flows of trade, capital and people collapsed to a trickle. Even before the first world war, governments started to put up the shutters against migrants and <small>IMPORTS</small>. Could such a backlash against globalisation happen again? During the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, there was much talk of globalisation reversing and some empirical evidence to support that claim. Both trade and cross-border capital flows fell below levels reached in 2007. Since then, however, by most measures globalisation has begun to rise once again.</p>

<h2>gold</h2>
<p>For much of human history gold has been an important ingredient of economic activity. But its importance declined during the 20th century and may continue to shrink in future. The <small>GOLD STANDARD</small>, which fixed <small>EXCHANGE RATES</small> to the value of gold during the 19th and early 20th centuries, has been long abandoned. <small>CENTRAL BANKS</small>, which in 2000 still owned 30,000 tonnes, over one-quarter of all the gold ever mined, no longer feel a need to have large <small>RESERVES</small> of the metal to support the value of their currency. It does not pay them any <small>INTEREST</small>, though they may earn a little by lending it to bullion dealers. So they have started to sell.</p><p><small>GOVERNMENTS</small> and investors have traditionally held gold as a <small>HEDGE</small> against <small>INFLATION</small> and to provide security at times of international crisis. But its role as a store of value has been tarnished. During the 1980s and 1990s, the value of gold generally failed to keep pace with inflation. The <small>LIQUIDITY</small> of gold is also less than that of a foreign currency, so it cannot as easily be used for foreign exchange intervention in defence of a currency under attack. In short, gold is no longer a monetary <small>ASSET</small>. It has become just another commodity, although so-called gold-bugs still believe that it remains the thing to have at times of soaring <small>INFLATION</small> or financial turmoil and uncertainty – which is why its <small>PRICE</small> soared during the global economic crisis that began in 2007, rising to an all-time high of $1,921 an ounce in 2011, before falling sharply again as confidence in the economic system returned and fears of inflation remained muted.</p>

<h2>gold standard</h2>
<p>A monetary system in which a country backs its currency with a reserve of <small>GOLD</small>, and allows currency holders to exchange their notes and coins for gold. For many years up to 1914, most of the world’s leading currencies had their <small>EXCHANGE RATE</small> determined by the gold standard. The economic disruption resulting from the first world war led the combatants to abandon the link to gold. The UK (with others) returned to the gold standard in 1925, before quitting it for good in 1931. The widespread use of the gold standard ended during 1930–33 as a result of global <small>DEPRESSION</small> and large cuts in international lending. The US left the gold standard in 1933 and partially returned to it in 1934. After the second world war, a limited form of gold standard continued but only directly applied to the dollar; other major currencies had their exchange rate fixed to the dollar under the <small>BRETTON WOODS</small> arrangements. The dollar was finally cut loose from the gold standard in 1971.</p>

<h2>governance</h2>
<p>The way in which something – a family, a firm, a country, the planet – is governed. This is of growing interest to economists, as they understand better the importance of different sorts of institutional arrangements and incentives, and of the social ties that bind them. The <small>BRETTON WOODS</small> conference was a notable effort to establish effective global governance of the economy, though following the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 there is widespread agreement that global governance needs urgently to be modernised. Similarly, economists who once regarded <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> or financial <small>REGULATION</small> as essentially technical activities now study the governance implications of different <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> or regulatory arrangements among countries; and although they tended to view <small>FIRMS</small> as something of a black box, they now study different corporate governance arrangements to identify the best ways to reduce <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> and other incentive challenges. In general, though not always, economists find that governance systems based on clear rules and <small>TRANSPARENCY</small> perform better than those that are informal and opaque.</p>

<h2>government</h2>
<p>There are few more hotly debated topics in <small>ECONOMICS</small> than what role the state should play in the economy. Plenty of economists provided intellectual support for state intervention during the era of big government, particularly from the 1930s to the 1980s. <small>KEYNESIANS</small> argued that the state should manage the amount of <small>DEMAND</small> in the economy to maintain <small>FULL EMPLOYMENT</small>. Others advocated a <small>COMMAND ECONOMY</small>, in which the government would set <small>PRICES</small>, oversee the allocation of scarce resources and run the most important parts of the economy (the “commanding heights”) or, in communist countries, the entire economy. The role of the state increased at the expense of <small>MARKET FORCES</small>. Economists provided plenty of examples of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small> that seemed to justify this.</p><p>From the 1950s onwards there was growing evidence that government intervention could also be flawed, and often imposed even greater costs on an economy than market failure. One reason is that when a government acts, it usually does so as a <small>MONOPOLY</small>, with all the attendant economic inefficiencies this implies.</p><p>In practice, policies of Keynesian demand management often resulted in <small>INFLATION</small>, and thus lost much of their credibility. There was growing concern that public <small>INVESTMENT</small> was <small>CROWDING OUT</small> superior private investment, and that other <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> on things such as health care, education and <small>PENSIONS</small> was similarly discouraging private provision. Government management of commercial enterprises was often seen to be inefficient and, starting in the 1980s, <small>NATIONALISATION</small> gave way to <small>PRIVATISATION</small>. Even when the state was not directly responsible for economic activity, but instead set the rules governing private behaviour, there was evidence of <small>REGULATORY FAILURE</small>. High rates of <small>TAXATION</small> started to discourage people and companies from undertaking economic activities that would, without the tax, have been profitable; wealth creation suffered.</p><p>Most economists agree that there is a need for some government role in the economy. A market economy can function only if there is an adequate legal system, and, in particular, clearly defined, enforceable <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small>. The legal system is probably an example of what economists call a <small>PUBLIC GOOD</small> (although the existence in many countries and industries of some self-regulation shows it is not always so).</p><p>Although politicians in many countries spent most of the period since 1980 talking about the need to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and in many cases introduced policies of privatisation, <small>DEREGULATION</small> and <small>LIBERALISATION</small> to help this happen, public spending continued to increase as a share of <small>GDP</small>. Within the <small>OECD</small>, public spending accounted for a larger slice of GDP in 2008 than in 1990, which was in turn higher than in 1980. Indeed, it has risen during every decade since the start of the 20th century. One reason was that governments had to honour spending commitments on pensions and health care made by previous generations of politicians.</p><p>In the aftermath of the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, there was much talk of a new era of activist government. Vast sums of money were pumped into the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> to shore it up, and some governments even moved towards the nationalisation of some banks by buying <small>SHARES</small> in them. Government spending soared in many countries as fiscal stimulus packages sought to prevent sharp declines in economic activity. There was also a significant increase in <small>REGULATION</small> of the financial system, especially of <small>RISK</small>-taking activities by banks. In large part, this expansion of government was the result of necessity. Yet it also reflected a change in the intellectual climate in some parts of the world, as faith declined sharply in the abilities of business leaders, especially those working in the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>, and the public turned for solutions to politicians. The multi-trillion-dollar question, which remains very much alive, was whether these politicians had learnt anything from past government failures so that government would not only become bigger but also better.</p>

<h2>Great Moderation</h2>
<p>For about two decades starting in the mid-1980s there was a sharp decline in macroeconomic <small>VOLATILITY</small>, particularly in the US. During that period, the variability of quarterly <small>GROWTH</small> in real <small>OUTPUT</small> declined by half, and the variability of quarterly <small>INFLATION</small> declined by about two-thirds. James Stock, a Harvard economist, coined the phrase “Great Moderation” in 2002 to describe this flattening of the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small>, and two years later it was popularised in a speech by Ben Bernanke, who went on to serve as chairman of the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small> during 2006.

<h2>Great Recession</h2>
<p>The period of severe economic slowdown in much of the world in the years following the financial <small>CRASH</small> of September 2008. It earned the “Great” for being much the worst slowdown in the developed world since the second world war. But although it was worse in some places (parts of the <small>EURO ZONE</small>) than others (the US economy), it was not nearly as deep or as painful as the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small> of the 1930s.</p><p>The likely causes of the downturn remain the subject of much disagreement among economists, as does why <small>GROWTH</small> resumed so much more sluggishly than after previous downturns. In the US, the Great Recession began before the crash, in December 2007, as a <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> took hold and the housing market slowed, and ended in June 2009. <small>GDP</small> in <small>REAL TERMS</small> did not return to pre-<small>RECESSION</small> levels until late in 2010. UK GDP did not surpass its pre-recession peak of January 2008 until May 2014, when France and several other continental European economies still had not reached that milestone of economic recovery.</p><p>Some economists attribute the slow recovery to inadequate monetary and/or fiscal stimulus, especially in countries that adopted <small>AUSTERITY</small> measures. Others point out that the nature of the downturn was fundamentally different from earlier recessions, which had been triggered by high <small>INTEREST RATES</small> set to slow growth and squeeze <small>INFLATION</small> out of the economy. By contrast, the Great Recession was brought on by the bursting of a <small>BUBBLE</small> in the <small>DEBT</small> market, which required many <small>FIRMS</small>, households and even <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> to rebuild their <small>BALANCE SHEETS</small> and confidence rather than stimulating the economy with increased spending, which had been the result of the interest rate cuts introduced in response to the earlier recessions.</p><p>Whatever the disagreements among economists, it seems clear that the existence of extensive <small>WELFARE</small> safety nets in most countries, along with a co-ordinated global economic policy response by governments, at the very least ensured that despite sluggish recovery and extremely high rates of <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> in some countries, the second Great Depression that seemed likely in the scary weeks after the crash did not come to pass.</p>

<h2>growth</h2>
<p>An increase in economic activity, but how can it be made to happen? And is it always a good thing? Economists have plenty of theories, but none of them has all the answers.</p><p>Adam <small>SMITH</small> attributed growth to the <small>INVISIBLE HAND</small>, a view shared by most followers of <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS. NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> had a different theory of <small>GROWTH</small>, devised by Robert Solow during the 1950s. This argued that a sustained increase in <small>INVESTMENT</small> increases an economy’s growth rate only temporarily: the ratio of <small>CAPITAL</small> to <small>LABOUR</small> goes up, the <small>MARGINAL</small> product of capital declines and the economy moves back to a long-term growth path. <small>OUTPUT</small> will then increase at the same rate as the growth in the workforce (quality-adjusted, in later versions) plus a factor to reflect improvements in <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small>.</p><p>This theory predicts specific relationships among some basic economic statistics. Yet some of these predictions fail to fit the facts. For example, income disparities among countries are greater than the differences in their <small>SAVINGS</small> rates would suggest. Moreover, although the model says that economic growth ultimately depends on the rate of technological change, it fails to explain exactly what determines this rate. Technological change is treated as <small>EXOGENOUS</small>.</p><p>Some economists argued that doing this ignored the main engine of growth. They developed a new growth theory, in which improvements in productivity were <small>ENDOGENOUS</small>, meaning that they were the result of things taking place within the economic model being used and not merely assumed to happen, as in the neo-classical models. Endogenous growth was due, in particular, to technological <small>INNOVATION</small> and investments in <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>. In looking for explanations for differences in rates of growth, including between rich and <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>, the new growth theory concentrates on what the incentives are in an economy to create additional human capital and to invent new products.</p><p>Factors determining these incentives include <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policies. Countries with broadly free-market policies, in particular <small>FREE TRADE</small> and the maintenance of secure <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small>, typically have higher growth rates. Open economies have grown much faster on average than closed economies. Higher <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> relative to <small>GDP</small> is generally associated with slower growth. Also bad for growth are high <small>INFLATION</small> and political instability.</p><p>As countries grew richer during the 20th century, annual growth rates declined as a result of <small>DIMINISHING RETURNS</small> on capital. By 1990, most developed countries reckoned to have long-term trend growth rates of 2–2.5% a year. However, during the 1990s, growth rates started to rise, especially in the US. Some economists said this was the result of the birth of a new economy based on a revolution in productivity, largely because of rapid technological innovation but also (perhaps directly stemming from the spread of new technology) to increases in the value of human capital.</p><p>Some economists argue that growth is actually a bad thing, especially if it involves the unsustainable use of resources or endangers life on the planet by polluting or warming the atmosphere. This remains a minority view among economists. More popular, especially since the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, is the view that the pursuit of growth for its own sake is not a good idea, and that increases in GDP should be judged using other measures, such as the Human Development Index and the <small>SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX</small>.</p>

<h2><i>hawala</i></h2>
<p>An ancient system of moving <small>MONEY</small> based on <small>TRUST</small>. It predates Western <small>BANK</small> practices, though new privately issued cyber-currencies, such as <small>BITCOIN</small>, have some similar attributes. Now more associated with the Middle East, <i>hawala</i> existed in China in the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907) and was known as <i>fei qian,</i> or flying money. In <i>hawala,</i> no money moves physically between locations; these days it is transferred by means of a telephone call, fax or e-mail between dealers in different countries. No legal contracts are involved, and recipients are given only a code number or simple token, such as a low-value banknote torn in half, to prove that money is due.

<h2>Hayek, Friedrich</h2>
<p>An influential economist of the Austrian school, who won the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small> in 1974 for his theory of the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small> many years after this body of work seemed to have been disproved by <small>KEYNES</small>. Born in 1899, Hayek attended his home-town University of Vienna after the first world war. He was attracted to <small>SOCIALISM</small> until he read a pioneering Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, on the subject, after which, he said, “the world was never the same again”.</p><p>Hayek argued that the business cycle originated from expanded <small>CREDIT CREATION</small> by <small>BANKS</small>, which was followed by <small>FIRMS</small> and people making mistaken <small>CAPITAL INVESTMENTS</small> in producing things for which the market turns out to be smaller (or larger) than expected. But after an initially enthusiastic reception, the Austrian business-cycle theory lost out in policy debates to Keynes’s General Theory. After the second world war, Hayek was a leading member of the Chicago school along with Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small>, among others.</p><p>Hayek was a noted proponent of the free-market system and a critic of state planning. His 1944 book, <i>The Road to Serfdom,</i> anticipated the demise of <small>COMMAND ECONOMIES</small> that sought to suppress <small>PRICE</small> signals. This prediction came from his belief in the limits of human reason and his faith in the superior ability of <small>CAPITALISM</small> to make efficient use of limited <small>INFORMATION</small> and to learn by trial and error. His views, which echo Adam <small>SMITH’S INVISIBLE HAND</small>, are said to have inspired the free-market economic reforms undertaken in the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. He died in 1992.</p>

<h2>hedge</h2>
<p>Reducing your <small>RISKS</small>. Hedging involves deliberately taking on a new risk that offsets an existing one, such as your exposure to an adverse change in an <small>EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE</small> or <small>COMMODITY PRICE</small>. Imagine, for example, that you are British and you are to be paid $1 million in three months’ time. You are worried that the dollar may have fallen in value by then, thus reducing the number of pounds you will be able to convert the $1 million into. You can hedge away that currency risk by buying $1 million-worth of pounds at the current exchange rate (in effect) in the futures market. Hedging is most often done by commodity producers and traders, financial institutions and, increasingly, by non-financial <small>FIRMS</small>.</p><p>It used to be fashionable for firms to hedge by following a policy of <small>DIVERSIFICATION</small>. More recently, firms have hedged using <small>FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</small> and <small>DERIVATIVES</small>. Another popular strategy is to use “natural” hedges wherever possible. For example, if a company is setting up a factory in a particular country, it might finance it by borrowing in the currency of that country. An extension of this idea is operational hedging – for example, relocating production facilities to get a better match of costs in a given currency to revenue.</p><p>Hedging sounds prudent, but some economists reckon that firms should not do it because it reduces their value to shareholders. In the 1950s, two economists, Merton Miller (1923–2000) and Franco Modigliani (1918–2003), argued that firms make <small>MONEY</small> only if they make good <small>INVESTMENTS</small>, the kind that increase their operating cash flow. Whether these investments are financed through <small>DEBT, EQUITY</small> or retained earnings is irrelevant. Different methods of financing simply determine how a firm’s value is divided between its various sorts of investors (for example, shareholders or bondholders), not the value itself. This surprising insight helped win each of them a <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>. If they are right, there are big implications for hedging. If methods of financing and the character of financial risks do not matter, managing them is pointless. It cannot add to the firm’s value; on the contrary, as hedging does not come free, doing it might actually lower that value. Moreover, argued Miller and Modigliani, if investors want to avoid the financial risks attached to holding shares in a firm, they can diversify their portfolio of shareholdings. Firms need not manage their financial risks; investors can do it for themselves. Few managers agree.</p>

<h2>hedge funds</h2>
<p>These bogey-men of the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> are often blamed, usually unfairly, when things go wrong – most recently for helping to turn the <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> of 2007 into a full-blown global economic crisis by <small>SHORTING</small> (and naked shorting) <small>BANK SHARES</small>. There is no simple definition of a hedge fund (few of them actually hedge). But they all aim to maximise their absolute <small>RETURNS</small> rather than relative ones; that is, they concentrate on making as much <small>MONEY</small> as possible, not (like many mutual funds) simply on outperforming an index. Although they are often accused of disrupting financial markets by their speculation, their willingness to bet against the herd of other investors may push security <small>PRICES</small> closer to their true fundamental values, not away. The amount of money invested in hedge funds grew rapidly from the early 1990s until 2008, when many funds went out of business as investors took their money back to avoid further losses. The financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 proved to be a boon for some hedge-fund firms, which profited by shorting the banks, which turned out to be the weakest link in the financial sector rather than, as had been predicted by many commentators, the hedge funds. By 2015, hedge funds managed around $2.7 trillion, nearly 90% more than at the end of 2008.</p>

<h2>Herfindahl-Hirschman index</h2>
<p>A warning signal of possible <small>MONOPOLY. ANTITRUST</small> economists often gauge the <small>COMPETITIVENESS</small> of an industry by measuring the extent to which its <small>OUTPUT</small> is concentrated among a few <small>FIRMS</small>. One such measure is a Herfindahl-Hirschman index. To calculate it, take the market share of each firm in the industry, square it, then add them all up. If there are 100 equal-sized firms (a market with close to <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small>), the index is 100. If there are four equal-sized firms (possible <small>OLIGOPOLY</small>), it will be 2,500. The higher the Herfindahl number, the more concentrated is market power.</p><p>The main virtue of the Herfindahl is its simplicity. But it has two unfortunate shortcomings. It relies on defining correctly the industry or market for which the degree of competitiveness is open to question. This is rarely simple and can be a matter of fierce debate. Even when the scope of the market is clear, the relation between the Herfindahl and market power is not. When there is a <small>CONTESTABLE MARKET</small>, even a firm with a Herfindahl of 10,000 (the classic definition of a monopoly) may behave as if it was in a perfectly competitive market.</p>

<h2>house prices</h2>
<p>When they go through the roof it is usually a warning sign that an economy is overheating. House prices often rise after <small>INTEREST RATE</small> reductions, which lower mortgage payments and thus give buyers the ability to fund a larger amount of borrowing and so offer a higher <small>PRICE</small> for their new home. Strangely, people often regard house-price <small>INFLATION</small> as good news, even though it creates as many losers as gainers. They argue that rising house prices help to boost consumer confidence and are part of the <small>WEALTH EFFECT</small>: as house prices rise, people feel wealthier and so spend more. However, against this must be set a negative wealth effect. An increase in house prices makes many people worse off, such as first-time buyers and anyone planning to trade up to a better property. A fall in house prices, such as the one that followed the bursting of the housing <small>BUBBLE</small> in the US ahead of the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, can have severe economic consequences – for consumers, for investors who fund mortgages and also for <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small>, who often use their homes as <small>COLLATERAL</small> for loans they take out to fund new businesses. Indeed, over-exposure to housing <small>DEBT</small> was one of the causes of the 2008 crash and subsequent <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>.</p><p>As long as people think that their house is a vehicle for <small>SPECULATION</small>, rather than merely accommodation, it seems inevitable that prices will be volatile, prone to a boom-bust cycle. As house prices rise, profits are made, tempting more speculative buyers into the market; eventually, they start to pay too much, interest rates rise, <small>DEMAND</small> falls and prices plunge. People have also invested in housing as a <small>HEDGE</small> against <small>INFLATION</small>: house prices generally rise when other prices rise, whereas the value of mortgage <small>DEBT</small> in <small>REAL TERMS</small> is eroded by inflation. But when mortgage interest rates are variable (as they generally are in the UK) rather than fixed (as they often are in the US), they may rise painfully during times of high inflation as a result of <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> efforts to slow economic <small>GROWTH</small>.</p><p>One of the reasons the US has long-term fixed mortgage rates (as well as variable rate mortgages) is the financing provided by <small>GOVERNMENT</small>-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, nicknamed, respectively, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Even before the crash of 2008, which led to Fannie and Freddie being bailed out by the government, and with increasing certainty after it, some economists argued that these sorts of quasi-governmental economic institutions had brought a false confidence to the housing market and thereby become a huge source of <small>RISK</small> in the global <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>. Yet, though now something of a shadow of their old selves, they are still around.</p>

<h2>human capital</h2>
<p>The stuff that enables people to earn a living. Human capital can be increased by investing in education, training and health care. Economists increasingly argue that the accumulation of human as well as physical <small>CAPITAL</small> (plant and machinery) is a crucial ingredient of economic <small>GROWTH</small>, particularly in the <small>NEW ECONOMY</small>. Even so, this conclusion is largely a matter of theory and faith, rather than the result of detailed empirical analysis. Economists have made little progress in solving the tricky problem of how to measure human capital, even within the same country over time, let alone for comparisons between countries. Spending on, say, education is not necessarily a good indicator of how much human capital an education system is creating; indeed, some economists argue that higher education spending may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of a country becoming wealthy. Nevertheless, even modest estimates of the stock of human capital in most countries suggest that it would pay to greatly increase <small>INVESTMENT</small> in medical technologies that would extend the working lives of most people. The non-economic benefits would be worth having, too.</p>

<h2>Human Development Index</h2>
<p>A pioneering measure of how far a country is lifting its people up the human development ladder. Devised in 1990 by a Pakistani economist, Mahbub ul Haq, with help from other economists including Nobel Prize-winner Amartya Sen, the index is published annually as part of the UN Human Development Report. It combines data on three main topics: income per head, education and life expectancy. Its goal, which it has certainly achieved, is to show that there is more to human development than simply increasing per-head <small>GDP</small>. That said, critics note that its rankings tend to be highly correlated with those based on per-head GDP alone, and that the non-financial measures it uses are themselves too narrow; there is more to human development than income, education and longevity.</p>

<h2>hyperinflation</h2>
<p>Very, very bad. Although people debate when, precisely, rapid <small>INFLATION</small> turns into hyperinflation (a 100% or more increase in <small>PRICES</small> a year, perhaps?) nobody questions that it wreaks huge economic damage. After the first world war, German prices at one point were rising at a rate of 23,000% a year before the country’s economic system collapsed, creating a political opportunity grasped by the Nazis. In former Yugoslavia in 1993, prices rose by around 20% a day. In July 2008, Zimbabwe’s official inflation rate reached an astonishing 231,000,000%. Typically, hyperinflation quickly leads to a complete loss of confidence in a country’s currency, and causes people to search for other forms of <small>MONEY</small> that are a better store of value. These may include physical <small>ASSETS, GOLD</small> and foreign currency. Hyperinflation might be easier to live with if it were stable, as people could plan on the basis that prices would rise at a fast but predictable rate. However, there are no examples of stable hyperinflation, precisely because it occurs only when there is a crisis of confidence across the economy, with all the behavioural unpredictability this implies.</p>

<h2>hypothecation</h2>
<p>Earmarking taxes for a specific purpose. It may be a clever way to get around public hostility to paying more in <small>TAXATION</small>. If people are told that a specific share of their <small>INCOME TAX</small> will go to some popular cause, say education or health, they may be more willing to cough up. At the very least they may be forced to make more informed decisions about the trade-offs between taxes and public <small>SERVICES</small>. There is a downside, however. Hypothecated taxes may tie the hands of a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> at times when the hypothecated revenue could be spent to better effect elsewhere in the public sector. Conversely, and perhaps more likely, hypothecated taxes may prove to be less hypothecated than the public is led to believe. Civil servants, doubtless under pressure from their political bosses, can usually find ways to fudge the definition of the specific purpose for which a tax is hypothecated, letting government regain control over how the money is spent.</p>

<h2>hysteresis</h2>
<p>Lagging, slow to respond. Traditionally, economists believed that high <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> was a cyclical phenomenon. Eventually, unemployment would cause people to lower their wage demands, and so new job opportunities would arise and unemployment would fall. More recently, however, economists have suggested that some unemployed people, especially the long-term jobless, can display hysteresis. They find it hard, perhaps impossible, to return to work, even when jobs become available. For instance, unemployed workers may gradually lose the motivation, self-confidence or the self-discipline needed to get to the workplace and fulfil job requirements. Or their skills may become outdated and redundant. State benefits for the jobless may contribute to this hysteresis by making it easier for them to stay out of work.</p>

From the 1980s onwards, the ILO approach came under attack as attention turned to the costs of high labour standards, notably slower economic <small>GROWTH</small>.

<h2>IMF</h2>
<p>Short for International Monetary Fund, the referee and, when the need arises, rescuer of the world’s <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>. The IMF was set up in 1944 at <small>BRETTON WOODS</small>, along with the <small>WORLD BANK</small>, to supervise the newly established fixed <small>EXCHANGE RATE</small> system. After this fell apart in 1971–73, the IMF became more involved with its member countries’ economic policies, doling out advice on <small>FISCAL POLICY</small> and <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> as well as microeconomic changes such as <small>PRIVATISATION</small>, of which it became a forceful advocate. In the 1980s, it played a leading part in sorting out the problems of <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>’ mounting debt. More recently, it has several times co-ordinated and helped to finance assistance to countries with a currency crisis.</p><p>The Fund has been criticised for the <small>CONDITIONALITY</small> of its support, which is usually given only if the recipient country promises to implement IMF-approved economic reforms. Unfortunately, the IMF has often approved “one size fits all” policies that, not much later, turn out to be inappropriate. However, it cannot force a country to do anything, unless the country decides to accept its <small>MONEY</small>. The IMF has also been accused of creating <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>, in effect encouraging <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> (and <small>FIRMS, BANKS</small> and other investors) to behave recklessly by giving them reason to expect that if things go badly the Fund will organise a bail-out. Indeed, some financiers have described an <small>INVESTMENT</small> in a financially shaky country as a “moral-hazard play” because they were so confident that the Fund would ensure the safety of their money, one way or another.</p><p>Following the economic crisis in Asia during the late 1990s, and again after the crisis in Argentina in the early 2000s, some policymakers argued (to no avail) for the IMF to be abolished, as the absence of its safety net would encourage more prudent behaviour all round. More sympathetic folk argued that the IMF should evolve into a global <small>LENDER OF LAST RESORT</small>. Following the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, the IMF came to be seen once again as one of the most important institutions of <small>GOVERNANCE</small> in the global economy, playing a crucial role in co-ordinating the response of governments, including policies of fiscal stimulus and <small>QUANTITATIVE EASING</small>. It also played a central role in negotiations that led to a series of bail-outs designed to prevent the sovereign <small>DEBT</small> crisis forcing the Greek government to default or even quit the <small>EURO</small>.</p>

<h2>income tax</h2>
<p>A much-loathed method of <small>TAXATION</small> based on earnings. It was first collected in 1797 by the Dutch Batavian Republic. In the UK it was introduced in 1799 as a “temporary” measure to finance a war against Napoleon, abolished in 1816 and reintroduced, forever, in 1842. In most countries, people do not pay it until their <small>INCOME</small> exceeds a minimum threshold, and richer people pay a higher rate of income tax than poorer people. Since the 1980s, the unpopularity with voters of high rates of income tax and concern that high rates discourage valuable economic activity have led many <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> to reduce income-tax rates. However, this has not necessarily reduced the amount of total revenue collected in income tax (see <small><a href="#name.346">LAFFER CURVE</a></small>). Nor do governments that have reduced income-tax rates always cut other sorts of taxes; on the contrary, they have often increased them sharply to make up for any revenue lost as a result of lower rates of income tax.</p>

<h2>index numbers</h2>
<p>Economists love to compile indices aggregating lots of individual data, so they can analyse broad trends in the behaviour of an economy. <small>INFLATION</small> is measured by an index of consumer (retail) <small>PRICES</small>. There are indices of all sorts of things that are bought and sold, of which perhaps the best-known are <small>SHARE</small> price indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or FTSE 100. The main challenges in compiling an index are what to include in it and what weight to give the different things that are included. A particularly tricky question is how to change an index over time. Measures of inflation are based on the price of a basket of things bought by a typical consumer. As the quality and choice of products in the basket change over time, the inflation index ought to take this into account. How, exactly, is much debated.</p>

<h2>inequality</h2>
<p>Does economic <small>GROWTH</small> create more or less equality? Do unequal societies grow more or less slowly than equal ones? Economists have debated these questions for as long as anyone can remember. One problem is to agree which sort of inequality matters: equality of outcome (that is, <small>INCOME</small> or wealth) or of opportunity? Another is how to measure it. Equality of opportunity, which, in theory, should make a difference to growth, because it is about giving people the chance to make the most of their <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>, is probably beyond the ability of statisticians to analyse rigorously. The most often used measure of income inequality is the <small>GINI COEFFICIENT</small>.</p><p>The evidence suggests that extreme <small>POVERTY</small> is more likely to slow growth than income inequality itself. This is because very poor people cannot buy the education they need to enable them to become richer and their children may be forced to forgo schooling in order to work for <small>MONEY</small>.</p><p>Until recently, the evidence also suggested that economic growth tended to reduce inequality within a country. This has been partly as a result of redistributive tax and benefits systems, which have become so significant that they may now be causing slower growth in some countries. The availability of <small>WELFARE</small> benefits may have discouraged unemployed people from seeking out a better job; and the high taxes needed to pay for the benefits may have discouraged some wealthy people from working as hard as they would have done under a friendlier tax regime. However, from the mid-1990s, inequality in rich countries began to widen significantly because of an increasingly winner-takes-all distribution of financial rewards.</p><p>This growing inequality prompted political debate, particularly with regard to the soaring pay of corporate bosses. After the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, as many people struggled to cope with the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>, the rich generally prospered more than ever, not least because the favoured pro-recovery policies of low <small>INTEREST RATES</small> and rebuilding the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> pushed up the value of financial <small>ASSETS</small>, of which the rich held a disproportionate share. Public anger over rising inequality found expression in the global #occupy movement, whose claim that a growing share of economic power was held by the richest “one percent” (more accurately, the richest 0.01%) was backed up by detailed empirical work by economists such as Thomas Piketty, whose book, <i>Capital,</i> became an unexpected bestseller. Politicians in many countries have adopted increasingly populist “bash the rich” rhetoric, though beyond promising modest tax increases, credible policies to seriously reduce inequality of income remain noticeable mainly by their absence. Despite widespread dislike of the richest beneficiaries of this widening inequality, the lesson learnt during previous eras of wealth confiscation and punitive <small>TAXATION</small>, that such policies drive away the <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small> who create the new wealth a country needs to pay for its welfare system, has not been forgotten. Yet.</p>

<h2>inflation</h2>
<p>Rising prices, across the board. Inflation means less bang for your buck, as it erodes the purchasing power of a unit of currency. Inflation usually refers to <small>CONSUMER PRICES</small>, but it can also be applied to other prices (wholesale goods, <small>WAGES, ASSETS</small>, and so on). It is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate of change on an <small>INDEX NUMBER</small>. For much of human history inflation has not been an important part of economic life. Before 1930, prices were as likely to fall as rise during any given year, and in the <small>LONG RUN</small> these ups and downs usually cancelled each other out. By contrast, by the end of the 20th century, 60-year-old Americans had seen prices rise by over 1,000% during their lifetime. The most spectacular period of inflation in industrialised countries took place during the 1970s, partly as a result of sharp increases in <small>OIL</small> prices implemented by the <small>OPEC CARTEL</small>. Although these countries have mostly regained control over inflation since the 1980s, it continued to be a source of serious problems in many <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>.</p><p>Inflation would not do much damage if it were predictable, as everybody could build into their decision-making the prospect of higher prices in future. In practice, it is unpredictable, which means that people are often surprised by price increases. This reduces economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small>, not least because people take fewer risks to minimise the chances of suffering too severely from a <small>PRICE SHOCK</small>. The faster the rate of inflation, the harder it is to predict future inflation. Indeed, this uncertainty can cause people to lose confidence in a currency as a store of value. This is why <small>HYPERINFLATION</small> is so damaging.</p><p>Most economists agree that an economy is most likely to function efficiently if inflation is low. Ideally, <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> should aim for stable prices. Some economists argue that low inflation can be a good thing, however, if it is a result of <small>INNOVATION</small>. New products are launched at high prices, which quickly come down through <small>COMPETITION</small>. Most economists reckon that <small>DEFLATION</small> (falling <small>AVERAGE</small> prices) is best avoided.</p><p>To keep inflation low you need to know what causes it. Economists have plenty of theories but no absolutely cast-iron conclusions. Inflation, Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small> once said, “is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Monetarists reckon that to stabilise prices the rate of <small>GROWTH</small> of the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> needs to be carefully controlled. However, implementing this has proven difficult, as the relationship between measures of the money supply identified by monetarists and the rate of inflation has typically broken down as soon as policymakers have tried to target it. <small>KEYNESIAN</small> economists believe that inflation can occur independently of monetary conditions. Other economists focus on the importance of institutional factors, such as whether the <small>INTEREST RATE</small> is set by politicians or (preferably) by an independent <small>CENTRAL BANK</small>, and whether that central bank is set an <small>INFLATION TARGET</small>.</p><p>Is there a relationship between inflation and unemployment? In the 1950s, the <small>PHILLIPS CURVE</small> seemed to indicate that policymakers could trade off higher inflation for lower <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. Later experience suggested that although inflating the economy could lower unemployment in the short run, in the long run you ended up with unemployment at least as high as before and rising inflation as well. Economists then came up with the idea of the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), the rate of unemployment below which inflation would start to accelerate. However, in the late 1990s, in both the US and the UK, the unemployment rate fell well below what most economists thought was the NAIRU yet inflation did not pick up. This caused some economists to argue that technological and other changes wrought by the <small>NEW ECONOMY</small> meant that inflation was dead. Others argued that sound <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>, including low inflation targets, had led the public to lower their inflation expectations, which in turn helped to lower inflation as people no longer automatically demanded much higher wages or set much higher prices as they had done when they expected high inflation. Traditionalists said it was merely resting.</p><p>In the years of the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, central bankers worried at least as much about the threat of deflation as about the possibility of inflation picking up again. Indeed, the experience of Japan, whose central bank had been struggling since long before the crash to stimulate <small>DEMAND</small> by enough to rekindle inflation, became a nightmare scenario capable of giving central bankers in many other countries sleepless nights.</p>

<h2>inflation target</h2>
<p>The goal of <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> in many countries is to ensure that <small>INFLATION</small> is neither too high nor too low. It became fashionable during the 1990s to set a country’s <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> an explicit rate of inflation to target. By 1998, some 54 central banks had an inflation target, compared with just eight at the end of 1990, the year in which New Zealand’s Reserve Bank became the first to be set a target. In most industrialised countries, the target, or, typically, the mid-point of a target range, for consumer-price inflation is between 1% and 2.5%. The reasons it is not zero are that official price indices overstate inflation and that these countries would prefer a little inflation to any <small>DEFLATION</small>.</p><p>Monetary policy takes time to have an impact. So central banks usually base their policy changes on a forecast of inflation, not its current rate. If forecast inflation in two years’ time, say, is above the target, <small>INTEREST RATES</small> are raised. If it is below target, rates are cut.</p><p>Why have an inflation target? Setting one usually goes hand-in-hand with allowing a central bank considerable discretion in setting policy, so <small>TRANSPARENCY</small> in its decision-making is crucial and is therefore usually increased as part of the process of adopting a target. More fundamentally, by making it easier to judge whether policy is on track, an inflation target makes it easier to hold a central bank to account for its performance. The pay of central bankers can be designed to reward them for achieving the target. But some central bankers argue that an inflation target restricts their policy flexibility too much, which is one reason the world’s most powerful central bank, the US <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small>, has argued (so far successfully) against having one.</p><p>Although for most of the past two decades <small>CONSUMER PRICES</small> have performed broadly in line with the target in countries that have them, some economists argue that targeting consumer prices distracted central bankers from the broader problem of controlling <small>ASSET PRICES</small>, a failure which ultimately led to a <small>BUBBLE</small> and, in turn, to the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>.</p>

<h2>information</h2>
<p>The oil that keeps the economy working smoothly. Economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small> is likely to be greatest when information is comprehensive, accurate and cheaply available. Many of the problems facing economies arise from people making decisions without all the information they need. One reason for the failure of the <small>COMMAND ECONOMY</small> is that <small>GOVERNMENT</small> planners were not good at gathering and processing information. Adam <small>SMITH’S</small> metaphor of the <small>INVISIBLE HAND</small> is all about how, in many cases, free markets are much more efficient at processing information on the needs of all the participants in an economy than is the visible, and often dead, hand of state planners. <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small>, when one party to a deal knows more than the other party, can be a serious source of inefficiency and <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>. Uncertainty can also impose large economic costs. The internet, by greatly increasing the availability and lowering the <small>PRICE</small> of information, is helping to boost economic efficiency (see <small><a href="#name.042">BIG DATA</a></small>). But there are inefficiencies the internet will not be able to solve. Uncertainty will remain a huge source of economic inefficiency. Alas, potentially the most useful information, about what will happen in the future, is never available until it is too late.</p>

<h2>infrastructure</h2>
<p>The economic arteries and veins. Roads, ports, railways, airports, power lines, pipes and wires that enable people, goods, commodities, water, energy and <small>INFORMATION</small> to move about efficiently. Increasingly, infrastructure is regarded as a crucial source of economic <small>COMPETITIVENESS</small>. Investment in infrastructure can yield unusually high <small>RETURNS</small> because it increases people’s choices: of where to live and work, what to consume, what sort of economic activities to carry out, and of other people to communicate with. Some parts of a country’s infrastructure may be a natural <small>MONOPOLY</small>, such as water pipes. Others, such as traffic lights, may be <small>PUBLIC GOODS</small>. Some may have a <small>NETWORK EFFECT</small>, such as telephone cables. Each of these factors has encouraged <small>GOVERNMENT</small> provision of infrastructure, albeit sometimes with the familiar downsides of state intervention: bad planning, inefficient delivery and <small>CORRUPTION</small>. Investing in infrastructure was a central plank of many fiscal stimulus programmes launched by governments around the world after the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, though given the low-<small>INTEREST-RATE</small> environment that persisted throughout the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> and into the recovery, some economists have argued that governments (including that of the US) should have taken advantage of abundant cheap credit to borrow far more heavily to finance the modernisation of their infrastructure.</p>

<h2>innovation</h2>
<p>A vital contributor to economic <small>GROWTH</small>. The big challenge for <small>FIRMS</small> and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> is to make it happen more often. Although nobody is entirely sure why innovation takes place, new theories of <small>ENDOGENOUS</small> growth try to model the innovation process, rather than just assume it happens for unexplained, <small>EXOGENOUS</small> reasons. The role of incentives seems to be particularly important. Although some innovations are the result of scientists and others engaging in the noble pursuit of knowledge, most, especially their commercial applications, are the result of <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small> seeking <small>PROFIT</small>. Joseph <small>SCHUMPETER</small> described this as a process of “creative destruction”. A firm innovates successfully and is rewarded with unusually high profits, which in turn encourages rivals to come up with a superior innovation.</p><p>To encourage innovation, innovators must be allowed to make a profit, otherwise they will not incur the <small>RISK</small> and expense of trying to come up with useful innovations. Most countries have <small>PATENTS</small> and other laws protecting <small>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</small>, which allow innovators to enjoy a (usually temporary) <small>MONOPOLY</small> over their innovation. Economists disagree on how long that protection should last, given the inefficiencies that result from any monopoly.</p><p>For most of the second half of the 20th century, governments played a crucial role in funding and directing pure research and early-stage development. In the 1980s, however, legal changes in the US started to reduce this role. One change aimed to move technological development out of the country’s state-financed national laboratories. Another allowed universities, not-for-profit research institutes and small businesses doing research under government contract to keep the technologies they had developed and to apply for patents in their own names. This appears to have contributed to a surge in innovation in the US, as government researchers and university professors teamed up with outside firms, or started their own. <small>CLUSTERS</small> of innovative firms have sprung up, chief among them Silicon Valley in California, which has become a magnet for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and the intermediaries, from lawyers to bankers to mentors, who help them succeed. Silicon Valley has produced several generations of world-changing firms, from Hewlett-Packard and Intel to Google, Facebook and Uber. Hoping for similar results, many other countries have tried to create “Silicon” clusters of their own, typically with no more than modest success.</p><p>Is innovation all it is cracked up to be, or is it just change for change’s sake? A few years ago, Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, observed that “you can see the computer age everywhere these days except in the <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> statistics”. Although new computer technology clearly had affected people and firms in visible and obvious ways, the slowdown in productivity growth that had afflicted the US economy since the 1970s did not appear to have been reversed. Believers in the <small>NEW ECONOMY</small> argued that the “Solow Paradox” no longer held true; in the late 1990s and even more so after 2000, the computer revolution started to generate the productivity growth long promised. Even so, this shows that innovation can take a long time to deliver the goods.</p>

<h2>insider trading</h2>
<p>A practice that was made illegal in the US in 1934 and in the UK in 1980, and is now banned (for shares, at least) in most countries. Insider trading involves using <small>INFORMATION</small> that is not in the public domain but that will move the price of a <small>SHARE, BOND</small> or currency when it is made public. An insider trade takes place when someone with privileged, confidential access to that information trades to take advantage of the fact that <small>PRICES</small> will move when the news gets out. This is frowned on because investors may lose confidence in <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> if they see insiders taking advantage of valuable <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small> to enrich themselves at the expense of outsiders. But some economists reckon that insider trading leads to more efficient markets: by transmitting the inside information to the market, it makes the price of, say, a company’s shares more accurate. This may be true, but most financial regulators are willing to sacrifice a degree of accuracy in pricing to ensure that outsiders (the great majority of investors) feel they are being treated fairly.</p>

<h2>institutional economics</h2>
<p>A Darwinian version of the dismal science, also known as evolutionary economics. At one time the dominant school of economics in the US, it views the economy as an evolving system and places a strong emphasis on dynamics, changing structures (including technologies, institutions, beliefs and behaviour) and <small>DISEQUILIBRIUM</small> processes (such as <small>INNOVATION</small>, selection and imitation). Early advocates of institutional economics include Thorstein Veblen, author of <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class,</i> and Adolphe Berle, co-author with Gardiner Means of <i>The Modern Corporation and Private Property,</i> an influential early theory of the modern firm which highlighted the <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> arising from the separation of ownership and management.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in the role that institutions play in the economy. This “new institutional economics” argued that institutions should be integrated into <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> as a solution to some of the problems caused by dispersed and <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small>. This approach initially argued that institutions were rational solutions to these problems, but increasingly insights into the irrationality of some institutions have been added from <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small>. In 1993, the leading practitioner of new institutional economics, Douglass North, was awarded a Nobel Prize.</p>

<h2>insurance</h2>
<p>In economic terms, anything used to reduce the downside of <small>RISK</small>. In its most familiar form, insurance is provided through a policy purchased from an insurance company. But a fuller definition would also include, say, a financial security (or anything else) used to <small>HEDGE</small>, as well as assistance available in the event of disaster. It could even be provided by the <small>GOVERNMENT</small>, in various ways, including <small>WELFARE</small> payments to sick or poor people and legal protection from <small>CREDITORS</small> in the event of <small>BANKRUPTCY</small>.</p><p>Conventional insurance works by pooling the risks of many people (or <small>FIRMS</small>, and so on), all of whom might claim, but in practice only a few actually do. The cost of providing assistance to those that claim is spread over all the potential claimants, thus making the insurance affordable to all.</p><p>Despite the enormous attraction of insurance, private markets in insurance often work badly, or not at all. Economists have identified three main reasons for this:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">Private firms are unwilling to provide insurance if they are uncertain about the likely cost of providing sufficient cover, especially if it is potentially unlimited.</span></li><li><span class="black1"><small>MORAL HAZARD</small> means that people with insurance may take greater risks because they know they are protected, so the insurer may get a bigger bill than it bargained for.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Insurers are at risk of <small>ADVERSE SELECTION</small>. The people who are most likely to claim buy insurance, and those who are least likely to claim do not buy it. In this situation, setting a price for insurance that will generate enough premiums to cover all claims is tricky, if not impossible.</span></li></ul><p>Insurers have found ways of reducing the impact of these problems. For example, to counter adverse selection, they set higher health-insurance rates for people who smoke. To limit moral hazard, they offer reduced premiums to people who agree to pay the first so many dollars or pounds of any claim.</p><p>An efficient system of insurance, in its broadest sense, can contribute to economic <small>GROWTH</small> by encouraging entrepreneurial risk-taking and by enabling people to choose which risks they take and which they protect themselves against.</p>

<h2>interest</h2>
<p>The cost of borrowing, which compensates lenders for the <small>RISK</small> they take in making their <small>MONEY</small> available to borrowers. Without interest there would be little lending and thus a lot less economic activity. The charging of interest is contrary to Sharia (Islamic) law, being considered <small>USURY</small>. Some US states also have usury laws, imposing tough conditions on the terms set by lenders, although not actually prohibiting interest. Yet as the rise of a substantial banking industry in Islamic Middle Eastern countries shows, when economic <small>GROWTH</small> is a priority, ways can usually be found to pay lenders to lend.</p>

<h2>interest rate</h2>
<p><small>INTEREST</small> is usually expressed at an annual rate: the amount of interest that would be paid during a year divided by the amount of <small>MONEY</small> loaned. Developed economies offer many different interest rates, reflecting the length of the loan and the riskiness and wealth of the borrower. People often use the term “interest rate” when they mean the short-term interest rate charged to <small>BANKS</small>. For instance, when a <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> raises or cuts interest rates, it changes only the <small>PRICE</small> it charges to banks borrowing money overnight, expressed as an annual rate. <small>BOND YIELDS</small> are a better measure of the interest rate on loans that do not have to be repaid for many years. Unlike short-term interest rates, bond yields are determined not by central bankers but by the <small>SUPPLY</small> of and <small>DEMAND</small> for money, which is heavily influenced by the expected rate of <small>INFLATION</small>.

<h2>international aid</h2>
<p>A helping hand for poor countries from rich countries. This, at least, is the intention. In practice, in many cases aid has done little good for its intended recipients (improved health care is a notable exception) and has sometimes made matters worse. Poor countries that receive lots of aid grow no faster, on average, than those that receive very little. By contrast, perhaps the most successful aid programme ever – the <small>MARSHALL PLAN</small> for rebuilding Europe after the second world war – involved rich countries giving to other hitherto rich countries.</p><p>During the second half of the 20th century rich countries gave over $1 trillion in aid to poor ones. During the 1990s, however, flows of official aid stagnated. In 2001, official aid was a little over $50 billion, roughly one-quarter of the <small>GDP</small> of donor countries. On top of this were private-sector donations from <small>NGOS</small> worth an estimated $6 billion. Increasingly, such sums were exceeded by private <small>FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT</small> and <small>REMITTANCES</small>. In an attempt to reinvigorate international aid, in 2000 the <small>UN</small> committed itself to eight ambitious Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for reducing global <small>POVERTY</small> by 2015. At the G8 summit in 2005, the world’s richest countries committed themselves to a sharp increase in aid to the poorest ones, along with <small>DEBT</small> forgiveness and further trade <small>LIBERALISATION</small>. This more recent aid, according to some economists, was better managed and played a part in making greater progress on the MDGs than had been generally expected. In 2015, a new set of <small>GLOBAL GOALS</small> was adopted.</p><p>Why has aid achieved so little, at least until recently? Donations have often ended up in the offshore bank accounts of corrupt politicians and officials in poor countries. <small>MONEY</small> has often been given with strings attached, so that much of this “tied” aid is spent on companies and corrupt politicians and officials in the donor country. War has ravaged many potentially beneficial aid projects. Moreover, much aid has been motivated by political goals – for example, shoring up anti-communist governments – rather than economic ones.</p><p>The lesson of history is that aid will often be wasted, or cause harm, unless it is carefully aimed at countries with a genuine commitment to sound economic management. Analysis by the <small>WORLD BANK</small> sorted 56 aid-receiving countries by the quality of their economic management. Those with good policies (low <small>INFLATION</small>, a <small>BUDGET</small> surplus and openness to trade) and good institutions (little <small>CORRUPTION</small>, strong rule of law, effective bureaucracy) benefited from the aid they received. Those with poor policies and institutions did not. This accounts for the growing popularity of <small>CONDITIONALITY</small> in aid.</p><p>There has also been a growing focus on using aid to support the development of local economies in countries receiving the money. Instead of fostering a dependency culture, as aid has often done in the past, supporting so-called “market-based solutions” is intended to help build in aid recipients the <small>CAPACITY</small>, hopefully sooner rather than later, to provide for themselves.</p>

But this has never been true in the short run and, as a result of <small>GLOBALISATION</small>, may never be even in the <small>LONG RUN</small>, as countries with low savings can attract investment from overseas and foreign savers lacking opportunities at home can invest abroad (see <small><a href="#name.231">FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT</a></small>).</p><p>The more of its <small>GDP</small> a country invests, the faster its economy should grow. This is why <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> try so hard to increase total investment through, for instance, tax breaks and <small>SUBSIDY</small>, or direct <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> on <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>. However, evidence suggests that the best way to encourage private-sector investment is to pursue a stable <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small>, with low <small>INFLATION</small>, low <small>INTEREST RATES</small> and low rates of <small>TAXATION</small>. Curiously, economic studies have not found evidence that higher investment leads to higher rates of GDP <small>GROWTH</small>. One explanation for this is that the circumstances and manner in which money is invested count at least as much as the total sums invested. It ain’t how much you do, it’s the way that you do it.</p>

If everybody acts from self-interest, spurred on by the <small>PROFIT</small> motive, the economy will work more efficiently, and more productively, than it would do were economic activity directed instead by some sort of central planner. It is, wrote Smith, as if an “invisible hand” guides the actions of individuals to combine for the common good.

<h2>Keynes, John Maynard</h2>
<p>A great and much-quoted British economist, not famous for holding the same opinion for long. Born in 1883, he studied at Cambridge but came to reject much of the <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> and <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> associated with that university. Keynes helped set up the <small>BRETTON WOODS</small> framework, but he is best known for his <i>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,</i> published in 1936 in the depths of the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small>. This invented modern <small>MACROECONOMICS</small>. It argued that economies could sometimes be stable (in <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>) even when they did not have <small>FULL EMPLOYMENT</small>, but that a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> could remedy this under-employment problem by increasing <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and/or reducing <small>TAXATION</small>, thereby increasing aggregate <small>DEMAND</small> in the economy. Many politicians picked up on these ideas. As President Richard Nixon allegedly observed in 1971, “We are all Keynesians now.” However, it is much debated whether Keynes would have supported the way many of them put his thoughts into practice.</p><p>Keynes identified the economic importance of <small>ANIMAL SPIRITS</small>. Making and losing fortunes in the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> led him to refer to the “casino <small>CAPITALISM</small>” of the stockmarket. He also noted that “there is nothing so dangerous as the pursuit of a rational <small>INVESTMENT</small> policy in an irrational world”. He had an amusingly accurate view of the impact and transmission of economic ideas: “Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” As for the frequency with which his opinions would evolve: “When the facts change, I change my mind – what do you do, sir?” “In the <small>LONG RUN</small> we are all dead,” he said. For him, the long run arrived in 1946.</p>

<h2>Keynesian</h2>
<p>A branch of <small>ECONOMICS</small>, based, often loosely, on the ideas of <small>KEYNES</small>, characterised by a belief in active <small>GOVERNMENT</small> and suspicion of market outcomes. It was dominant in the 30 years following the second world war, and especially during the 1960s, when <small>FISCAL POLICY</small> became bigger-spending and looser in most developed countries as policymakers tried to kill off the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small>. During the 1970s, widely blamed for the rise in inflation, Keynesian policies gradually gave way to <small>MONETARISM</small> and microeconomic policies that owed much to the <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> that Keynes had at times opposed. Even so, the idea that <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and <small>TAXATION</small> have a crucial role to play in managing <small>DEMAND</small>, in order to move towards <small>FULL EMPLOYMENT</small>, remained at the heart of <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> in most countries, even after the monetarist and supply-side revolution of the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>Recently, a school of new, more pro-market Keynesian economists has emerged, believing that most markets work, but sometimes only slowly. Following the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the start of the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small>, there was a revival of enthusiasm for Keynesian ideas, as many governments sharply increased public spending in an effort to prevent economic disaster. In his home country, however, the coalition government elected in 2010 publicly espoused a decidedly non-Keynesian policy of <small>AUSTERITY</small>.</p>

<h2>labour</h2>
<p>One of the factors of production, with <small>LAND, CAPITAL</small> and <small>ENTERPRISE</small>. Among the things that determine the <small>SUPPLY</small> of labour are the number of able people in the population, their willingness to work, labour laws and regulations, and the health of the economy and <small>FIRMS.

<h2>labour-market flexibility</h2>
<p>A flexible <small>LABOUR</small> market is one in which it is easy and inexpensive for firms to vary the amount of labour they use, including by changing the hours worked by each employee and the number of employees. This often means minimal <small>REGULATION</small> of the terms of employment (no <small>MINIMUM WAGE</small>, say) and weak (or no) trade <small>UNIONS</small>. Such flexibility is characterised by its opponents as giving <small>FIRMS</small> all the power, allowing them to fire employees at a moment’s notice and leaving workers feeling insecure.</p><p>Opponents of labour-market flexibility claim that labour laws that make workers feel more secure encourage employees to invest in acquiring skills that enable them to do their current job better but that could not be taken with them to another firm if they were let go. Supporters claim that it improves economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small> by leaving it to <small>MARKET FORCES</small> to decide the terms of employment. Broadly, the evidence is that greater flexibility is associated with lower rates of <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> and higher <small>GDP</small> per head.</p>

<h2>Laffer curve</h2>
<p>Legend has it that in November 1974 Arthur Laffer, a young economist, drew a curve on a napkin in a Washington bar, linking <small>AVERAGE</small> tax rates to total tax revenue. Initially, higher tax rates would increase revenue, but at some point further increases in tax rates would cause revenue to fall, for instance by discouraging people from working. The curve became an icon of supply-side <small>ECONOMICS</small>. Some economists said that it proved that most <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> could raise more revenue by cutting tax rates, an argument that was often cited in the 1980s by the tax-cutting governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Other economists reckoned that most countries were still at a point on the curve at which raising tax rates would increase revenue. The lack of empirical evidence meant that nobody could really be sure where the US and other countries were on the Laffer curve. However, after the Reagan administration cut tax rates revenue fell at first. US tax rates were already low compared with some countries, especially in continental Europe, and it remains possible that these countries are at a point on the Laffer curve where cutting tax rates would pay.</p>

<h2>laissez-faire</h2>
<p>Let-it-be <small>ECONOMICS</small>: the belief that an economy functions best when there is no interference by <small>GOVERNMENT</small>. It can be traced to the 18th-century French physiocrats, who believed in government according to the natural order and opposed <small>MERCANTILISM</small>. Adam <small>SMITH</small> and others turned it into a central tenet of <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, as it allowed the <small>INVISIBLE HAND</small> to operate efficiently. (But even they saw a need for some limited government role in the economy.) In the 19th century, it inspired the British political movement that secured the repeal of the Corn Laws and promoted <small>FREE TRADE</small>, and gave birth to <i>The Economist</i> in 1843. In the 20th century, laissez-faire was often seen as synonymous with supporting <small>MONOPOLY</small> and allowing the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small> to boom and bust, and it came off second-best against <small>KEYNESIAN</small> policies of interventionist government. However, mounting evidence of the inefficiency of state intervention inspired the free-market policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, both of whom stressed the importance of laissez-faire.</p><p>After nearly three decades of intellectual ascendancy, the validity of this approach to economics was called into question by the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> after it. This led to far greater government involvement in the economy, including through heavier regulation of the financial industry. The (right-wing) French president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared: “Laissez-faire, c’est fini.” Whether or not he was right remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>land tax</h2>
<p>Henry George, a 19th-century American economist, believed that taxes should be levied only on the value of <small>LAND</small>, not on <small>LABOUR</small> or <small>CAPITAL</small>. This “single tax”, he asserted in his book, <i>Progress and Poverty,</i> would end <small>UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, INFLATION</small> and <small>INEQUALITY</small>. Many countries levy some tax on land or property values, although George’s single tax has never been fully implemented. This is mainly because of fears that it would drive down land prices too much or discourage efforts to improve the quality (that is, the economic value) of land. George addressed this concern by arguing that the tax should be levied only against the value of “unimproved” land. Certainly, a land tax has obvious advantages: it is simple and cheap to levy; evasion is all but impossible; and it penalises owners who do not put their land to work.</p>

<h2>law and economics</h2>
<p>Laws can be an important source of economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small> – or inefficiency. Early economists such as Adam <small>SMITH</small> often wrote about the economic impact of legal matters. But <small>ECONOMICS</small> subsequently focused more narrowly on things monetary and commercial. It was only in the 1940s and 1950s, at the University of Chicago Law School, that the discipline of law and economics was born. It is now a substantial branch of economics and has had an impact beyond the ivory towers.</p><p>Until recently, the “economics” of law and economics was firmly in the liberal economics camp, favouring free markets and arguing that <small>REGULATION</small> often does more harm than good. Its growth went hand-in-hand with the revival of the <small>LAISSEZ-FAIRE</small> thinking that was championed by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It stressed the economic value of having clear, enforceable <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small>, and of ensuring that these can be bought and sold. It encouraged many <small>ANTITRUST</small> policymakers to focus on maximising consumer <small>WELFARE</small>, rather than, say, protecting small <small>FIRMS</small> or opposing big ones just because they are big. It also ventured into broader sociological issues, such as analysing the economic causes of criminality and how to structure legal incentives to reduce crime. (See also <small><a href="#name.314">INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS</a></small>.)</p><p>These days, academic practitioners of law and economics approach the subject more broadly, not always staying true to the liberal economics of the pioneers of the subject.</p>

<h2>lender of last resort</h2>
<p>One of the main functions of a <small>CENTRAL BANK</small>.

This role of the central bank makes <small>CREDIT CREATION</small> easier by increasing confidence in the banking system and minimising the <small>RISK</small> of a bank run by reassuring depositors that their <small>MONEY</small> is safe. However, it also creates a potential <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>: that banks will lend more recklessly because they know they will be bailed out if things go wrong.</p><p>The <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 occurred when Lehman Brothers was denied lender-of-last-resort support because it was merely an investment bank. After its collapse other investment banks were allowed to reclassify themselves as the sort of bank that could and did get such support. This led to a fierce debate about when such support should be extended and to which sort of institution – the broad conclusion being any whose collapse could pose a <small>SYSTEMIC RISK</small> to the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> – and how to regulate financial firms deemed <small>TOO BIG TO FAIL</small>, so that they do not take the sort of excessive risks that could bring the system down.</p>

They were popular again during the easy-credit years in the mid-2000s, by then rebranded as <small>PRIVATE EQUITY</small>. Although some LBOs end up with the borrower going bust, in most cases the need to meet demanding interest bills drives the new managers to run the firm more efficiently than their predecessors did.

<h2>life</h2>
<p>Human life is priceless. But this has not stopped economists trying to put a financial value on it. One reason is to help <small>FIRMS</small> and policymakers to make better decisions on how much to spend on costly safety measures designed to reduce the loss of life. Another is to help insurers and courts judge how much compensation to pay in the event of, say, a fatal accident.</p><p>One way to value a life is to calculate a person’s <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small> by working out how much they would earn were they to survive to a ripe old age. This could result in different sums being paid to victims of the same accident. After an air crash, probably more <small>MONEY</small> would go to the family of a first-class passenger than to that of someone flying economy. This may not seem fair. Nor would using this method to decide what to spend on safety measures, as it would mean much higher expenditure on avoiding the death of, say, an investment banker than on saving the life of a teacher or coal miner. It would also imply spending more on safety measures for young people and being positively reckless with the lives of retired people.</p><p>Another approach is to analyse the <small>RISKS</small> that people are voluntarily willing to take, and how much they require to be paid for taking them. Taking into account differences in <small>WAGES</small> for high death-risk and low death-risk jobs, and allowing for differences in education, experience, and so on, it is possible to calculate roughly what value people put on their own lives. In industrialised countries, most studies using this method come up with a value of $5 million–10 million.</p>

<h2>life-cycle hypothesis</h2>
<p>An attempt to explain the way that people split their <small>INCOME</small> between spending and saving, and the way that they borrow. Over their lifetime, a typical person’s spending varies by far less than their income because of “<small>CONSUMPTION</small> smoothing”. On average, young people have low incomes but big spending commitments, such as investing in their <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small> through education and training, building a family, buying a home, and so on. So they do not save much and often borrow heavily. As they get older their income generally rises, they pay off their mortgage, the children leave home and they prepare for retirement, so they sharply increase their saving and investment. In retirement, their income is largely or entirely from state benefits and the <small>SAVINGS</small> and investments they made when working; they spend most or all of their income, and, by selling off <small>ASSETS</small>, often spend more than their income.</p><p>Broadly, this theory is supported by the data, though some economists argue that young people do not spend as much as they should on, say, being educated, because lenders are reluctant to extend <small>CREDIT</small> to them. One puzzle is that people often have substantial assets left when they die. Some economists say this is because they want to leave a generous inheritance for their relatives; others say that people are simply far too optimistic about how long they will live.

Financial marketmakers (middlemen such as investment <small>BANKS</small>) can also increase liquidity by using some of their <small>CAPITAL</small> to buy <small>SECURITIES</small> from those who want to sell, when there is no other buyer offering a decent price. They do this in the expectation that if they hold the asset for a while they will be able to find somebody to buy it. Typically, the higher the volume of trades taking place in a marketplace, the greater is its liquidity. Moreover, highly liquid markets attract more liquidity-seeking traders, further increasing liquidity.</p><p>In a similar way, there can be vicious cycles in which liquidity dries up. The amount of liquidity in financial markets can vary enormously from one moment to the next, and can sometimes evaporate entirely, especially if marketmakers become too <small>RISK-AVERSE</small> to put their capital at risk in this way. This was the case in the <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> starting in 2007 that led up to the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, plunging the global economy into crisis. As a result, regulators now pay more heed to liquidity risk when evaluating the strength of a financial institution.</p>

<h2>liquidity trap</h2>
<p>When <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> becomes impotent. Cutting the rate of <small>INTEREST</small> is supposed to be the escape route from economic <small>RECESSION</small>, boosting the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>, increasing <small>DEMAND</small> and thus reducing <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. But <small>KEYNES</small> argued that sometimes cutting the rate of interest, even to zero, would not help. People, <small>BANKS</small> and <small>FIRMS</small> could become so <small>RISK-AVERSE</small> that they preferred the liquidity of cash to offering <small>CREDIT</small> or using the credit that is on offer. In such circumstances, the economy would be trapped in recession, despite the best efforts of monetary policymakers.</p><p><small>KEYNESIANS</small> reckon that in the 1930s the economies of both the US and the UK were caught in a liquidity trap. In the late 1990s, the Japanese economy suffered a similar fate. Arguably, the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> and the sluggish recovery that followed it also stemmed from liquidity-trap problems, and some <small>CENTRAL BANKS</small>, including the <small>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</small>, even set negative <small>INTEREST RATES</small> in an effort to encourage people to spend rather than pay their banks to store their <small>MONEY</small>. But <small>MONETARISM</small> has no place for liquidity traps. Monetarists pin the blame for the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small> and the more recent examples on other factors and reckon that ways could have been found to make monetary policy work.</p>

<h2>lump of labour fallacy</h2>
<p>One of the best-known fallacies in <small>ECONOMICS</small> is the notion that there is a fixed amount of work to be done – a lump of <small>LABOUR</small> – which can be shared out in different ways to create fewer or more jobs. For instance, suppose that everybody worked 10% fewer hours. <small>FIRMS</small> would need to hire more workers. Hey presto, <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> would shrink.</p><p>In 1891 D.F. Schloss, an economist, described such thinking as the lump of labour fallacy because, in reality, the amount of work to be done is not fixed. <small>GOVERNMENT</small>-imposed restrictions on the amount of work people may do can reduce the <small>EFFICIENCY</small> of the labour market, thereby increasing unemployment. Shorter hours will create more jobs only if weekly pay is also cut (which workers are likely to resist), otherwise costs per unit of <small>OUTPUT</small> will rise. Not all labour costs vary with the number of hours worked. <small>FIXED COSTS</small>, such as recruitment and training, can be substantial, so it will cost a firm more to hire two part-time workers than one full-timer. Thus a cut in the working week may raise <small>AVERAGE</small> costs per unit of output and cause firms to buy fewer total hours of labour. A better way to reduce unemployment may be to stimulate <small>DEMAND</small> and so increase output; another is to make the labour market more flexible, not less.</p>

<h2>lump-sum tax</h2>
<p>A tax that is the same amount for everybody, regardless of differences in <small>INCOME</small> or wealth. Some economists argue that this is the most efficient form of <small>TAXATION</small>, as it does not distort incentives and thus has no <small>DEADWEIGHT COST</small>. This is because each person knows that whatever they do they will have to pay the same amount. It is also cheap to administer, as there is no complex process of measuring each person’s income and <small>ASSETS</small> in order to calculate their tax bill. However, because rich and poor people pay the same, the tax may be perceived as unfair – as Margaret Thatcher found out when she introduced a lump-sum “poll tax”, a decision that was later to play a large part in her ousting as UK prime minister.</p>

<h2>macroeconomic policy</h2>
<p>Top-down policy by <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> and <small>CENTRAL BANKS</small>, usually intended to maximise <small>GROWTH</small> while keeping down <small>INFLATION</small> and <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. The main instruments of macroeconomic policy are changes in the rate of <small>INTEREST</small> and <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>, known as <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>, and changes in <small>TAXATION</small> and <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small>, known as <small>FISCAL POLICY</small>. The fact that unemployment and inflation often rise sharply, and that growth often slows or <small>GDP</small> falls, may be evidence of poorly executed macroeconomic policy.

<h2>manufacturing</h2>
<p>Making things like cars or frozen food has shrunk in importance in most developed countries during the past half-century as <small>SERVICES</small> have grown. In the US and the UK, the proportion of workers in manufacturing has shrunk since 1900 from around 40% to barely 20%. More than two-thirds of <small>OUTPUT</small> in <small>OECD</small> countries, and up to four-fifths of employment, is now in the services sector. At the same time, manufacturing has grown in importance in <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>.</p><p>Many people think that manufacturing somehow matters more than any other economic activity and is in some way superior to surfing the internet or cutting somebody’s hair. This is probably nothing more than nostalgia for times past when making things in factories was what real men did, just as 150 years ago growing things in fields was what real men did. Mostly, the shift from manufacturing to services (as with the earlier shift from <small>AGRICULTURE</small> to manufacturing) reflects progress into jobs that create more <small>UTILITY</small>, this time for real women as well as real men, which may explain why it is happening first in richer countries.</p><p>In recent years, technological shifts that have been described as a new industrial revolution are transforming manufacturing. These include the development of new materials that make possible innovative production processes, and advances in 3D printing and digital design. Consequently, manufacturing in small, customised batches may become easier, reducing the need for homogeneous mass production, and may more easily be done close to the customer, reducing the economic case for using factories in far-off places. This has potentially huge implications for how companies design their <small>SUPPLY</small> chains and how products are sold and delivered to consumers.</p>

<h2>marginal</h2>
<p>The difference made by one extra unit of something. Marginal revenue is the extra revenue earned by selling one more unit of something. The marginal <small>PRICE</small> is how much extra a consumer must pay to buy one extra unit. Marginal <small>UTILITY</small> is how much extra utility a person gets from consuming (or doing) an extra unit of something. The marginal product of labour is how much extra <small>OUTPUT</small> a firm would get by employing an extra worker, or by getting an existing worker to put in an extra hour on the job. The marginal <small>PROPENSITY</small> to consume (or to save) measures by how much a household’s <small>CONSUMPTION</small> (<small>SAVINGS</small>) would increase if its <small>INCOME</small> rose by, say, $1. The marginal tax rate measures how much extra tax you would have to pay if you earned an extra dollar.</p><p>The marginal cost (or whatever) can be very different from the <small>AVERAGE</small> cost (or whatever), which simply divides total costs (or whatever) by the total number of units produced (or whatever). A common finding in <small>MICROECONOMICS</small> is that small incremental changes can matter enormously. In general, thinking “at the margin” often leads to better economic decision-making than thinking about the averages.</p><p>Alfred <small>MARSHALL</small>, the father of <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, based many of his theories of economic behaviour on marginal rather than average behaviour. For instance, given certain plausible assumptions, a <small>PROFIT</small>-maximising firm will increase production up to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This is because if marginal revenue exceeded marginal cost, the firm could increase its profit by producing an extra unit of output. Alternatively, if marginal cost exceeded marginal revenue, the firm could increase its profit by producing fewer units of output.</p><p>In all walks of life, a basic rule of rational economic decision-making is this: do something only if the marginal utility you get from it exceeds the marginal cost of doing it.</p>

<h2>Marshall, Alfred</h2>
<p>A British economist (1842–1924) who developed some of the most important concepts in <small>MICROECONOMICS</small>. In his best-known work, <i>Principles of Economics,</i> he retained an emphasis on the importance of costs, which was standard in <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>. But he added to it, helping to create <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, by explaining that the <small>OUTPUT</small> and <small>PRICE</small> of a product are determined by both <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small>, and that <small>MARGINAL</small> costs and benefits are crucial. He was the first economist to explain that demand falls as price increases, and that therefore the <small>DEMAND CURVE</small> slopes downwards from left to right. He was also first with the concept of <small>PRICE ELASTICITY</small> of demand and <small>CONSUMER SURPLUS</small>.</p>

<h2>Marshall Plan</h2>
<p>Probably the most successful programme of <small>INTERNATIONAL AID</small> and nation building in history. It was named after General George Marshall, an American secretary of state, who at the end of the second world war proposed giving aid to western Europe to rebuild its war-torn economies. North America gave around 1% of its <small>GDP</small> in total between 1948 and 1952; most of it came from the US and the rest from Canada. The Americans left it to the Europeans to work out the details on allocating aid, which may be why, according to most economic analyses, it achieved more success than latter-day aid programmes in which most of the decisions on how the <small>MONEY</small> is spent are made by the donors. The main institution through which aid was administered was the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, which in 1961 became the <small>OECD</small>. Nowadays, whenever there is a proposal for the international community to rebuild an economy damaged by war, such as Iraq’s in 2003 or Ukraine’s in 2014, you are sure to hear the phrase “new Marshall Plan”.</p>

<h2>Marx, Karl</h2>
<p>Much followed, and much misunderstood, German economist (1818–83). His two best-known works were the <i>Communist Manifesto,</i> written in 1848 with Friedrich Engels, and <i>Das Kapital,</i> in four volumes published between 1867 and 1910. Most of his economic assumptions were drawn from orthodox <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, but he used them to reach highly unorthodox conclusions. Although claimed and blamed as the inspiration of some of the most virulently anti-market <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> the world has ever seen, he was not wholly against <small>CAPITALISM</small>. Indeed, he praised it for rescuing millions of people from “the idiocy of rural life”. Even so, he thought it was doomed. A shortage of <small>DEMAND</small> would concentrate economic power and wealth in ever fewer hands, producing an ever-larger and more miserable proletariat. This would eventually rise up, creating a “dictatorship of the proletariat” and leading in time to a “withering away” of the state. Marx thought that this version of history was inevitable. So far, history has proved him wrong, largely because capitalism has delivered a much better deal to the masses than he believed it would, mainly by achieving ever higher levels of <small>GROWTH</small>.</p>

<h2>mercantilism</h2>
<p>The conventional economic wisdom of the 17th century that has made a partial comeback in recent years (not least within the <small>GOVERNMENT</small> of China). Mercantilists feared that <small>MONEY</small> would become too scarce to sustain high <small>OUTPUT</small> and employment; their favoured solution was cheap money (low <small>INTEREST RATES</small>). In a forerunner to the 20th-century debate between <small>KEYNESIANS</small> and monetarists, they were opposed by advocates of <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, who argued that cheap and plentiful money could result in <small>INFLATION</small>. The original mercantilists, such as John Law, a Scottish financier (and convicted murderer), believed that a country’s economic prosperity and political power came from its stocks of precious metals. To maximise these stocks they argued against <small>FREE TRADE</small>, favouring protectionist policies designed to minimise <small>IMPORTS</small> and maximise <small>EXPORTS</small>, creating a <small>TRADE SURPLUS</small> that could be used to acquire more precious metal. This was contested for the classicists by Adam <small>SMITH</small> and David Hume, who argued that a country’s wealth came not from its stock of precious metals but rather from its stocks of productive resources (<small>LAND, LABOUR, CAPITAL</small>, and so on) and how efficiently they are used. Free trade increased <small>EFFICIENCY</small> by allowing countries to specialise in things in which they have a <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small>.</p>

<h2>mergers and acquisitions</h2>
<p>When two businesses join together, either by merging or by one company taking over the other.

These can be a voluntary marriage of equals; a voluntary takeover of one firm by another; or a hostile takeover, in which the management of the target firm resists the advances of the buyer but is eventually forced to accept a deal by its current owners. For reasons that are not at all clear, merger activity generally happens in waves. One possible explanation is that when <small>SHARE PRICES</small> are low, many firms have a <small>MARKET CAPITALISATION</small> that is low relative to the value of their <small>ASSETS</small>. This makes them attractive to buyers (see <small><a href="#name.676">TOBIN</a></small>).</p><p>In theory, the different sorts of mergers have different sorts of potential benefits. However, the damning lesson of merger waves stretching back over the past 50 years is that, with one big exception – the spate of <small>LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS</small> in the US during the 1980s – they have often failed to deliver benefits that justify the costs. Whether the merger wave that began to build in 2013, driven in part by global consolidation, will prove to have been more successful remains to be seen.</p>

Increasingly, other financial services, from <small>SAVINGS</small> accounts to <small>INSURANCE</small>, are being offered as well as microcredit. Initially, microfinance relied heavily on charitable donations to provide the initial <small>CAPITAL</small> to lend, though repayment rates have generally been high, demonstrating that being poor does not necessarily make someone a high-risk <small>CREDITOR</small>. More recently, there has been a rapid growth in for-<small>PROFIT</small> microfinance. Its critics say that it is wrong to make a profit from the very poor.

<h2>minimum wage</h2>
<p>A minimum rate that <small>FIRMS</small> are legally obliged to pay to their workers. Most industrial countries have a minimum wage, although certain sorts of workers are often exempted, such as young people or part-timers. Most economists reckon that a minimum wage, if it is doing what it is meant to do, will lead to higher <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> than there would be without it. The main justification offered by politicians for having a minimum wage is that the wage that would be decided by buyers and sellers in a free market would be so low that it would be immoral for people to work for it. So the minimum wage should be above the market-clearing wage, in which case fewer workers would be demanded at that wage than would be hired at the market wage. How many fewer will depend on how far the minimum wage is above the market wage.</p><p>Some economists have challenged this simple <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small> model. Several empirical studies have suggested that a minimum wage moderately above the free-market wage would not harm employment much and could (in rare circumstances) potentially raise it, say by reducing high workforce turnover rates that can be a disincentive to hire. These studies are gaining acceptance among economists and policymakers. Whatever it does for those in work, a minimum wage cannot help the majority of the very poorest people in most countries who typically have no job in which to earn a minimum wage.</p>

However, this trend was reversed, temporarily, in the aftermath of the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, as many governments took ownership stakes in leading <small>BANKS</small> and some other firms.</p>

<h2>mobility</h2>
<p>The easier it is for the <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small> to move to where they are most valuable, the more efficient the allocation of the world’s scarce resources is likely to be and the faster <small>GDP</small> will grow. Apart from continental drift, land is immobile. <small>CAPITAL</small> has long been extremely mobile within countries, and, with the rise of <small>GLOBALISATION</small>, it is now able to move easily around the world. <small>ENTERPRISE</small> is mobile, although to what extent depends on the particular <small>ENTREPRENEUR</small>. Some members of the <small>LABOUR</small> market zoom around the world to work; others will not move to the next town.</p><p><small>CAPITAL CONTROLS</small> are the main obstacle to capital mobility, and these have been mostly removed or reduced since 1980. The sources of labour immobility are more numerous and complex, including immigration controls, transport costs, language barriers and a reluctance to move away from family or friends. Workers are far more mobile within the US than they are within the <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> or within individual EU countries. Some economists reckon that the willingness of workers to move to where the work is helps to explain the stronger economic performance and lower <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> of the US. The higher <small>INCOMES</small> available in rich countries have also led poorer countries to complain of a “brain drain” as their most talented workers move abroad. However, their absence is often eased by substantial sums of money sent home as <small>REMITTANCES</small> to family members.</p><p>Can you sometimes have too much mobility? Certainly, some <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small> have suffered from <small>HOT MONEY</small> rushing into and then out of their markets. The recent increase in the number of refugees to record levels has caused hostility among the inhabitants of countries where they are seeking to be relocated and even prompted the EU to consider restoring border controls that had been lifted to encourage the free movement of labour.</p><p>In general, the possibility that a factor of production may suddenly move elsewhere can create serious economic problems. For instance, an employer may think twice about investing in training an employee if it fears that the employee may suddenly take a job with another firm. Similarly, entrepreneurs are unlikely to take the <small>RISK</small> of pursuing a new idea if they fear that their capital may disappear at any moment, hence the importance of having access to long-term capital, such as by issuing <small>BONDS</small> and equities.</p>

<h2>modelling</h2>
<p>When economists make a number of simplified assumptions about how the economy, or some part of it, behaves, and then see what this implies in various different scenarios. Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small> argued that economic models should not be judged on the basis of the validity of their assumptions, but on the accuracy of their predictions. An expert billiards player, he said, may not know the laws of physics, but acts as if he knows such laws. So his behaviour could be predicted accurately with a model that assumes he knows the laws of physics. Likewise, the behaviour of people making economic decisions may be accurately predicted by a model that assumes their goal is, say, <small>PROFIT MAXIMISATION</small>, even if they are not actually conscious of this being their goal.</p><p>The more complex the thing being modelled, the harder it is to get right. Economic <small>FORECASTING</small> has a poor overall track record. The more microeconomic the thing being modelled, the more likely it is that a model can be designed that will deliver accurate predictions.</p>

<h2>modern portfolio theory</h2>
<p>One of the most important and influential economic theories about finance and <small>INVESTMENT</small>. Modern portfolio theory is based upon the simple idea that <small>DIVERSIFICATION</small> can produce the same total <small>RETURNS</small> for less <small>RISK</small>. Combining many financial <small>ASSETS</small> in a portfolio is less risky than putting all your investment eggs in one basket.</p><p>The theory has four basic premises:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">Investors are <small>RISK-AVERSE</small>.</span></li><li><span class="black1"><small>SECURITIES</small> are traded in efficient markets.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Risk should be analysed in terms of an investor’s overall portfolio, rather than by looking at individual assets.</span></li><li><span class="black1">For every level of risk, there is an optimal portfolio of assets that will have the highest <small>EXPECTED RETURNS</small>.</span></li></ul><p>All of this seems straightforward now, except perhaps the bit about efficient markets. But it was shocking when it was put forward in the early 1950s by Harry Markowitz, who later won the Nobel Prize for it. According to Markowitz, when he explained his theory to the high priests of the Chicago school, “Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small> argued that portfolio theory was not <small>ECONOMICS</small>”. It is now.

<h2>monetarism</h2>
<p>Control the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>, and the rest of the economy will take care of itself. A school of economic thought that developed in opposition to post-1945 <small>KEYNESIAN</small> policies of <small>DEMAND</small> management, echoing earlier debates between <small>MERCANTILISM</small> and <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>. Monetarism is based on the belief that <small>INFLATION</small> has its roots in the <small>GOVERNMENT</small> printing too much money. It is closely associated with Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small>, who argued, based on the <small>QUANTITY THEORY OF MONEY</small>, that government should keep the money supply fairly steady, expanding it slightly each year mainly to allow for the natural <small>GROWTH</small> of the economy. If it did this, market forces would efficiently solve the problems of <small>INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT</small> and <small>RECESSION</small>.</p><p>Monetarism had its heyday in the early 1980s, when economists, governments and investors pounced eagerly on every new money-supply statistic, particularly in the US and the UK. Many <small>CENTRAL BANKS</small> had set formal targets for money-supply growth, so every wiggle in the data was scrutinised for clues to the next move in the rate of <small>INTEREST</small>. Since then, the notion that faster money-supply growth automatically causes higher inflation has fallen out of favour. The money supply is useful as a policy target only if the relationship between money and nominal <small>GDP</small>, and hence inflation, is stable and predictable. The way the money supply affects prices and <small>OUTPUT</small> depends on how fast it circulates through the economy. The trouble is that its <small>VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION</small> can suddenly change. During the 1980s, the link between different measures of the money supply and inflation proved to be less clear than monetarist theories had suggested, and most central banks stopped setting binding monetary targets. Instead, many have adopted explicit inflation targets.</p><p>After the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, central banks around the world tried to minimise the severity of the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> by using a form of monetary policy known as <small>QUANTITATIVE EASING</small> to stimulate growth. How far this was successful, and what its long-term consequences will be, remain topics of great controversy among economists.</p>

<h2>monetary neutrality</h2>
<p>Changes in the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> have no effect on real economic variables such as <small>OUTPUT</small>, real <small>INTEREST RATES</small> and <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. If the <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> doubles the money supply, the <small>PRICE</small> will double too. Twice as many dollars means half as much bang for the buck. This theory, a core belief of <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small>, was first put forward in the 18th century by David Hume. He set out the classical dichotomy that economic variables come in two varieties, nominal and real, and that the things that influence nominal variables do not necessarily affect the real economy. Today, few economists think that pure monetary neutrality exists in the real world, at least in the short run. <small>INFLATION</small> does affect the real economy because, for instance, there may be <small>STICKY PRICES</small> or <small>MONEY ILLUSION</small>.</p>

<h2>monetary policy</h2>
<p>What a <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> does to control the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small>, and thereby manage <small>DEMAND</small>.

<h2>money</h2>
<p>Makes the world go round and comes in many forms, from shells and beads to <small>GOLD</small> coins to plastic, paper or digital bits. It is better than <small>BARTER</small> in enabling an economy’s scarce resources to be allocated efficiently. Money has three main qualities:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">as a medium of exchange, buyers can give it to sellers to pay for goods and <small>SERVICES</small>;</span></li><li><span class="black1">as a unit of account, it can be used to add up apples and oranges in some common value;</span></li><li><span class="black1">as a store of value, it can be used to transfer purchasing power into the future.</span></li></ul><p>A farmer who exchanges fruit for money can spend that money in the future; if he holds on to his fruit, it might rot and no longer be useful for paying for something. <small>INFLATION</small> undermines the usefulness of money as a store of value, in particular, and also as a unit of account for comparing values at different points in time. <small>HYPERINFLATION</small> may destroy confidence in a particular form of money even as a medium of exchange. Measures of <small>LIQUIDITY</small> describe how easily an <small>ASSET</small> can be exchanged for money (the easier this is, the more liquid is the asset).</p><p>For several centuries, <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> have exerted the right to be the <small>MONOPOLY</small> supplier of money in their country. Initially, this money was typically backed by a commodity, such as gold. More recently, commodities have been replaced by “fiat currency” backed only by the good faith of the issuing government. The creation of a privately issued digital currency such as <small>BITCOIN</small> has the potential to challenge established state monopolies over issuing money, if governments allow it.</p>

<h2>money illusion</h2>
<p>When people are misled by <small>INFLATION</small> into thinking that they are getting richer, when in fact the value of <small>MONEY</small> is declining. Whether, and how much, people are fooled by inflation is much debated by economists. Money illusion, a phrase coined by <small>KEYNES</small>, is used by some economists to argue that a small amount of inflation may not be a bad thing and could even be beneficial, helping to “grease the wheels” of the economy. Because of money illusion, workers like to see their nominal <small>WAGES</small> rise, giving them the illusion that their circumstances are improving, even though in real (inflation-adjusted) terms they may be no better off. During periods of high inflation double-digit pay rises (as well as, say, big increases in the value of their homes) can make people feel richer even if they are not really better off. When inflation is low, <small>GROWTH</small> in real incomes may hardly register.</p>

<h2>money supply</h2>
<p>The amount of <small>MONEY</small> available in an economy. In the heyday of <small>MONETARISM</small> in the early 1980s, economists pounced upon the monthly (in some countries, even weekly) money-supply numbers for clues about future <small>INFLATION. CENTRAL BANKS</small> aim to manage <small>DEMAND</small> by controlling the supply of money through <small>OPEN-MARKET OPERATIONS, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS</small> and changing the rate of <small>INTEREST</small> (to be exact, the <small>DISCOUNT RATE</small>). One difficulty for policymakers lies in how to measure the relevant money supply. There are several different methods, reflecting the different <small>LIQUIDITY</small> of various sorts of money. Notes and coins are completely liquid; some <small>BANK</small> deposits cannot be withdrawn until after a waiting period. M3 (M4 in the UK) is known as broad money, and consists of cash, current-account deposits in banks and other financial institutions, <small>SAVINGS</small> deposits and time-restricted deposits. M1 is known as narrow money, and consists mainly of cash in circulation and current-account deposits. M0 (in the UK) is the most liquid measure, including only cash in circulation, cash in banks’ tills and banks’ operational deposits held at the Bank of England.</p><p>Although it is a poor predictor of inflation, monetary <small>GROWTH</small> can be a handy leading indicator of economic activity. In many countries, there is a clear link between the growth of the real broad-money supply and that of real <small>GDP</small>.</p>

<h2>monopolistic competition</h2>
<p>Somewhere between <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> and <small>MONOPOLY</small>, also known as imperfect competition. It describes many real-world markets. Perfectly competitive markets are extremely rare, and few <small>FIRMS</small> enjoy a pure monopoly; <small>OLIGOPOLY</small> is more common. In monopolistic competition, there are fewer firms than in a perfectly competitive market and each can differentiate its products from the rest somewhat, perhaps by <small>ADVERTISING</small> or through small differences in design. These small differences form <small>BARRIERS TO ENTRY</small>. As a result, firms can earn some excess <small>PROFITS</small>, although not as much as a pure monopoly, without a new entrant being able to reduce <small>PRICES</small> through <small>COMPETITION</small>. Prices are higher and <small>OUTPUT</small> lower than under perfect competition.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<a name='name.407'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>monopoly</h2>
<p>When the production of a good or service with no close substitutes is carried out by a single firm with the <small>MARKET POWER</small> to decide the <small>PRICE</small> of its <small>OUTPUT</small>. Contrast with <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small>, in which no single firm can affect the price of what it produces. Typically, a monopoly will produce less, at a higher price, than would be the case for the entire market under perfect competition. It decides its price by calculating the quantity of output at which its <small>MARGINAL</small> revenue would equal its marginal cost, and then sets whatever price would enable it to sell exactly that quantity.</p><p>In practice, few monopolies are absolute, and their power to set prices or limit <small>SUPPLY</small> is constrained by some actual or potential near-competitors (see <small><a href="#name.406">MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION</a></small>). An extreme case of this occurs when a single firm dominates a market but has no pricing power because it is in a <small>CONTESTABLE MARKET</small>; that is, if it does not operate <small>EFFICIENTLY</small>, a more efficient rival firm will take its entire market away. <small>ANTITRUST</small> policy can curb monopoly power by encouraging competition or, when there is a <small>NATURAL MONOPOLY</small> and thus <small>COMPETITION</small> would be inefficient, through <small>REGULATION</small> of prices. Furthermore, the mere possibility of antitrust action may encourage a monopoly to self-regulate its behaviour, simply to avoid the trouble an investigation would bring.</p>

<h2>moral hazard</h2>
<p>One of two main sorts of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small> often associated with the provision of <small>INSURANCE</small>. The other is <small>ADVERSE SELECTION</small>. Moral hazard means that people with insurance may take greater <small>RISKS</small> than they would do without it because they know they are protected, so the insurer may get more claims than it bargained for. (See also <small><a href="#name.142">DEPOSIT INSURANCE</a>, <a href="#name.354">LENDER OF LAST RESORT</a>, <a href="#name.292">IMF</a></small> and <small><a href="#name.728">WORLD BANK</a></small>.) Many economists think that widespread moral hazard in the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> – the result of insurance provided by <small>BANKS</small> to <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> – deserves much of the blame for creating the <small>BUBBLES</small> that, when they burst, helped trigger the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed. Since then, there has been much debate and regulatory action addressing how to discourage banks that are <small>TOO BIG TO FAIL</small> from taking excessive risks.</p>

<h2>most-favoured nation</h2>
<p>Equal treatment, at least, in international trade. If country A grants country B the status of most-favoured nation, it means that B’s <small>EXPORTS</small> will face <small>TARIFFS</small> that are no higher (and also no lower) than those applied to any other country that A calls a most-favoured nation. This will be the most favourable tariff treatment available to <small>IMPORTS</small>.</p><p>Most-favoured-nation treatment is one of the most important building blocks of the international trading system. The <small>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</small> requires member countries to accord the most favourable tariff and regulatory treatment given to the product of any one member to the “like products” of all other members. Before the <small>GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</small>, there was often a most-favoured-nation clause in bilateral trade agreements, which helped the world move towards <small>FREE TRADE</small>. In the 1930s, however, there was a backlash against this, and most-favoured nations were treated less favourably. This shift pushed the world economy towards division into regional trade areas. In the US, most-favoured-nation status has to be re-ratified periodically by Congress, a process that has often given rise to considerable controversy, particularly when it comes to favouring China.</p>

<h2>multiplier</h2>
<p>Shorthand for the way in which a change in spending produces an even larger change in <small>INCOME</small>. For instance, suppose a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> loosens <small>FISCAL POLICY</small>, increasing net <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> by pumping an extra $10 billion into education. This has an immediate effect by increasing the income of teachers and of people who sell educational supplies or build or maintain schools. These people will in turn spend some of their extra <small>MONEY</small>, putting more cash into the pockets of others, who spend some of it, and so on.</p><p>In theory, this process could continue indefinitely, in which case the multiplier would have an infinite value. In practice, most people save some of their extra income rather than spend it. How much they spend will depend on their <small>MARGINAL PROPENSITY</small> to consume. The value of the multiplier can be calculated by this formula:</p><p>multiplier = 1 (1 – marginal propensity to consume)</p><p>If the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5 (50 cents of an extra dollar), the multiplier is 2. In practice, it is often hard to measure the multiplier effect, or to predict how it will respond to, say, changes in <small>MONETARY POLICY</small> or fiscal policy.</p>

<p>Creating a country that works out of one that does not – because the old order has collapsed (as in the former Soviet bloc), or been destroyed by war (Iraq), or never really functioned in the first place (Afghanistan).

<h2>nationalisation</h2>
<p>When a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> takes ownership of a private-sector business. Nationalisation was a fashionable part of the mix in countries with a <small>MIXED ECONOMY</small> between 1945 and 1980, after which the <small>PRIVATISATION</small> of state-owned <small>FIRMS</small> became increasingly popular. The amount of public ownership in different countries has always varied considerably. Nationalisation has taken place for various reasons, ranging from socialist ideology to attempts to remedy examples of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>.</p><p>The performance of nationalised firms has often, but not always, been poor compared with their private-sector counterparts. State-owned businesses often enjoy a legally protected <small>MONOPOLY</small>, and the lack of <small>COMPETITION</small> means the firms face little pressure to be efficient. Politicians often interfere in important management decisions, making it harder to take unpopular actions on pay, factory closures and job cuts, particularly when there are strong public-sector trade <small>UNIONS</small> and a union-friendly government. Politically imposed financial constraints may also force public-sector firms to underinvest.</p><p>Although privatisation has not been universally beneficial, on balance it has increased economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small>. Yet despite the spread of privatisation policies around the world since the 1980s, there remains a huge volume of state-owned business. According to a study published in 2015, the global pool of public “commercial” <small>ASSETS</small> (controlling government stakes in companies, property and the like) was worth $75 trillion, twice the world’s total <small>PENSION SAVINGS</small>.</p>

<h2>natural monopoly</h2>
<p>When a <small>MONOPOLY</small> occurs because it is more efficient for one firm to serve an entire market than for two or more <small>FIRMS</small> to do so, because of the sort of <small>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</small> available in that market. A common example is water distribution, in which the main cost is laying a network of pipes to deliver water. One firm can do the job at a lower <small>AVERAGE</small> cost per customer than two firms with competing networks of pipes. Industries with strong <small>NETWORK EFFECTS</small> tend towards natural monopoly. Monopolies can arise unnaturally by a firm acquiring sole ownership of a resource that is essential to the production of a good or service, or by a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> granting a firm the legal right to be the sole producer. Other unnatural monopolies occur when a firm is much more efficient than its rivals for reasons other than economies of scale. Unlike some other sorts of monopoly, natural monopolies have little chance of being driven out of a market by more efficient new entrants. Thus <small>REGULATION</small> of natural monopolies may be needed to protect their captive consumers.</p>

<h2>natural rate of unemployment</h2>
<p>A controversial phrase, which actually means little more than the lowest rate of <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> at which the jobs market can be in stable <small>EQUILIBRIUM. KEYNESIANS</small>, encouraged by the <small>PHILLIPS CURVE</small>, assumed that a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> could lower the rate of unemployment if it was willing to accept a little more <small>INFLATION</small>. However, economists such as Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small> and Edmund Phelps, both of whom later won the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>, argued that this supposed inflation-for-jobs trade-off was a trap. Governments that tolerated higher inflation in the hope of lowering unemployment would find that joblessness dipped only briefly before returning to its previous level, while inflation would rise and stay high. Instead, they argued, unemployment has an equilibrium or natural rate, determined not by the amount of <small>DEMAND</small> in an economy but by the structure of the <small>LABOUR</small> market. This is the lowest level of unemployment at which inflation will remain stable. When unemployment is above the natural rate demand can potentially be increased to bring it to the natural rate, but attempting to lower it even further will only cause inflation to accelerate. Hence the natural rate is also known as the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.</p><p>At first, the NAIRU became synonymous with the view that <small>MACROECONOMIC POLICY</small> could not conquer unemployment. It was often used to justify policy inaction even when unemployment rose to more than 10% of workers in industrialised countries during the 1980s and 1990s, although economists’ estimates of the NAIRU differed hugely. More recently, economists looking for ways to reduce unemployment have started to ask whether, and under what circumstances, the natural rate might change. Most solutions have stressed the need to make more people employable at the prevailing level of <small>WAGES</small>, in particular by increasing <small>LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY</small>. Economists still disagree over what jobless rate at any particular point in time is the NAIRU, but nobody any longer thinks that the natural rate is fixed. Indeed, some think the concept has no meaning at all.</p>

<h2>negative income tax</h2>
<p>A way of building redistribution into the <small>TAXATION</small> system by taking <small>MONEY</small> from people with high <small>INCOMES</small> and paying it to people with low incomes. Because it takes place automatically through the tax system, in theory it should attach less stigma to the receipt of financial help than some other forms of <small>WELFARE</small> assistance. However, it might also discourage recipients from working to increase their income (see <small><a href="#name.699">UNEMPLOYMENT TRAP</a></small>), which is why some countries have introduced a form of negative income tax that is available only to the working poor. In the US, this is known as the earned income tax credit.</p>

<p>A measure used to help decide whether or not to proceed with an <small>INVESTMENT</small>. Net means that both the costs and benefits of the investment are included. To calculate net present value (NPV), first add together all the expected benefits from the investment, now and in the future. Then add together all the expected costs. Then work out what these future benefits and costs are worth now by using an appropriate <small>DISCOUNT RATE</small>. Then subtract the costs from the benefits. If the NPV is negative, the investment cannot be justified by the <small>EXPECTED RETURNS</small>. If the NPV is positive, it can, although it pays to make comparisons with the NPVs of other investment opportunities before going ahead.</p>

<h2>network effect</h2>
<p>When the value of a good to a consumer changes because the number of people using it changes. For instance, owning a phone becomes more valuable as more people are plugged into the phone network. Network effects are sometimes called network <small>EXTERNALITIES</small>, although this implies, often wrongly, that the benefits from being part of a network are a sort of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>. They give a huge <small>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</small> to the firm that owns the network. This <small>INCUMBENT ADVANTAGE</small> arises because a new entrant must persuade people to join a network that starts with fewer members, and thus may be less valuable to them than the network they are currently in. This is why markets for products with network effects are often dominated by only a few <small>FIRMS</small> or a single <small>MONOPOLY</small>, which may be a <small>NATURAL MONOPOLY</small>. Some economists argue that many recent technological <small>INNOVATIONS</small>, notably the internet, have large positive network effects, which make possible much higher <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> and <small>GROWTH</small> than in the past.</p>

<h2>neuroeconomics</h2>
<p>A school of <small>ECONOMICS</small> that tries to explain the economic decisions people take by studying the chemical processes of the brain. Since the late 1990s, neuroeconomists have studied economic decisions using recently developed techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which show that different bits of the old grey matter are associated with different sorts of emotional and decision-making activity. Already they have examined issues such as people’s reasons for trusting one another, apparently irrational <small>RISK</small>-taking, the relative valuation of short-term and long-term costs and benefits, altruistic or charitable behaviour, and addiction.</p><p>Releases of dopamine, the brain’s pleasure chemical, may indicate economic <small>UTILITY</small> or value, they say. There is also growing interest in new evidence from neuroscience which tentatively suggests that two conditions of the brain compete in decision-making: a cold, objective state and a hot, emotional state in which the ability to make sensible trade-offs disappears. The potential interactions between these two brain states are ideal subjects for economic modelling.</p><p>Some economists are sceptical, arguing that economists do not need brains (as it were). Studying what people decide – their <small>REVEALED PREFERENCE</small> – is sufficient. Yet today’s neuroeconomists are not the first dismal scientists to dream of peering inside the human brain. In 1881, Francis Edgeworth proposed the creation of a “hedonometer”, which would measure the utility that each individual gained from their decisions. The technology to make this instrument was not available then, but it seems more plausible today.</p>

<h2>new economy</h2>
<p>In the last years of the 20th century, some economists argued that developments in information technology and <small>GLOBALISATION</small> had given birth to a “new economy” (first in the US), which had a higher rate of <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> and <small>GROWTH</small> than the old economy it replaced. Some went further, adding that in the new economy <small>INFLATION</small> was dead, the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small> abolished and the traditional rules of <small>ECONOMICS</small> were redundant. These claims were highly controversial. Other economists point out that similar predictions had been made during earlier periods of rapid technological change, yet the nature of economics was not fundamentally altered. With the bursting of the dotcom stockmarket <small>BUBBLE</small> in 2000, the phrase fell into disuse, although productivity continued to soar, thanks not least to new technology, especially in the US.</p>

<h2>new trade theory</h2>
<p>Although most economists support <small>FREE TRADE</small>, in the 1970s a growing number of them became increasingly puzzled by the large differences between the predictions of free-trade theory and real-world trade flows. Their solution to this puzzle is known as new trade theory.</p><p>One mystery was that trade was growing fastest between industrial countries with similar economies and endowments of the <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small>. In many new industries, there was no clear <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small> for any country. Patterns of production and trade often seemed matters of chance. Trade between two countries would often consist mostly of similar goods; for example, one country would sell cars to another country from which it would import different models of cars.</p><p>One explanation, associated in particular with Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drew on Adam <small>SMITH’S</small> idea that the division of labour lowers unit costs. <small>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</small> within <small>FIRMS</small> are incompatible with the <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> assumed by traditional trade theory. A more realistic assumption is that many markets have <small>MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION</small>. When a monopolistically competitive market expands, it does so through a mixture of more firms (greater product variety) and bigger firms, with bigger-scale economies. Free trade expands market size beyond national borders and so allows firms to reap bigger economies of scale, to the benefit of consumers, workers and shareholders.</p><p>The upside may be greater the more similar the trading economies. This may explain why trade <small>LIBERALISATION</small> is easier to achieve between similar countries. Thus, for example, the free-trade agreement between the US and Canada produced only minor local complaints, whereas its subsequent expansion to include the very different economy of Mexico was much more controversial (see <small><a href="#name.413">NAFTA</a></small>).</p>

<h2>NGO</h2>
<p>Short for non-government organisation. Although such groups have existed for generations (in the early 1800s, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society played a powerful part in abolishing slavery laws), recent social and economic shifts have given these typically non-<small>PROFIT</small> organisations new life. No one knows the exact number of NGOs, but there are reckoned to be at least 1 million in both the US and India, each of these countries accounting for around one-fifth of the global total.</p><p>NGOs have grown rapidly in both number and size for several reasons:</p><ul><li><span class="black1"><small>GOVERNMENTS</small> have struggled increasingly to meet social needs, and so <small>NGOS</small> have stepped in to fill the gap as providers of <small>SERVICES</small>.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Even when governments have tried to address a particular social need, they have done so ineffectively, and more creative social <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small> within <small>NGOS</small> have found better solutions.</span></li><li><span class="black1">Citizens have increasingly sought to improve how they hold governments and firms to account for their impact on society and to encourage them to do better, and (mostly) <small>NGOS</small> have been their preferred organisational form for doing so.</span></li></ul><p>Governments have been at the sharp end of pressure from campaigning NGOs. Arguably, however, it is intergovernmental institutions such as the <small>WORLD BANK</small>, the <small>IMF</small>, other <small>UN</small> agencies and the <small>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</small> (WTO) that have felt it more, owing to their lack of political leverage. Few parliamentarians will face direct pressure from the IMF or the WTO, but every policymaker faces pressure from citizens’ groups with special interests. Add to this the poor public image that these technocratic, faceless bureaucracies have developed, and it is hardly surprising that they are popular targets for NGO “swarms”. How governments and intergovernmental organisations respond to NGOs could have huge implications, including for the world’s economies.</p><p>Equally important will be how NGOs themselves respond to greater scrutiny and to growing concern about how accountable they are, and to whom. Nor is it just their accountability, or lack of it, that is attracting scrutiny. So, too, is their <small>EFFICIENCY</small>, or, more often, inefficiency. The growth of the NGO sector has drawn attention to its economic importance – over 10% of jobs in the US now are with non-profits – which in turn has raised questions about how well it uses the economic resources it controls. Compared with for-profit firms, NGOs are often small, lacking in <small>TRANSPARENCY</small> and inefficient. They often lack both the resources to grow large and (however poorly they perform) the market pressure to go out of business.</p><p>Nevertheless, in recent years a growing number of NGOs have become <small>SOCIAL ENTERPRISES</small>, engaging in business activities to generate <small>INCOME</small> to fund their activities. In many cases, this has improved their efficiency. Also, the rise of <small>PHILANTHROCAPITALISM</small> has seen a new wave of wealthy philanthropists apply their <small>MONEY</small> and business skills to trying to improve the performance of NGOs, often working in partnership with social entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>nudge</h2>
<p>Liberal paternalism. Policies that draw on insights from <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small> to encourage (nudge) people to do things that the policymaker wants them to do, in contrast to old-fashioned illiberal paternalism that simply requires or forces them to comply. Inspired by a 2009 book, <i>Nudge,</i> by two economists, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, several <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> have introduced so-called nudge units tasked with proposing such interventions, which have typically been introduced initially as small experiments tested with <small>RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS</small>.</p><p>One notable early success in the UK prompted non-payers to pay unpaid tax by informing them that most people pay taxes on time, thereby making them aware that they did not comply with a prevailing social norm. Sending personal text messages helps nudge people to remain in public programmes, such as literacy or numeracy programmes for young adults. In the US, sending eight text-message reminders led to a nearly 9% increase in college enrolment among low-income students; and personalised letters to farmers that included a tailored set of action steps to apply for a <small>GOVERNMENT</small> loan increased the number of farmers obtaining a loan by 22%. In Singapore, printing tax bills on the pink paper typically used for <small>DEBT</small> collection led to an improvement in the prompt payment rate of between 3 and 5 <small>PERCENTAGE POINTS</small>.</p><p>Policymakers hope that nudges can both improve public <small>SERVICES</small> and save <small>MONEY</small>. But they have their limits. The sums saved or generated are small relative to public-sector <small>BUDGETS</small>. Moreover, there is little evidence of governments’ willingness to spend heavily up front on a nudge in the hope of making big savings later. It is easy to persuade a government to experiment when the intervention is as cheap as changing the wording of a letter, but much more difficult when it involves bigger, riskier changes that may not only cost a fortune but also harm its reputation if all goes wrong.</p>

<h2>oil</h2>
<p>Sharp increases in the <small>PRICE</small> of oil have had huge economic consequences over the years. In the 1970s, driven up by the <small>OPEC CARTEL</small>, oil prices were a big contributor to <small>INFLATION</small> and <small>STAGFLATION</small> problems in the leading industrial economies. Many <small>MANUFACTURING</small> operations were rendered obsolete, and were replaced eventually by new plant that was far more efficient in its consumption of oil, or relied on other fuels.</p><p>In July 2008, the oil price surged to a record high in nominal terms (for US crude) of $145 a barrel. Although it fell after the financial <small>CRASH</small>, it bounced back to $100 in January 2011, and remained above $90 until the middle of 2014, after which it plunged to as low as $26 in February 2016. There was widespread disagreement among economists as to why the price had soared, and later why it had dropped so sharply again. Certainly, this time OPEC was not the primary cause of higher prices (though there are suggestions that politically driven excessive <small>SUPPLY</small> of oil by Saudi Arabia, arguably the leading OPEC nation, helped drive prices down after 2014). Stronger demand from <small>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</small>, especially from China, may also have helped instil a more resilient culture. Economists disagreed on what was responsible: rising <small>DEMAND</small>, certainly, but also, according to some, rampant <small>SPECULATION</small> by <small>HEDGE FUNDS</small> and other financial investors. There was talk, though not much evidence, that global oil production had peaked. Two main beneficiaries of high oil prices were <small>SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS</small> established by oil-producing countries, which could suddenly afford to invest in some of the world’s most respected firms, and companies developing alternative energy, especially environmentally friendly, non-climate-changing “clean tech”.</p><p>More recently, declines in the oil price have been blamed not only on excess supply from Saudi Arabia but also falling demand from emerging economies as they mature, and from the rapid growth of oil and gas production in the US, which rose by around 80% in 2008–15 as a result of innovative new extraction methods such as fracking. In 2015, the US, by now in effect self-sufficient in oil, lifted its ban on exporting the stuff, further hurting the world market <small>PRICE</small>.</p>

Likewise, a lesser, say 2%, increase in GDP would be associated with a half a percentage point increase in the jobless rate.</p><p>This relationship is not carved in stone, as it merely reflects the US economy during the period studied by Okun.

A lot of productive capital equipment that had been viable at lower oil prices proved to be unprofitable to run at the higher prices and was shut down. Some economists reckon that market forces would have driven up oil prices anyway and that OPEC merely capitalised on the opportunity.</p><p>Since the early 1980s, OPEC’s influence has waned. Many firms have switched to production methods that need less oil, or less energy altogether. Non-OPEC producers such as the UK and the US have brought new oil fields on stream. And some of the 13 nations that are members of the cartel have broken ranks by failing to co-ordinate their oil production with other members. Increasingly, OPEC has found itself responding to sharp surges and falls in oil prices, rather than driving them, although the weakness in the oil price that began in 2014 seems to have been caused partly by Saudi Arabia, one of the leading OPEC members, refusing requests from some other members to curb its <small>SUPPLY</small> of oil to the market.</p>

This may not be an insuperable problem if workers in the affected country are able and willing to move freely to other countries; if <small>WAGES</small> and prices are flexible and can adjust to the shock; or if <small>FISCAL POLICY</small> can shift resources to areas hurt by a shock from areas that are not hurt.</p><p>For a currency area to be optimal, ideally asymmetric shocks should be rare, implying that the economies involved are on similar <small>BUSINESS CYCLES</small> and have similar structures. Moreover, the single monetary policy should affect all the constituent parts in the same way (an <small>INTEREST RATE</small> cut should not, say, reduce <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> in one part and increase <small>INFLATION</small> in another). There should be no cultural, linguistic or legal barriers to <small>LABOUR</small> mobility across frontiers; there should be wage flexibility; and there should be some system for transferring resources to regions that are suffering. In practice, few of the parts of the world that have a single currency are optimal currency areas, although having a single currency often makes them become gradually more alike and thus more optimal.</p><p>The US was not an optimal currency area, and fought a civil war before putting in place the federal fiscal support mechanisms that made a federal dollar bearable. The <small>EURO ZONE</small> has never seemed to meet the criteria for an optimal currency area, and as a result seemed close to breaking several times in the years after the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008. The economies of the member countries seemed too different, whilst the political mechanisms necessary to relieve the strain caused by a single monetary policy were neither in place nor easy to add in a crisis.</p>

<h2>patents</h2>
<p>In 1899 the commissioner of the American Office of Patents recommended that his office be abolished because “everything that can be invented has been invented”. The fact that there has been so much <small>INNOVATION</small> during the subsequent 100-plus years may owe something to the existence of patents. Economists reckon that if people are going to spend the time and <small>MONEY</small> needed to think up and develop new products, they need to be fairly confident that if the idea works they will earn a decent <small>PROFIT</small>. Patents help achieve this by granting the inventor a temporary <small>MONOPOLY</small> over the idea, to stop it being stolen by imitators who have not borne any of the development <small>RISK</small> and costs. Like any monopoly, patents create inefficiency because of the lack of <small>COMPETITION</small> to produce and sell the product. So economists debate how long patent protection should last. There is also debate about which sorts of innovation require the encouragement of a potential monopoly to make them happen. Furthermore, the pace of innovation in some industries has sharply reduced the number of years during which a patent is valuable. Some economists argue that this shows that patents do not play a large part in the process of innovation.</p>

One focus of this debate is the QWERTY keyboard. Some argue that the QWERTY design was deliberately made slow to use so as to overcome a jamming-at-speed problem in early typewriters. Much faster alternative layouts of keys have failed to prosper, even though the anti-jamming rationale for QWERTY has been defunct for years. Others say that the QWERTY system is as efficient a layout of keys as any other and that its success is a triumph of <small>MARKET FORCES</small>. Having invested in learning to make and use the QWERTY keyboard, it makes no economic sense to switch to an alternative that is no better than QWERTY</p>

<h2>pensions</h2>
<p>An <small>INCOME</small> once you have retired; sometimes bought with your personal <small>SAVINGS</small> while working, sometimes paid by the state. Germany’s chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, introduced the first state pension in 1889. Since then, most countries have introduced a basic pension for retired people, typically paid for in any given year out of tax revenues for that year. This can create problems when the “dependency ratio” of retirees to current workers rises, say because of a sharp fall in the birth rate, leaving current workers having to pay for the retirement income of a larger group of retirees. When the first state pension was introduced, the age at which it was received was 70, 25 years older than the typical person was expected to live. Today, increasing longevity has meant that on <small>AVERAGE</small> many years pass between retirement and death, which in many countries has pushed the cost of state pensions well above what was expected when they were introduced. The best way to reduce this cost is to increase the retirement age – though the unpopularity of doing so with older people, who tend to vote more reliably than younger people, can make it politically difficult. Creating an automatic link between the retirement age and changes in life expectancy may be the most acceptable way to do this.</p><p><small>GOVERNMENTS</small> often provide incentives to persuade people to top up their pension by saving for retirement through private schemes, and to encourage employers to contribute to pensions for their workers. In recent years, there has been a sharp shift away from so-called “defined benefit plans”, which promise a certain pension regardless of the financial return generated by contributions to the pension plan while working, to “defined contribution plans”, which pay a pension whose size is determined by how much the contributions made while working have earned once invested. The wisdom of this shift has been questioned by some economists, who argue that it creates greater uncertainty about how much people will have to live on in old age, making prudent financial planning harder, and relies too much on typically financially illiterate individuals deciding how best to invest for retirement. There are growing fears that the generation of ageing people who have been paying into defined contribution schemes, especially in the US, have not squirrelled away enough to buy an adequate pension, which may mean that many of them will never have the financial means to be able to fully retire.</p>

<h2>platform economics</h2>
<p>A company that profits by creating a platform on which others can generate value has some distinct advantages over other sorts of <small>FIRMS</small>, especially if it is hard for the firms using it to switch to another platform (say, because the platform benefits from <small>NETWORK EFFECTS</small>). Apple’s app store is a classic platform business: the firm takes a 30% cut from revenues generated by companies selling products through the store. Uber is another, taking a cut of every fare earned by drivers introduced to their passengers via its marketplace platform.</p><p>The opportunity to create a platform is greatest when there exists what is known as a “two-sided market”, where the platform can provide benefits simultaneously to two distinct groups of user. Credit-card providers have long been a platform serving merchants and consumers by making it easier for them to trade, just as Uber does for drivers and passengers and Airbnb does for people with spare rooms and travellers looking for somewhere to sleep. The key to being a platform is enabling the two sides of the market to interact directly with each other, without any need for the platform provider to play an overt role in brokering the trade. Uber has faced lawsuits challenging its claim to be a platform from drivers who want to be treated as Uber employees (and thus be entitled to benefits such as paid holidays), rather than as independent business people who happen to use Uber as a trading platform. If the drivers win, Uber is likely to be much less profitable in the <small>LONG RUN</small>.</p>

<h2>Ponzi scheme</h2>
<p>In 1920, Charles Ponzi, an Italian businessman and con artist, promised to double investors’ money in three months.

Perhaps the most notorious example of a Ponzi scheme was perpetrated by Bernie Madoff, a Wall Street money manager whose scam, revealed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial <small>CRASH</small>, is reckoned to have cost investors at least $10 billion (and perhaps far more than that) and him his freedom for the rest of his life, thanks to a jail sentence of 150 years.</p>

<h2>poverty</h2>
<p>The state of being poor, which depends on how you define it. One approach is to use some absolute measure. For instance, the poverty rate refers to the number of households whose <small>INCOME</small> is less than three times what is needed to provide an adequate diet. (Though what constitutes adequate may change over time.) Another is to measure relative poverty. For instance, the number of people in poverty can be defined as all households with an income of less than, say, half the <small>AVERAGE</small> household income. Or the (relative) poverty line may be defined as the level of income below which are, say, the poorest 10% of households. In each case, the dividing line between poverty and not-quite poverty is somewhat arbitrary.</p><p>As countries get richer, the number of people in absolute poverty usually gets smaller. This is not necessarily true of the numbers in relative poverty. The way that relative poverty is defined means that it is always likely to identify a large number of impoverished households. However rich a country becomes, there will always be 10% of households poorer than the rest, even though they may live in mansions and eat caviar (albeit smaller mansions and less caviar than the other 90% of households).</p><p>The ambition to halve the number of people living in extreme poverty was one of the more successful of the <small>UN</small> Millennium Development Goals for 2000–15. From 1999 to 2015, the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 1.75 billion to 836 million. A large part of this progress was a result of growing incomes in China thanks to its rapid industrialisation. Further reductions in extreme poverty are part of the new <small>GLOBAL GOALS</small> adopted in 2015.</p><p>Income is not necessarily the best measure of poverty. Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, has developed a measure of “multi-dimensional poverty” which reflects the many different problems people can face at the same time as a shortage of <small>MONEY</small>. These include bad health, inadequate shelter and a lack of education. The leading measure of multi-dimensional poverty uses ten indicators; if people are deprived in at least one-third of them, they are multi-dimensionally poor. By this measure, about twice as many people are living in extreme poverty than when poverty is measured using income alone.</p>

<h2>price</h2>
<p>In <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>, what balances <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small>. The price charged for something depends on the tastes, <small>INCOME</small> and <small>ELASTICITY</small> of demand of customers. It depends on the amount of <small>COMPETITION</small> in the market. Under <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small>, all <small>FIRMS</small> are price takers. Where there is a <small>MONOPOLY</small>, or firms have some <small>MARKET POWER</small>, the seller has some control over the price, which will probably be higher than in a perfectly competitive market. By how much more will depend on how much market power there is, and on whether the firm(s) with the market power are committed to <small>PROFIT MAXIMISATION</small>. In some cases, firms may charge less than the profit-maximising price for strategic or other reasons (see <small><a href="#name.486">PREDATORY PRICING</a></small>).</p>

<h2>price discrimination</h2>
<p>When a firm charges different customers different <small>PRICES</small> for the same product. For producers, the perfect world would be one in which they could charge each customer a different price: the price that each customer would be willing to pay. This would maximise <small>PRODUCER SURPLUS</small>. This cannot happen, not least because sellers do not know how much any individual would pay.</p><p>Yet some price discrimination is possible if an overall market can be segmented into somewhat separate markets and the <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small> price in each of these markets is different, perhaps because of differences in consumer tastes, perhaps because in some segments the firm enjoys some market power. But this will work only if the market segments can be kept apart. If it is possible and profitable to buy the product in a low-price segment and resell it in a high-price segment, price discrimination will not last for long.</p>

<h2>price/earnings ratio</h2>
<p>A crude method of judging whether <small>SHARES</small> are cheap or expensive; the ratio of the market <small>PRICE</small> of a share to the company’s earnings (<small>PROFIT</small>) per share. The higher the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, the more investors are buying a company’s shares in the expectation that it will make larger profits in future than now. In other words, the higher the P/E ratio, the more optimistic investors are being.</p>

<h2>prisoner’s dilemma</h2>
<p>A favourite example in <small>GAME THEORY</small>, which shows why co-operation is difficult to achieve even when it is mutually beneficial. Two prisoners have been arrested for the same offence and are held in different cells. Each has two options: confess, or say nothing. There are three possible outcomes. One could confess and agree to testify against the other as state witness, receiving a light sentence while his fellow prisoner receives a heavy sentence. They can both say nothing and may be lucky and get light sentences or even be let off, owing to lack of firm evidence. Or they can both confess and probably get lighter individual sentences than one would have received had he said nothing and the other had testified against him. The second outcome would be the best for both prisoners. However, the <small>RISK</small> that the other might confess and turn state witness is likely to encourage both to confess, landing both with sentences that they might have avoided had they been able to co-operate in remaining silent. In an <small>OLIGOPOLY, FIRMS</small> often behave like these prisoners, not setting <small>PRICES</small> as high as they could do if they only trusted the other firms not to undercut them. As a result, they are worse off.</p>

<h2>private equity</h2>
<p>When a firm’s <small>SHARES</small> are held privately and not traded in the public markets. Private <small>EQUITY</small> includes shares both in mature private companies and, as <small>VENTURE CAPITAL</small>, in newly started businesses. As it is less liquid than publicly traded equity, investors in private equity expect on average to earn a higher <small>EQUITY RISK PREMIUM</small> from it.</p><p>Private equity first boomed during the 1980s, when partnerships such as KKR undertook high-profile <small>LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS</small>, the name then given to private equity. After crashing at the end of that decade, and recovering slowly, it boomed again at the start of the 21st century, reaching an unprecedented scale, only to suffer a sharp but temporary decline as access to <small>CREDIT</small> evaporated in the run up to the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and in the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed. By 2014, private-equity firms managed around $2.6 trillion, double what they had in 2008.</p><p>Some economists argue that private equity investors create <small>PROFIT</small> by taking on extra <small>RISK</small> as they borrow to buy <small>FIRMS</small> and by cutting costs aggressively; others say that it improves economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small> by reducing the <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> in the firms owned by private equity through much more effective corporate <small>GOVERNANCE</small> than is typical in public companies. Certainly, private equity is not subject to <small>SHORT-TERMIST</small> pressures such as shareholder activism that, it is argued by some economists, have often led publicly traded companies to underinvest in long-term value creation.</p>

<h2>privatisation</h2>
<p>Selling state-owned businesses to private investors. This policy was associated initially with Margaret Thatcher’s <small>GOVERNMENT</small> in the 1980s, which privatised numerous companies, including <small>PUBLIC UTILITY</small> businesses such as British Telecom, British Gas, and electricity and water companies. During the 1990s, privatisation became a favourite policy of governments all over the world.</p><p>There were several reasons for the popularity of privatisation. In some instances, the aim was to improve the performance of publicly owned companies. Often <small>NATIONALISATION</small> had failed to achieve its goals and had become increasingly associated with poor service to customers. Sometimes privatisation was part of transforming a state-owned <small>MONOPOLY</small> into a competitive market, by combining ownership transfer with <small>DEREGULATION</small> and <small>LIBERALISATION</small>, which sometimes involved new forms of <small>REGULATION</small>. Sometimes it offered a way to raise new <small>CAPITAL</small> for the firm to invest in improving its service, <small>MONEY</small> that was not available in the public sector because of constraints on <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small>.</p><p>Sometimes, shamefully, it was a way of transferring valuable public <small>ASSETS</small> cheaply to private-sector friends of the government, as arguably happened, for example, in Russia’s kleptocratic privatisation process under Boris Yeltsin. Indeed, perhaps the main attraction of privatisation to many politicians was that the proceeds from it could ease the pressure on the public purse. As a result, they could avoid (in the short term) doing the more painful things necessary to improve the fiscal position, such as raising taxes or cutting public spending.</p>

<h2>probability</h2>
<p>How likely something is to happen, usually expressed as the ratio of the number of ways the outcome may occur to the number of total possible outcomes for the event. For instance, each time you throw a dice there are six possible outcomes, but in only one of these can a six come up. Thus the probability of throwing a six on any given throw is one in six. The fact that you threw a six last time does not alter the one-in-six probability of throwing a six next time (see <small><a href="#name.571">RISK</a></small>).</p>

<h2>production function</h2>
<p>A mathematical way to describe the relationship between the quantity of inputs used by a firm and the quantity of <small>OUTPUT</small> it produces with them. If the amount of inputs needed to produce one more unit of output is less than was needed to produce the last unit of output, the firm is enjoying increasing <small>RETURNS</small> to scale (or increasing <small>MARGINAL</small> product).

<h2>productivity</h2>
<p>The relationship between inputs and <small>OUTPUT</small>, which can be applied to individual <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small> or collectively. <small>LABOUR</small> productivity is the most widely used measure and is usually calculated by dividing total output by the number of workers or the number of hours worked. Total factor productivity attempts to measure the overall productivity of the inputs used by a firm or a country.</p><p>Alas, the usefulness of productivity statistics is questionable. The quality of different inputs can change significantly over time. There can also be significant differences in the mix of inputs. Furthermore, <small>FIRMS</small> and countries may use different definitions of their inputs, especially <small>CAPITAL</small>.</p><p>That said, much of the difference in countries’ living standards reflects differences in their productivity. Usually, the higher their productivity the better, but this is not always so. In the UK during the 1980s, labour productivity rose sharply, leading some economists to talk of a “productivity miracle”. Others disagreed, saying that productivity had risen because <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> had risen – in other words, the least productive workers had been removed from the figures on which the <small>AVERAGE</small> was calculated.</p><p>There was a similar debate in the US starting in the late 1990s. Initially, economists doubted that a productivity miracle was taking place. But by 2003, they conceded that during the previous five years the US enjoyed the fastest productivity <small>GROWTH</small> in any such period since the second world war. Over the whole period from 1995 to 2003, labour productivity growth averaged almost 3% a year, twice the average rate over the previous two decades. That did not stop economists debating why the miracle had occurred.</p>

<h2>profit</h2>
<p>The main reason <small>FIRMS</small> exist. In economic theory, profit is the reward for <small>RISK</small> taken by <small>ENTERPRISE</small>, the fourth of the <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small> – what is left after all other costs, including <small>RENT, WAGES</small> and <small>INTEREST</small>. Put simply, profit is a firm’s total revenue minus total cost.</p><p>Economists distinguish between normal profit and excess profit. Normal profit is the <small>OPPORTUNITY COST</small> of the <small>ENTREPRENEUR</small>, the amount of profit just sufficient to keep the firm in business. If profit is any lower than that, enterprise would be better off engaged in some other economic activity. Excess profit, also known as super-normal profit, is profit above normal profit and is usually evidence that the firm enjoys some market power that allows it to be more profitable than it would be in a market with <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small>.</p>

The average propensity to consume is simply total <small>CONSUMPTION</small> divided by total <small>INCOME</small>. The marginal propensity to consume measures how much of each extra dollar of income is consumed: the percentage change in consumption divided by the percentage change in income. The value of the marginal propensity to consume, which determines the <small>MULTIPLIER</small>, is harder to predict than the value of the average propensity to consume.</p>

<h2>property rights</h2>
<p>Essential to any market economy. To trade, it is essential to know that the person selling a good or service owns it and that ownership will pass to the buyer. The stronger and clearer property rights are, the more likely it is that trade will take place and that <small>PRICES</small> will be efficient. If there are no property rights over something, there can be severe consequences. A solution to the costly <small>EXTERNALITY</small> of clean air being polluted may be to establish property rights over the air, so that the owner can charge the polluter to pump smoke into the atmosphere.</p><p>Private property rights are often more economically efficient than common ownership. When people do not own something directly, they may have little incentive to look after it (see <small><a href="#name.685">TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS</a></small>). Strikingly, in Russia after <small>COMMUNISM</small>, the establishment of a well-functioning market economy proved difficult, partly because it was unclear who owned many of the country’s resources, and those property rights that did exist often counted for little. Businesses would often have their products stolen by criminal gangs or be forced to hand over most of their <small>PROFIT</small> in protection money. It is no coincidence that an effective judicial system, as well as property rights for it to enforce, is a feature of advanced market economies. Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, has argued persuasively that the lack of enforceable property rights in informal economies is a reason why such economies tend not to grow; giving poor people meaningful property rights can be a catalyst for faster economic development in their communities.</p><p>That said, nowhere are property rights absolute. For instance, <small>TAXATION</small> is a clear example of the state infringing taxpayers’ ownership of their <small>MONEY. GOVERNMENTS</small> sometimes exercise their right of “eminent domain” (known as compulsory purchase in some countries) to take control of privately owned land. The economic cost of infringing property rights underlines how important it is that governments think carefully about the consequences for economic growth of their tax policies.</p>

<h2>prospect theory</h2>
<p>A theory of “irrational” economic behaviour. Prospect theory holds that there are recurring biases driven by psychological factors that influence people’s choices under uncertainty. In particular, it assumes that people are more motivated by losses than by gains and as a result will devote more energy to avoiding loss than to achieving gain. The theory is based on the experimental work of two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman (who won the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small> for it) and Amos Tversky.

<h2>public-private</h2>
<p>When private <small>FIRMS, NGOS</small> or individuals such as philanthropists partner with <small>GOVERNMENT</small>. This has become increasingly popular since the early 1980s as governments have tried to obtain some of the benefits of the private sector without going as far as full <small>PRIVATISATION</small>. Some of the biggest <small>EFFICIENCY</small> gains have come when <small>SERVICES</small> have been allocated to private firms through competitive bidding. The gains have been smallest, and arguably even negative, in cases when the main contribution of the private firm has been to raise finance. This is because governments can usually borrow more cheaply than private firms, so when they ask them to raise money the question that springs to mind is: are they doing this to make their public borrowing look smaller?</p><p>More recently, the rise of NGOs and <small>PHILANTHROCAPITALISM</small> has led to new sorts of public-private partnerships that draw on the entrepreneurship of philanthropists and <small>SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS</small> to develop more innovative solutions than are often forthcoming when problems are addressed by government acting alone. In the <small>DIVISION OF LABOUR</small> at the heart of these partnerships, which include <small>SOCIAL-IMPACT BONDS</small>, government often benefits most when it concentrates on providing the funds while its private-sector partners focus on doing things in more efficient, innovative ways.</p>

<h2>purchasing power parity</h2>
<p>A method for calculating the correct value of a currency, which may differ from its current market value. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is helpful when comparing living standards in different countries, as it indicates the appropriate <small>EXCHANGE RATE</small> to use when expressing <small>INCOMES</small> and <small>PRICES</small> in different countries in a common currency.</p><p>By correct value, economists mean the exchange rate that would bring <small>DEMAND</small> and <small>SUPPLY</small> of a currency into <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small> over the <small>LONG RUN</small>. The current market rate is only a short-run equilibrium. It says that goods and <small>SERVICES</small> should cost the same in all countries when measured in a common currency. It is the exchange rate that equates the price of a basket of identical traded goods and services in two countries.</p><p>PPP is often very different from the current market exchange rate. Some economists argue that once the exchange rate is pushed away from its PPP, trade and financial flows in and out of a country can move into <small>DISEQUILIBRIUM</small>, resulting in potentially substantial trade and current-account <small>DEFICITS</small> or surpluses. Because it is not just traded goods that are affected, some economists argue that PPP is too narrow a measure for judging a currency’s true value. They prefer the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER), which is the rate consistent with a country achieving an overall balance with the outside world, including both traded goods and services and <small>CAPITAL</small> flows.

The policy has been criticised for allegedly overpaying for <small>SECURITIES</small> that might not have fetched as much were central banks not buying, and for failing to stimulate the economy as much as promised, as banks tend to sit on much of the <small>MONEY</small> received for their bonds rather than lend it out.

<h2>quantity theory of money</h2>
<p>The foundation stone of <small>MONETARISM</small>. The theory says that the quantity of <small>MONEY</small> available in an economy determines the value of money. Increases in the <small>MONEY SUPPLY</small> are the main cause of <small>INFLATION</small>. This is why Milton <small>FRIEDMAN</small> claimed “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”.</p><p>The theory is built on the Fisher equation, MV = PT, named after Irving Fisher (1867–1947). M is the stock of money, V is the <small>VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION</small>, P is the <small>AVERAGE PRICE</small> and T is the number of transactions in the economy. The equation says, simply and obviously, that the quantity of money spent equals the quantity of money used. The quantity theory, in its purest form, assumes that V and T are both constant, at least in the short run. Thus any change in M leads directly to a change in P. In other words, increase the money supply and you simply cause inflation.</p><p>In the 1930s <small>KEYNES</small> challenged this theory, which was orthodoxy until then. Increases in the money supply seemed to lead to a fall in the velocity of circulation and to increases in real <small>INCOME</small>, contradicting the classical dichotomy (see <small><a href="#name.400">MONETARY NEUTRALITY</a></small>). Later, monetarists such as Friedman conceded that V could change in response to variations in M, but only in stable, predictable ways that did not challenge the thrust of the theory. Even so, monetarist policies did not perform well when they were applied in many countries during the 1980s, as even Friedman later conceded.</p>

<h2>random walk</h2>
<p>Impossible to predict the next step. The <small>EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS</small> says that the <small>PRICES</small> of many financial <small>ASSETS</small>, such as <small>SHARES</small>, follow a random walk. In other words, there is no way of knowing whether the next change in the price will be up or down, or by how much it will rise or fall. The reason is that in an efficient market, all the <small>INFORMATION</small> that would allow an investor to predict the next price move is already reflected in the current price. This belief has led some economists to argue that investors cannot consistently outperform the market. But some economists argue that asset prices are predictable (they follow a non-random walk) and that markets are not efficient.</p>

<h2>randomised controlled trial</h2>
<p>Testing a new product or idea on a small group, the results of which can be compared with those for a similar control group that has not been exposed to the new thing. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were pioneered in the 1950s in health care to test whether drugs work safely. Nowadays they are also used in many other parts of the economy, including testing schemes claiming to help alleviate <small>POVERTY</small>. Their big advantage is that they provide proof of what works, and thus can provide compelling evidence that an intervention is good value for <small>MONEY</small>.</p><p>RCTs have their limitations. They are impossible when an intervention affects everyone (for example, a change in <small>INTEREST RATES</small>) and unethical when it is known to be harmful (doctors who want to know just how unhealthy smoking is cannot ask human guinea pigs to light up). But the biggest problem with RCTs is that they are not used nearly often enough. Even doctors were slow to embrace them. Many bristled at what they saw as an aspersion cast on their professional judgment, or worried about the ethics of denying randomly selected patients a promising new treatment, or simply felt that the cost of getting evidence through an RCT was not worth the money. They were won round only when many established treatments proved to be harmful and supposedly promising new drugs proved to be useless. Now doctors regard RCTs as the gold standard of evidence. The same needs to be true in other parts of society. Without evidence of efficacy, those setting policy for, say, international development aid, schools and prisons are little better than a doctor relying on leeches and bloodletting.</p>

<h2>rate of return</h2>
<p>A way to measure economic success, albeit one that can be manipulated quite easily. It is calculated by expressing the economic gain (usually <small>PROFIT</small>) as a percentage of the <small>CAPITAL</small> used to produce it. Deciding what number to use for profit is rarely simple. Likewise, adding up how much capital was used can be tricky, especially if it is expanded to include <small>INTANGIBLE ASSETS</small> and <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>. When <small>FIRMS</small> are evaluating a project to decide whether to go ahead with it, they estimate the project’s expected rate of return and compare it with their <small>COST OF CAPITAL</small>.

<h2>ratings</h2>
<p>A guide to the riskiness of a financial instrument provided by a ratings agency, such as Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) and Fitch. These measures of <small>CREDIT</small> quality are mostly offered on marketable <small>GOVERNMENT</small> and corporate <small>DEBT</small>. A triple-A or A++ rating represents a low risk of <small>DEFAULT</small>, and a C or D rating an extreme risk of, or actual, default. Debt <small>PRICES</small> and <small>YIELDS</small> often (but not always) reflect these ratings. A triple-A bond has a low yield. High-yielding bonds, also known as junk bonds, usually have a rating that suggests a high risk of default.</p><p>A series of financial market crises from the mid-1990s onwards led to growing debate about the reliability of ratings, and whether they were slow to give warning of impending trouble. After the collapse of Enron, a US energy company, in 2001, which again the ratings agencies had failed to predict, some critics argued that the big three agencies had formed a cosy <small>OLIGOPOLY</small> and that encouraging more <small>COMPETITION</small> was the way to improve ratings. Questions were also raised about the wisdom of a system in which issuers of <small>SECURITIES</small> pay for ratings, rather than investors considering buying the securities: was not such a system fatally conflicted?</p><p>Such criticisms intensified dramatically following the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, not least because financial securities linked to <small>SUBPRIME</small> mortgages were rated far too favourably, giving investors confidence that proved to have been seriously misplaced. The <small>DODD–FRANK ACT</small> in the US required the <small>FEDERAL RESERVE</small> and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Wall Street’s main regulator, to tighten <small>REGULATION</small> of the agencies and to reduce references to ratings in their rules for <small>BANKS</small>, though neither regulator moved quickly to do so. The <small>EUROPEAN UNION</small> set up a new regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, in part to keep a closer eye on rating agencies’ conduct. In 2015, S&amp;P paid $1.4 billion to settle without admitting fault a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice, which had alleged that it was guilty of “misleading the public and defrauding investors”. Yet in 2015, business was booming again for the three leading ratings agencies, and hopes of significant new entrants to bring much-needed competition had largely been disappointed.</p>

<h2>rational expectations</h2>
<p>How some economists believe that people think about the future. Nobody can predict the future perfectly; but rational expectations theory assumes that, over time, unexpected events (<small>SHOCKS</small>) will cancel out each other and that on average people’s <small>EXPECTATIONS</small> about the future will be accurate. This is because they form their expectations rationally, using all the <small>INFORMATION</small> available to them optimally, and learn from their mistakes. This is in contrast to other theories of how people look ahead, such as <small>ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS</small>, in which people base their predictions on past trends and changes in trends, and <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small>, which assumes that expectations are somewhat irrational as a result of psychological biases.</p><p>The theory of rational expectations, for which Robert Lucas won the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small>, initially became popular with monetarists because it seemed to prove that <small>KEYNESIAN</small> policies of <small>DEMAND</small> management would fail. With rational expectations, people learn to anticipate <small>GOVERNMENT</small> policy changes and act accordingly; since macroeconomic <small>FINE TUNING</small> requires that governments be able to fool people, this implies that it is usually futile. Subsequently, this conclusion has been challenged, not least by behavioural economics. However, rational and near-rational expectations have remained part of the mainstream of economic thought.</p>

<h2>real options theory</h2>
<p>A newish theory of how to take <small>INVESTMENT</small> decisions when the future is uncertain, which draws parallels between the real economy and the use and valuation of financial options. It is becoming increasingly fashionable at business schools and even in the boardroom.</p><p>Traditional investment theory says that when a firm evaluates a proposed project, it should calculate the project’s <small>NET PRESENT VALUE</small> (NPV) and if it is positive, go ahead. Real options theory assumes that <small>FIRMS</small> also have some choice in when to invest. In other words, the project is like an option: there is an opportunity, but not an obligation, to go ahead with it. As with financial options, the interesting question is when to exercise the option: certainly not when it is out of the money (the cost of investing exceeds the benefit). Financial options should not necessarily be exercised as soon as they are in the money (the benefit from exercising exceeds the cost). It may be better to wait until they are deep in the money (the benefit is far above the cost). Likewise, companies should not necessarily invest as soon as a project has a positive NPV. It may pay to wait.</p><p>Most firms’ investment opportunities have embedded in them many managerial options. For example, an <small>OIL</small> company’s bosses think they have discovered an oil field, but they are uncertain about how much oil it contains and what the price of oil will be once they start to pump. Option one: to buy or lease the <small>LAND</small> and explore. Option two: if they find oil, to start to pump. Whether to exercise these options will depend on the oil price and what it is likely to do in future. Because oil prices are highly volatile, it might not make sense to go ahead with production until the oil price is far above the price at which traditional investment theory would say that the NPV is positive and give the investment the green light.</p><p>Options on real <small>ASSETS</small> behave rather like financial options (a <small>SHARE</small> option, say). The similarities are such that they can, at least in theory, be valued according to the same methodology. In the case of the oil company, for instance, the cost of land corresponds to the down payment on a call (right to buy) option, and the extra investment needed to start production to its strike price (the money that must be paid if the option is exercised). As with financial options, the longer the option lasts before it expires and the more volatile is the price of the underlying asset (in this case, oil), the more the option is worth. That is the theory. In practice, pricing financial options is often tricky, and valuing real options is harder still.</p>

A region’s problems should be somewhat self-correcting. After all, simple theories of <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small> would suggest that firms will move to areas of low <small>WAGES</small> and high <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> to take advantage of cheaper labour and surplus workers, or that workers will move away from such areas to where more and better-paid jobs exist. But some economic theories suggest that rather than moving to areas where wages are lowest, firms often <small>CLUSTER</small> together with other successful businesses. Regional policy may need to be extremely generous to tempt firms to give up the advantages of being in a cluster.</p>

Some regulation has been motivated by politics rather than <small>ECONOMICS</small>, for instance, restrictions on the number of hours people can work or the circumstances in which an employer can dismiss employees.</p><p>Even when introduced for sound economic reasons, regulation can generate more costs than benefits. Regulated firms or individuals may face substantial compliance costs. Firms may devote substantial resources to <small>REGULATORY ARBITRAGE</small>, which would leave consumers no better off. Regulation may lead to <small>MORAL HAZARD</small> if people believe that the government is keeping an eye on the behaviour of the regulated business and so do less monitoring of their own. Regulation may be badly designed and thus lock an industry into an inefficient <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>. Rigid regulation may hold back <small>INNOVATION</small>. There is also the danger of <small>REGULATORY CAPTURE</small>. In short, then, <small>REGULATORY FAILURE</small> may be even worse for an economy than market failure.</p><p>The <small>CRASH</small> of 2008 and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that followed reinvigorated the debate about the relative severity of market failure and regulatory failure, both prevalent at the time.</p>

<h2>rent</h2>
<p>Confusingly, rent has two different meanings for economists. The first is the commonplace definition: the <small>INCOME</small> from hiring out <small>LAND</small> or other durable goods. The second, also known as economic rent, is a measure of <small>MARKET POWER</small>: the difference between what a <small>FACTOR OF PRODUCTION</small> is paid and how much it would need to be paid to remain in its current use. A soccer star may be paid $50,000 a week to play for his team when he would be willing to turn out for only $10,000, so his economic rent is $40,000 a week. In <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small> there are no economic rents, as new <small>FIRMS</small> enter a market and compete until <small>PRICES</small> fall and all rent is eliminated. Reducing rent does not change production decisions, so economic rent can be taxed without any adverse impact on the real economy, assuming that it really is rent.</p>

Many of these are not unique to the asset you own but reflect broader possibilities, such as that the stockmarket average will rise or fall, that <small>INTEREST RATES</small> will be cut or increased, or that the <small>GROWTH</small> rate will change in an entire economy or industry. Residual risk, also known as alpha, is what is left after you take out all the other shared risk exposures. Exposure to this risk can be reduced by <small>DIVERSIFICATION</small>. Contrast with <small>SYSTEMATIC RISK</small>.</p>

<h2>revealed preference</h2>
<p>An example of a popular joke among economists: two economists see a Ferrari. “I want one of those,” says the first. “Obviously not,” replies the other. To get a smile out of this it is necessary (but not, alas, sufficient) to know about revealed preference. This is the notion that what you want is revealed by what you do, not by what you say. Actions speak louder than words. If the economist had really wanted a Ferrari he would have tried to buy one, if he did not own one already.</p><p>Economists have three main approaches to modelling <small>DEMAND</small> and how it will change if <small>PRICES</small> or <small>INCOMES</small> change:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">The cardinal approach involves asking consumers to say how much <small>UTILITY</small> they get from consuming a particular good, aggregating this across all goods and <small>SERVICES</small>, and calculating how demand would change on the assumption that people will consume the combination of things that maximises their total utility.</span></li><li><span class="black1">The ordinal approach does not require consumers to say how much utility they get in absolute terms from consuming a particular good. Instead, it asks them to indicate the relative utility they get from consuming one item compared with another – that is, to say if they prefer one basket of goods to another, or are indifferent between them.</span></li><li><span class="black1">The third approach is revealed preference. To model demand it is only necessary to be able to compare an individual’s <small>CONSUMPTION</small> decisions in situations with different prices and/or incomes and to assume that consumers are consistent in their decisions over time (that is, if they prefer wine to beer in one period they will still prefer wine in the next).</span></li></ul><p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<h2>Ricardian equivalence</h2>
<p>The controversial idea, suggested by David <small>RICARDO</small>, that <small>GOVERNMENT DEFICITS</small> do not affect the overall <small>DEMAND</small> in an economy. This is because taxpayers know that any deficit has to be repaid later, and so increase their <small>SAVINGS</small> in anticipation of a tax bill. Thus government attempts to stimulate an economy by increasing <small>PUBLIC SPENDING</small> and/or cutting taxes will be rendered impotent by the private-sector reaction.</p>

<h2>Ricardo, David</h2>
<p>The third of 17 children of a wealthy banker, David Ricardo (1772–1823) was disinherited at the age of 21 after he married a Quaker against the wishes of his parents. He became a stockbroker and did so well that he retired at 42 to concentrate on writing and politics.</p><p>A friend of fellow classical economists Thomas Malthus and Jean-Baptiste Say (see <small><a href="#name.582">SAY’S LAW</a></small>), he developed many economic theories that are still in use today. The most influential was <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small>, the theory underpinning the case for <small>FREE TRADE</small>. In his 1817 book, <i>The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,</i> he outlined a theory of distribution of <small>OUTPUT</small> in an economy. In this he argued that the allocation of <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small> to any area of economic activity is determined by the amount of economic <small>RENT</small> that can be earned from it. As this gradually falls because of <small>DIMINISHING RETURNS, CAPITAL</small> and other resources shift to more profitable projects. He examined the split between <small>WAGES</small> and <small>PROFIT</small>, arguing that “there can be no rise in the value of <small>LABOUR</small> without a fall of profits”. He also claimed that changes in the <small>GOVERNMENT DEFICIT</small> did not affect the level of <small>DEMAND</small> in the economy (<small>RICARDIAN EQUIVALENCE</small>).</p>

<h2>risk</h2>
<p>The chance of things not turning out as expected. Risk-taking lies at the heart of <small>CAPITALISM</small> and is responsible for a large part of the <small>GROWTH</small> of an economy. In general, economists assume that people are willing to be exposed to increased risks only if, on average, they can expect to earn higher returns than if they had less exposure to risk. How much higher these <small>EXPECTED RETURNS</small> need to be depends partly on the probability of an undesirable outcome and partly on whether the risk taker is <small>RISK-AVERSE, RISK-NEUTRAL</small> or <small>RISK-SEEKING</small>.</p><p>During the second half of the 20th century, economists greatly improved their understanding of risk and developed theories of <small>RISK MANAGEMENT</small>, which suggest when it makes sense to use <small>INSURANCE, DIVERSIFICATION</small> or <small>HEDGING</small> to change risk exposures.</p><p>In <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> the most commonly used measure of risk is the <small>VOLATILITY</small> (or <small>STANDARD DEVIATION</small>) of the <small>PRICE</small> of, or more appropriately the <small>TOTAL RETURNS</small> on, an <small>ASSET</small>. Often added to the risk profile are other statistical measures such as skewness and the possibility of extreme changes on rare occasions. (See <small><a href="#name.641">STRESS TEST</a>, <a href="#name.585">SCENARIO ANALYSIS</a></small> and <small><a href="#name.705">VALUE AT RISK</a></small>.) The limitations of these measures of risk were highlighted by the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008.</p>

<h2>risk management</h2>
<p>The process of bearing the <small>RISK</small> you want to bear, and minimising your exposure to the risk you do not want. This can be done in several ways: not doing things that carry a particular risk; <small>HEDGING; DIVERSIFICATION</small>; and buying <small>INSURANCE</small>.</p>

<p>Someone who thinks that <small>RISK</small> is a four-letter word. Risk-averse investors are those who, when faced with two <small>INVESTMENTS</small> with the same <small>EXPECTED RETURN</small> but two different risks, prefer the one with the lower risk.</p>

<a name='name.575'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>risk-free rate</h2>
<p>The <small>RATE OF RETURN</small> earned on a <small>RISK</small>-free <small>ASSET</small>. This is a crucial component of <small>MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY</small>, which assumes the existence of both risky and risk-free assets. The risk-free asset is usually assumed to be a <small>GOVERNMENT BOND</small>, and the risk-free rate is the <small>YIELD</small> on that bond, although in fact even a <small>TREASURY BILL</small> is not entirely without risk. In modern portfolio theory, the risk-free rate is lower than the <small>EXPECTED RETURN</small> on the risky asset, because the issuer of the risky asset has to offer risk-averse investors the expectation of higher <small>RETURNS</small> to persuade them to forgo the risk-free asset.</p>

<h2>satisficing</h2>
<p>Settling for what is good enough, rather than the best that is possible. This may occur in any situation in which decision-makers are trying to pursue more than one goal at a time. <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> and <small>NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> assume that individuals, <small>FIRMS</small> and <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> try to achieve the <small>OPTIMUM</small>, best possible outcome from their decisions. Satisficing assumes they decide for each goal a level of achievement that would be good enough and try to find a way to achieve all of these sub-optimal goals at once. This approach to decision-making is common in <small>BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS</small>. It can be regarded as a realist’s theory of how decisions are taken. The concept was invented by Herbert Simon (1916–2001), a Nobel Prize-winning economist, in his book, <i>Models of Man,</i> in 1957.</p>

<h2>savings</h2>
<p>Any <small>INCOME</small> that is not spent. Ultimately, savings are the source of <small>INVESTMENT</small> in an economy, although domestic savings may be supplemented by <small>CAPITAL</small> from foreign savers or themselves be invested abroad.</p><p>In an economic sense, savings include purchases of <small>SHARES</small> or other financial <small>SECURITIES</small>. However, many official measures of a country’s savings ratio – total savings expressed as a percentage of total income – leave out such financial transactions. At times when the <small>DEMAND</small> for financial securities is unusually high, this can give a misleading impression of how much saving is taking place.</p><p>How much individuals save varies significantly among different age groups (see <small><a href="#name.361">LIFE-CYCLE HYPOTHESIS</a></small>) and nationalities. Everywhere, people of all ages save more as their <small>INCOME</small> rises. The supply of savings rises when <small>INTEREST RATES</small> rise; a rise in interest rates causes demand for funds to invest to fall; a rise in demand for investment funds may cause interest rates, and thus the <small>COST OF CAPITAL</small>, to rise. The amount of savings is also influenced by changes in wealth (see <small><a href="#name.717">WEALTH EFFECT</a></small>) and by <small>TAXATION</small> policies.</p>

<h2>scalability</h2>
<p>The ease with which the <small>SUPPLY</small> of an economic product or process can be expanded to meet increased <small>DEMAND</small>. Recent technological advances have led some economists to talk about the growing importance of instant scalability. For example, once a piece of software has been written it can be made available in an instant over the internet to unlimited numbers of users for almost no cost. This potentially allows a new product to enter and win market share far more quickly than ever before, intensifying <small>COMPETITION</small> and perhaps accelerating the process of creative destruction (see <small><a href="#name.586">SCHUMPETER</a></small>).</p>

<h2>Schumpeter, Joseph</h2>
<p>After growing up in the Austro-Hungarian empire, in which he worked as an itinerant lawyer, Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) became an academic in 1909. He was appointed Austrian minister of finance in 1919, presiding over a period of <small>HYPERINFLATION</small>. He then became president of a small Viennese <small>BANK</small>, which collapsed. He returned to academia in Bonn in 1925 and in the 1930s joined the faculty of Harvard.</p><p>In 1911, while teaching at Czernowitz (now in Ukraine), he wrote the <i>Theory of Economic Development.</i> In this he set out his theory of entrepreneurship, in which <small>GROWTH</small> occurred, usually in spurts, because <small>COMPETITION</small> and declining <small>PROFIT</small> inspired <small>ENTREPRENEURS</small> to innovate. This developed into a theory of the trade cycle (see <small><a href="#name.059">BUSINESS CYCLE</a></small>) and into a notion of dynamic competition characterised by his phrase “creative destruction”. In <small>CAPITALISM</small>, he argued, there is a tendency for <small>FIRMS</small> to acquire a degree of <small>MONOPOLY</small> power. At this point, competition no longer takes place through the <small>PRICE MECHANISM</small> but instead through <small>INNOVATION</small>. Perhaps because monopolies often become lazy, successful innovation may come from new entrants to a market which take it away from the incumbent, thus blowing “gales of creative destruction” through the economy. Eventually, the new entrants grow fat on their monopoly <small>PROFITS</small>, until the next gale of creative destruction blows them away.</p><p>Ever controversial, and often wrong, in his 1942 book <i>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,</i> he predicted the downfall of capitalism at the hands of an intellectual elite. Time may yet prove him right.</p>

<h2>second-best theory</h2>
<p>As we do not live in a perfect world, how useful are economic theories based on the assumption that we do? Second-best theory, set out in 1956 by Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster, looks at what happens when the assumptions of an economic model are not fully met. They found that in situations where not all the conditions are met, the second-best situation – that is, meeting as many of the other conditions as possible – may not result in the <small>OPTIMUM</small> solution. Indeed, reckoned Lipsey and Lancaster, in general, when one optimal <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small> condition is not satisfied all the other equilibrium conditions will change.</p><p>Potentially, the second-best equilibrium may be worse than a new equilibrium brought about by <small>GOVERNMENT</small> intervention, either to restore equilibrium to the market that is in <small>DISEQUILIBRIUM</small>, or to move the other markets away from their second-best conditions.</p><p>Economists have seized on this insight to justify all sorts of interventions in the economy, ranging from taxing certain goods and subsidising others to restricting <small>FREE TRADE</small>. Whenever there is <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>, second-best theory says it is always possible to design a government policy that would increase economic <small>WELFARE</small>. Alas, the history of government intervention suggests that although the second-best may be improved on in theory, in practice second-best is often least worst.</p>

<h2>secular stagnation</h2>
<p>When an economy becomes stuck on a permanently low <small>GROWTH</small> trajectory or one with no growth at all. The term was first used to describe the US economy during the Great <small>DEPRESSION</small>. The idea that the US in particular, and perhaps some other industrialised countries too, were again stuck in secular stagnation was proposed in 2013 by Larry Summers, a former US Treasury secretary. The term secular is used in contrast to cyclical to refer to long-lasting forces that are holding back economic <small>GROWTH</small>. Summers blamed insufficient <small>DEMAND</small> and underinvestment in <small>INFRASTRUCTURE</small>. Critics of the secular-stagnation hypothesis argue that slow growth since the <small>CRASH</small> is largely cyclical, or the result of special factors such as the overhang of <small>DEBT</small> that will eventually matter less, and that growth will accelerate again.</p>

<h2>securitisation</h2>
<p>Turning an expected future cash flow into tradeable, <small>BOND</small>-like <small>SECURITIES</small>. Creating such <small>ASSET</small>-backed securities became a lucrative business for financial firms during the 1990s, as they invented new securities based on cash flow ranging from future mortgage and credit-card payments to bank loans, movie revenue and even the royalties on songs by David Bowie (so-called Bowie-bonds).</p><p>Securitisation has many benefits, at least in theory. Issuers gain instant access to <small>MONEY</small> for which they would otherwise have to wait months or years, and they can shed some of the <small>RISK</small> that their expected revenue will not materialise. By selling securitised loans (known as collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs), banks are able to finance their customers without tying up large amounts of <small>CAPITAL</small>. Investors can hold a new sort of asset, (supposedly) less risky than unsecured bonds, giving them the risk-reducing benefit of <small>DIVERSIFICATION</small>. But there are dangers. The future cash flow underlying the securities may flow earlier or later than promised, or not at all.</p><p>This downside became all too clear around and during the financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, when many securitised assets performed far worse than their <small>RATINGS</small> suggested they would, resulting in massive losses that paralysed the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>. The first asset-backed securities to go badly wrong were tied to <small>SUBPRIME</small> mortgages on millions of US homes. After plunging initially, securitisation volumes have since increased again. But it remains to be seen if securitisation will ever again be as popular as it was during the gung-ho years before the crash.</p>

<h2>shadow banking</h2>
<p>The highly interconnected network of investment <small>BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS</small>, mortgage originators and the like that played a significant part in causing the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, the <small>BUBBLE</small> that preceded it and the <small>GREAT RECESSION</small> that came after.

Yet the importance of shadow banks to the financial system was so great that it was widely believed that the biggest of them, at least, would never be allowed to fail by <small>GOVERNMENT</small>, thus creating a <small>MORAL HAZARD</small> that led them to take on excessive risk, with ultimately disastrous consequences. As their role in the economic crisis became clear, moves were made to subject shadow banks to more stringent regulation, typically by bringing them out of the shadows and into the mainstream of the regulated system. One consequence of this has been to push risk out of the regulated financial system and into a new shadow-banking system, which may again be building up unsustainably large risks that will come back to haunt the mainstream financial system sooner or later.</p>

<h2>sharing economy</h2>
<p>A peer-to-peer system of allocating access to goods and <small>SERVICES</small>, made popular by the rise of internet-based platform companies such as Airbnb and Uber. The “sharing” part refers to the fact that many people in a sharing economy temporarily use <small>ASSETS</small> owned by others (cars, homes) instead of owning the assets themselves. Is this really sharing, rather than just dressing up traditional renting in new language? Maybe not. But technology has certainly reduced <small>TRANSACTION COSTS</small>, making sharing or renting assets cheaper and easier than ever – and therefore possible on a much larger scale.</p><p>A crucial change has been the availability of more <small>BIG DATA</small> about people and things, which allows physical assets to be digitally disaggregated and consumed as services. Before the internet, renting a surfboard, a power tool or a parking space from someone else was feasible, but was usually more trouble than it was worth. Now the likes of Airbnb and Uber can match up owners and renters in an instant at little marginal cost; social networks provide a way to check up on people you are sharing with and build trust; and online payment systems handle the billing.</p><p>Advocates of the sharing economy argue that it can reduce waste by enabling the assets being shared to be used more efficiently than they were previously. Critics say that it is a way of destroying what had been long-term jobs in the old unsharing economy, replacing them with lower-paid work without healthcare and other benefits or much job security.</p>

<h2>Sharpe ratio</h2>
<p>A rough guide to whether the rewards from an <small>INVESTMENT</small> justify the <small>RISK</small>, invented by Bill Sharpe, a winner of the <small>NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS</small> and co-creator of the <small>CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL</small>. You simply divide the past <small>RETURN</small> on the investment (less the <small>RISK-FREE RATE</small>) by its <small>STANDARD DEVIATION</small>, the simplest measure of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio the better, that is, the greater is the return per unit of risk. However, as it is a backward-looking measure, based on what an investment has done in the past, the Sharpe ratio does not guarantee similar performance in future.</p>

<h2>shorting</h2>
<p>Selling a security, such as a <small>SHARE</small>, that you do not currently own, in the expectation that its <small>PRICE</small> will fall by the time the security has to be delivered to its new owner. If the price does fall, you can buy the security at the lower price, deliver it to whoever you sold it to and make a <small>PROFIT</small>. The <small>RISK</small> is that the price rises, leaving you with a loss. Sometimes an investor will borrow a security in order to short it. When an investor sells a security without such borrowing, it is called naked shorting.</p><p>Shorting can be controversial, and naked shorting more so. In the months before financial <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, <small>BANKS</small> accused short sellers of making matters worse by shorting their shares. Some <small>HEDGE FUNDS</small>, such as that run by John Paulson, ultimately made billions from their shorting when Lehman Brothers failed and shares in other banks plunged. For a while, regulators in leading economies banned the shorting of shares of some financial <small>FIRMS</small>. Critics of this ban argued that shorting provides <small>LIQUIDITY</small> to the market, and banning it made matters worse by reducing liquidity at a time when the <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> made it especially valuable.</p>

<h2>short-termism</h2>
<p>Doing things that make you better off in the short run but worse off in the <small>LONG RUN</small>. After the bursting of the stockmarket <small>BUBBLE</small> at the start of the 2000s, and again after the <small>CRASH</small> of 2008, accusations of short-termism were made against the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>-based <small>CAPITALISM</small> of the US and the UK. Investors, it was claimed, had become too focused on short-term <small>PROFITS</small> and changes in <small>SHARE PRICES</small>, and failed to probe deeply enough into long-term performance. As a result, managers did things that made their profits look as good as possible in the short run, often to the detriment of their company’s long-term health. How managers were paid often exacerbated this tendency, resulting in massive <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> in the long run for investors, as many <small>FIRMS</small> engaged in misleading and even fraudulent accounting practices to inflate short-term profits, as well as taking excessive <small>RISKS</small>. In the 1980s and early 1990s, there were also complaints about short-termism, albeit in a somewhat different and arguably less convincing form, namely that it caused lower <small>INVESTMENT</small> by businesses than in countries where the stockmarket was less important, such as Germany and Japan.</p><p>How to reduce short-termism is unclear, especially given <small>KEYNES’S</small> observation about the lack of appeal of the long run. However, focusing on how managers and institutional investors are compensated, to minimise the incentives for short-termist behaviour, offers plenty of potential.</p>

<h2>signalling</h2>
<p>A solution to one of the biggest sources of <small>MARKET FAILURE</small>: <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small>. Often the biggest problem facing sellers is how to convince buyers that what they are selling is as good as they say it is. This problem arises in situations where the qualities of the thing being sold cannot be observed easily by buyers, who thus fear that sellers may be conning them. In such situations, an answer may be for sellers to do something that shows they mean what they say about quality. This something is what economists call signalling.</p><p>Going to a leading university might be worth far more for what it signals to prospective employers about your abilities than for what you learn as a student. Likewise, the fact that a firm is willing to spend a lot of <small>MONEY ADVERTISING</small> its product may say far more about what it thinks of the product than any <small>INFORMATION</small> included in the advert. To be useful, signals must impose more costs on those who use them to send false messages than any gains they may make from lying.</p>

Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Adam Smith (1723–90) was educated at Glasgow and Oxford, and in 1751 became professor of logic at Glasgow University. Eight years later he made his name by publishing the <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments.</i> His 1776 book, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,</i> is the bible of <small>CLASSICAL ECONOMICS</small> – though it should be read in conjunction with his <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments.</i> He emphasised the role of specialisation (the <small>DIVISION OF LABOUR</small>), <small>TECHNICAL PROGRESS</small> and <small>CAPITAL INVESTMENT</small> as the main engines of economic <small>GROWTH</small>. Above all, he stressed the importance of the <small>INVISIBLE HAND</small>, the way in which self-interest pursued in free markets leads to the most efficient use of economic resources and makes everybody better off in the process.</p>

<h2>social capital</h2>
<p>The amount of community spirit or trust that an economy has gluing it together. The more social capital there is, the more productive the economy will be. Yet, curiously, one of the best-known books to address the role of social capital, <i>Bowling Alone,</i> by Robert Putnam of Harvard University, pointed out that Americans were far less likely to be members of community organisations, clubs or associations in the 1990s than they were in the 1950s. He illustrated his thesis by charting the decline of bowling leagues. Yet the US economy has gone from strength to strength. This has led some economists to question whether social capital is really as important as the theory suggests, and others to argue that membership of bowling leagues and other community organisations is simply not a good indicator of the amount of social capital in a country.</p>

In recent years, the number of social entrepreneurs has soared, both within the non-<small>PROFIT/NGO</small> sector and increasingly within mission-driven for-profit businesses, such as <small>MICROFINANCE FIRMS</small> and <small>B CORPS</small>. Some economists believe that social entrepreneurs are increasing the <small>EFFICIENCY</small> and <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> of the social sector, which has often been inefficient because of the lack of entrepreneurship in <small>GOVERNMENT</small> and the established NGO sector.

<h2>social network analysis</h2>
<p>This has become one of the fastest-growing areas of economic research. It has its origins in early 20th-century sociology and the work of Emile Durkheim, but it has moved into mainstream <small>ECONOMICS</small> as research has addressed important questions about how and why people form and maintain networks, and how being a member of a given network can increase or reduce a person’s <small>HUMAN CAPITAL</small>. The emergence of vast online social networks such as Facebook has generated lots of new data that economists are using to address such questions. One that has received considerable attention is the theory of Dunbar’s number. Devised by Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist, this says that people are capable of maintaining a stable network of only a fixed, relatively low number of other people. The Dunbar number is usually reckoned to be 150, though it can be as low as 100 or as high as 250. Economists studying the vast friend networks built up on Facebook may disagree.</p>

<h2>Social Progress Index</h2>
<p>A non-financial index that measures how well a geographical entity such as a country or city provides for the social and environmental needs of its people. Cofounded by the author of this book, and first published in 2013, the Social Progress Index (SPI) aims to give a more accurate sense of how the entity is doing than is possible using a solely financial measure, such as <small>GDP</small> per head, or a hybrid indicator, such as the <small>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX</small>.</p><p>The SPI has three main pillars, each comprising four sub-indicators: basic human needs (clean water, shelter, etc); foundations of well-being (access to information, sustainable ecosystem, etc); and opportunity (personal rights, access to higher education, etc). Not only does this make possible a much more detailed and nuanced understanding of the state of development in a particular location, but it also allows places to be compared on how effectively they use their income to deliver benefits to their people. This is done by looking at the correlation of SPI and GDP for each entity to reveal which places outperform in the social progress they deliver relative to their GDP and which underperform. For instance, in 2015 the US ranked sixth in the world on GDP per head but only 16th on SPI, an underperformer, whereas Costa Rica ranked 26th on SPI, outperforming its GDP per head ranking of 59th. Understanding why some countries outperform on the <small>SPI</small> relative to their GDP and others underperform should lead to better economic policymaking.</p>

<h2>social-impact bond</h2>
<p>A recent innovation in financing different approaches to solving society’s problems; also known as a “pay for success” contract. The idea is to attract private <small>CAPITAL</small> to solve a deep-rooted problem that is soaking up public <small>MONEY</small>, such as reoffending by released prisoners, which costs governments millions of dollars a year. A social-impact bond could raise money to pay for the expansion of organisations with the expertise to reduce reoffending rates. The more money the organisations save the government, the higher the return the bond would pay investors. This goes beyond a standard <small>PUBLIC-PRIVATE</small> partnership, which is expected to provide the same service as the state but more cheaply. A social-impact bond rewards better social outcomes and does not merely cut costs.</p><p>The world’s first social-impact bond was launched in the UK in 2010, with the aim of reducing prisoner-reoffending rates in Peterborough. Early results showed that reoffending fell by 8.4% compared with a control group in a <small>RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL</small>. Since then social-impact bonds have been launched in other countries, including the US, Australia and Israel. They have had various goals, ranging from tackling obesity to improving early childhood development.</p><p>Economists remain divided over how big an idea this emphasis on paying for performance will prove to be. Critics think that at most it will provide seed financing for small experiments, which if successful will be expanded through traditional government spending. Supporters think it could significantly increase the funding of social innovation, bringing substantial benefits to society. Hopefully it will be the latter.</p>

<h2>sticky prices</h2>
<p>Petrol-pump <small>PRICES</small> do not change every time the <small>OIL</small> price changes, and holiday prices and standard hotel rates are fixed for months. Sticky prices are slow to change in response to changes in <small>SUPPLY</small> or <small>DEMAND</small>. As a result there is, at least temporarily, <small>DISEQUILIBRIUM</small> in the market. The causes of stickiness include <small>MENU COSTS, INADEQUATE</small> information, consumers’ dislike of frequent price changes and long-term contracts with fixed prices. Prices change only when the cost of leaving them unchanged exceeds the expense of adjusting them. In <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small>, prices move all the time because the cost of quoting the wrong price can be huge. In other industries, the penalty may be much less severe. Small disequilibria in, say, the pricing of hotel rooms will not make much difference. So hotel prices are often sticky.</p>

Such borrowers were known to be riskier than prime borrowers, and so subprime debt was lent at higher interest rates than prime debt and, when securitised into <small>CDOS</small>, typically traded in the <small>FINANCIAL MARKETS</small> at a higher <small>YIELD</small> than <small>INVESTMENT</small>-grade <small>SECURITIES</small>. In practice, subprime debt turned out to be far riskier than most people had thought. Initially heralded as a much-needed extension of credit to poorer people who had previously been denied access to mainstream finance, subprime came to be shorthand for a black hole at the heart of the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small>.</p>

<h2>supply</h2>
<p>One of the two words economists use most; the other is <small>DEMAND</small>. These are the twin driving forces of the market economy. Supply is the amount of a good or service available at any particular <small>PRICE</small>. The law of supply is that, other things remaining the same, the quantity supplied will increase as the price increases. The actual amount supplied will be determined, ultimately, by what the market price is, which depends on the amount demanded as well as what suppliers are willing to produce. What suppliers are willing to supply depends on several things:</p><ul><li><span class="black1">the cost of the <small>FACTORS OF PRODUCTION</small>;</span></li><li><span class="black1">technology;</span></li><li><span class="black1">the price of other goods and <small>SERVICES</small> (which, if high enough, might tempt the supplier to switch production to those products);</span></li><li><span class="black1">the ability of the supplier accurately to forecast demand and plan production to make the most of the opportunity.</span></li></ul><p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<h2>supply-side policies</h2>
<p>Increasing economic growth by making markets work more efficiently. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher championed supply-side policies as they attacked <small>KEYNESIAN DEMAND</small> management. Pumping up demand without making markets work better would simply lead to higher <small>INFLATION</small>; economic <small>GROWTH</small> would increase only when markets were able to operate more freely. Thus they pursued policies of <small>DEREGULATION, LIBERALISATION</small> and <small>PRIVATISATION</small> and encouraged <small>FREE TRADE</small>. To reduce <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>, they tried to increase the <small>EFFICIENCY</small> of the jobs market by cutting the rate of <small>INCOME TAX</small> and attacking legal and other impediments to <small>LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY</small>. The results of these programmes are much debated. In particular, the belief, apparently supported by the <small>LAFFER CURVE</small>, that cutting tax rates would increase tax revenue did not always stand up well to real-world testing. Even so, it is now recognised that supply-side reforms are a crucial element in an effective economic policy.</p>

<h2>systemic risk</h2>
<p>The <small>RISK</small> of damage being done to the health of the <small>FINANCIAL SYSTEM</small> as a whole. A constant concern of <small>BANK</small> regulators is that the collapse of a single bank could bring down the entire financial system. This is why regulators often organise a rescue when a bank gets into financial difficulties. However, the expectation of such a rescue may create a <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>, encouraging banks to behave in ways that increase systemic risk. Another concern of regulators is that the <small>RISK-MANAGEMENT</small> methods used by banks are so similar that they may increase systemic risk by creating a tendency for <small>CROWD</small> behaviour. In particular, problems in one market may cause banks in general to liquidate positions in other markets, causing a vicious cycle of <small>LIQUIDITY</small> being withdrawn from the financial system as everybody rushes for the emergency exit at once.</p><p>In 2008, US financial regulators were confronted with the greatest systemic risk since at least the 1930s, as the <small>CREDIT CRUNCH</small> that began the previous year pushed leading financial institutions to the brink of <small>BANKRUPTCY</small>. Regulators intervened to prevent the bankruptcy first of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, and then two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, in September, they decided to allow another big investment bank, Lehman Brothers, to file for bankruptcy, apparently judging that its failure did not pose a systemic risk. Within days that judgment was to prove catastrophically wrong, prompting a massive bail-out of the global financial system that cost many times more than it would have done to prevent Lehman Brothers from going bust. A key part of the <small>DODD–FRANK ACT</small> introduced in the US in 2010 was to identify systemically important financial institutions that were deemed <small>TOO BIG TO FAIL</small> and regulate them far more tightly.</p>

As a result, a country with a comparatively high tax rate may not have a high <small>TAX BURDEN</small> if it has a more narrowly defined tax base than other countries.

<h2>tax competition</h2>
<p>Low-tax policies pursued by some countries in the hope of attracting international businesses and <small>CAPITAL</small>. Economists usually favour <small>COMPETITION</small> in any form. But some say that tax competition is often a beggar-thy-neighbour policy, which can reduce another country’s <small>TAX BASE</small>, or force it to change its mix of taxes, or stop it taxing in the way it would like.</p><p>Economists who favour tax competition often cite a 1956 article by Charles Tiebout (1924–68) entitled “A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures”. In it he argued that, faced with a choice of different combinations of tax and <small>GOVERNMENT SERVICES</small>, taxpayers will choose to locate where they get closest to the mixture they want. Variations in tax rates among different countries are good, because they give taxpayers more choice and thus more chance of being satisfied. This also puts pressure on governments to be efficient. Thus measures to harmonise taxes are a bad idea.</p><p>There is at least one big caveat to this theory. Tiebout assumed, crucially, that taxpayers are highly mobile and able to move to wherever their preferred combination of taxes and benefits is on offer. But many taxpayers, including the great majority of workers, are not able to move easily. Tax competition may make it harder to redistribute from rich to poor through the tax system by allowing the rich to move to where taxes are not redistributive.</p><p>Following worldwide outrage in 2012 over the tax practices of global <small>FIRMS</small> such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Starbucks, the <small>OECD</small> introduced measures designed to reduce the negative consequences of “harmful” tax competition. These firms were found to pay virtually no tax in the UK, despite running substantial operations in the country. They had taken account of entertainingly named tax-minimisation strategies such as the “double Irish Dutch sandwich”. It remains to be seen if sufficient co-operation between countries will be forthcoming to put a stop to harmful tax competition.</p>

<h2>taxation</h2>
<p>Prostitution may be the oldest profession, but tax collection was surely not far behind. In its early days, <small>TAXATION</small> did not always involve handing over money. The ancient Chinese paid with pressed tea, and Jivara tribesmen in Brazil stumped up shrunken heads. As the <small>PRICE</small> of their citizenship, ancient Greeks and Romans could be called on to serve as soldiers and had to supply their own weapons. The origins of modern taxation can be traced to wealthy subjects paying money to their king in lieu of military service.</p><p>The other early source of tax revenue was trade, with tolls and customs duties being collected from travelling merchants. The big advantage of these taxes was that they fell mostly on visitors rather than residents.</p><p><small>INCOME TAX</small>, the biggest source of <small>GOVERNMENT</small> funds today in most countries, is a comparatively recent invention, probably because the notion of annual <small>INCOME</small> is itself a modern concept. Governments preferred to tax things that were easy to measure and on which it was thus easy to calculate the liability. This is why early taxes concentrated on tangible items such as <small>LAND</small> and property, physical goods, commodities and ships, as well as things such as the number of windows or fireplaces in a building.</p><p>In the 20th century, particularly the second half, governments around the world took a growing share of their country’s <small>NATIONAL INCOME</small> in tax, mainly to pay for increasingly expensive defence efforts and for a modern <small>WELFARE</small> state. <small>INDIRECT TAXATION</small> on <small>CONSUMPTION</small>, such as <small>VALUE-ADDED</small> tax, has become increasingly important as <small>DIRECT TAXATION</small> on income and wealth has become increasingly unpopular.</p><p>But big differences among countries remain. One is the overall level of tax. For example, in the US tax revenue amounts to around one-third of its <small>GDP</small>, whereas in Sweden it is closer to half. Others are the preferred methods of collecting it (direct versus indirect), the rates at which it is levied and the definition of the <small>TAX BASE</small> to which these rates are applied. Countries have different attitudes to <small>PROGRESSIVE TAXATION</small> and <small>REGRESSIVE TAXATION</small>. There are also big differences in the way responsibility for taxation is divided among different levels of government.</p><p>Arguably, any tax is a bad tax. But <small>PUBLIC GOODS</small> and other government activities have to be paid for somehow, and economists often have strong views on which methods of taxation are more or less efficient. Most economists agree that the best tax is one that has as little impact as possible on people’s decisions about whether to undertake a productive economic activity. High rates of tax on labour may discourage people from working, and so result in lower tax revenue than there would be if the tax rate were lower, an idea captured in the <small>LAFFER CURVE</small>. Certainly, the <small>MARGINAL</small> rate of tax may have a bigger effect on incentives than the overall <small>TAX BURDEN</small>.</p><p><small>LAND TAX</small> is regarded as the most efficient by some economists and tax on expenditure by others, as it does all the taking after the wealth creation is done. Some economists favour a neutral tax system that does not influence the sorts of economic activities that take place. Others favour using tax, and tax breaks, to guide economic activity in ways they favour, such as to minimise pollution and to increase the attractiveness of employing people rather than <small>CAPITAL</small>.</p><p>Some economists argue that the tax system should be characterised by both <small>HORIZONTAL EQUITY</small> and <small>VERTICAL EQUITY</small>, because this is fair, and because when the tax system is fair people may find it harder to justify <small>TAX AVOIDANCE</small> and <small>TAX EVASION</small>. However, who ultimately pays (the <small>TAX INCIDENCE</small>) may be different from who is initially charged, if that person or company can pass it on, say by adding the tax to the price they charge for their <small>OUTPUT</small>. Taxes on companies, for example, are always paid in the end by humans, be they workers, customers or shareholders.</p>

The ratio of the market value of a firm to the net replacement cost of the firm’s assets is known as Tobin’s Q.

If Q is less than 1, the firm would be better off selling its assets, which are worth more than shareholders currently expect the firm to earn in profit by retaining them.</p><p>Tobin also gave his name to the Tobin tax, a so-far-unimplemented proposal to reduce speculative cross-border flows of <small>CAPITAL</small> by levying a small tax on foreign exchange transactions.</p>

<h2>trade area</h2>
<p>In a globalising economy, it is perhaps surprising that countries increasingly trade with their nearest neighbours. One explanation is geography: as countries have lowered their <small>TARIFF</small> barriers, the relatively greater importance of transport costs makes proximity matter more. According to <small>NEW TRADE THEORY</small>, this also produces gains from <small>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</small>. But another reason for the fast <small>GROWTH</small> in trade among nearby countries may be less benign. The proliferation of regional trade agreements may be causing neighbours to trade with each other when it would be more efficient for them to export to and import from afar.</p><p>Since the second world war, more than 300 regional trade agreements have been notified to the <small>GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</small> or the <small>WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION</small>, most of which are still in force. Roughly half of these, including some revisions of previous deals, have been set up since 1990. The best-known are the <small>EUROPEAN UNION, NAFTA</small> (North American Free-Trade Agreement) and Mercosur in South America. There are dozens of other examples.</p><p>Economists have generally been unenthusiastic about regionalism, for two reasons. First, they worry that preferential tariffs will cause trade to flow in inefficient ways, a process known as trade diversion. In a perfect world, trade patterns should be determined by <small>COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</small>: the comparative cost of making different goods yourself as opposed to buying them from various countries. If the US imports Mexican televisions merely because the Mexican goods are tariff-free, even if Malaysia has a comparative advantage in television <small>MANUFACTURING</small>, the main benefit of trade will be lost.</p><p>The second concern is that regionalism will impede efforts to liberalise trade throughout the world. One prominent critic, Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University in New York, has famously said that regional trade areas are “stumbling blocks” rather than “building blocks” in the freeing of global trade. There is no clear theoretical answer to the question of whether regional trade agreements are good or bad, and the empirical findings are hotly disputed. In general, though, it seems likely that it is better to have regional groups that are open to the rest of the world than groups that are closed.</p>

<h2>tragedy of the commons</h2>
<p>A 19th-century amateur mathematician, William Forster Lloyd, modelled the fate of a common pasture shared among rational, <small>UTILITY</small>-maximising herdsmen. He showed that as the population increased the pasture would inevitably be destroyed. This tragedy may be the fate of all sorts of common resources, because no individual, firm or group has meaningful <small>PROPERTY RIGHTS</small> that would make them think twice about using so much of it that it is destroyed.</p><p>Once a resource is being used at a rate near its sustainable capacity, any additional use will reduce its value to its current users. Thus they will increase their usage to maintain the value of the resource to them, resulting in a further deterioration in its value, and so on, until no value remains. Contemporary examples include overfishing and the polluting of the atmosphere. (See <small><a href="#name.512">PUBLIC GOODS</a></small> and <small><a href="#name.207">EXTERNALITY</a></small>.)</p>

<p>The <small>PRICES</small> assumed, for the purposes of calculating tax liability, to have been charged by one unit of a multinational company when selling to another (foreign) unit of the same company. <small>FIRMS</small> spend a fortune on advisers to help them set their transfer prices so that they minimise their total tax bill. For instance, by charging low transfer prices from a unit based in a high-tax country that is selling to a unit in a low-tax country, a firm can record a low <small>PROFIT</small> in the first country and a high profit in the second. In theory, however, transfer prices are supposed to be set according to the arm’s-length principle: that they should be the same as would be charged if the sale was to a business unconnected in any way to the selling firm. But when there is no genuinely independent market with which to compare transfer prices, what an arm’s-length price would be can be a matter of great debate and an opportunity for firms that want to lower their tax bill.</p>

<h2>transparency</h2>
<p>A buzzword for the idea that the more <small>INFORMATION</small> is disclosed about an economic activity the better. Many regulators, private lenders, politicians and economists reckoned that the Asian crisis of the late 1990s would not have been so severe, or even have happened, had Asian <small>GOVERNMENTS, BANKS</small> and other companies made available more and better data about their financial condition. Likewise, the collapse of Enron, a US energy company, in 2001 provoked demands for greater transparency to help improve corporate <small>GOVERNANCE</small> in the US and other industrialised countries. Some economists reckon that transparency is one of the most effective methods of <small>REGULATION</small>. Rather than risk <small>REGULATORY CAPTURE</small>, why not simply maximise disclosure and leave it to the market to decide whether what the information reveals is acceptable?</p>

<h2>trust</h2>
<p>One of the most valuable economic <small>ASSETS</small>, hard to create but easy to destroy – a crucial ingredient of a country’s <small>SOCIAL CAPITAL</small>. People are more likely to do business together when they trust each other. Trust can reduce <small>MARKET FAILURE</small> that otherwise results from <small>ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION</small>. When there is a lack of trust, people may have to spend heavily on monitoring others’ behaviour to ensure they do what they say they will do. This cost may be so high that it is not worth going ahead with a business deal. When trust is absent, people may be less flexible in their dealings with each other. Countries can overcome some of the problems of a lack of trust by passing laws requiring good behaviour, but only to the extent that people trust that the laws will be enforced. One way in which companies seek to demonstrate that they can be trusted is by investing heavily in a <small>BRAND</small>.</p>

<h2>unemployment</h2>
<p>The number of people of working age without a job is usually expressed as an unemployment rate, a percentage of the workforce. This rate generally rises and falls in step with the <small>BUSINESS CYCLE</small> – cyclical unemployment. But some joblessness is not caused by the cycle, being <small>STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. There are also <small>VOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT</small> and involuntary unemployment. Some people who are not in work have no interest in getting a job and probably should not be regarded as part of the workforce. Others choose to be out of work briefly while they look for, or are waiting to start, a new job. This is known as <small>FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. In the 1950s, the <small>PHILLIPS CURVE</small> seemed to show that policymakers could reduce unemployment by having higher <small>INFLATION</small>. Economists now say there is a <small>NAIRU</small> (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). In most markets, <small>PRICES</small> change to keep <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small> in <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>; in the <small>LABOUR</small> market, <small>WAGES</small> are often sticky, being slow to fall when demand declines or supply increases. In these situations, unemployment often increases. One way to tackle this may be to boost demand. Another is to increase <small>LABOUR-MARKET FLEXIBILITY</small>.</p>

<h2>unions</h2>
<p>In developed countries, at least, trade union membership and influence has declined over the past few decades. Fewer <small>WAGES</small> are now set by collective bargaining, and far fewer working days are lost to strikes. Unions, which are in effect a <small>CARTEL</small> of workers, probably make <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small> higher than it would be without them, as collective bargaining often pushes wages above the level that would bring the <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small> of <small>LABOUR</small> into <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>. These higher wages increase supply and reduce demand, with the result that there are more jobless people. Unions thus deepen a conflict between those in the labour market who are insiders, that is, union members, and those who are outsiders, typically non-unionised, poorly paid or jobless people. However, unions can combat the excessive <small>MARKET POWER</small> of some <small>FIRMS</small>, particularly when the firms (or a <small>GOVERNMENT</small>) dominate a particular job market. They can support workers who are badly treated by management and promote safer workplaces. They sometimes provide an efficient, and thus valuable, channel for communication between workers and managers, particularly in countries such as Germany, where conflict between management and unions is viewed as unhealthy.</p>

<h2>usury</h2>
<p>Charging <small>INTEREST</small>, or, at least, an exorbitant rate of interest. Plato and Aristotle reckoned that charging interest was “contrary to the nature of things”; Cato considered it on a par with homicide. For many centuries, the Catholic Church regarded as sinful the charging of any interest by lenders and it was not allowed in Catholic countries, although Jews were exempted, provided they did not charge excessive rates. According to Pope Benedict XIV in 1745, interest should be regarded as a sin because “the <small>CREDITOR</small> desires more than he has given”. In most modern economies, interest is recognised as a crucial part of the economic system, a reward to the lender for the <small>RISK</small> taken in making a loan. Even so, many countries have some form of usury law imposing limits on how high interest charges can be to protect borrowers from being exploited by loan sharks.</p>

<h2>utility</h2>
<p>Economist-speak for a good thing; a measure of satisfaction. (See also <small><a href="#name.720">WELFARE</a></small>.) Underlying most economic theory is the assumption that people do things because doing so gives them utility. People want as much utility as they can get. But the more they have, the less difference an additional unit of utility will make: there is diminishing <small>MARGINAL</small> utility. Utility is not the same as utilitarianism, a political philosophy based on achieving the greatest happiness of the greatest number.</p><p>A tricky question is how to measure utility. <small>MONEY</small> does not (entirely) capture it. You can get richer without becoming more satisfied. So some economists have tried to calculate broader measures of happiness. They have found that people with jobs are much happier than unemployed people. Low <small>INFLATION</small> also makes people happier. Extra <small>INCOME</small> increases happiness a bit, but not much. In many countries incomes have risen sharply in recent years, but national surveys show subjective well-being has stayed flat. Within countries, comparing people across the income distribution, richer does mean happier, but the effect is not large. Married people are often happier than single people; couples without children happier than couples with; women happier than men; white people happier than black people; well-educated people happier than uneducated people; the self-employed happier than employees; and retired people happier than economically active people. Happiness generally decreases until you are in your 30s, and then starts rising again.</p><p>Some economists are dismissive of such studies. They argue that people are rational maximisers of their own utility, so, by definition, whatever they do maximises it.</p>

It is therefore a measure of the <small>PROFIT</small> earned by a particular firm plus the <small>WAGES</small> it has paid. As a rule, the more value a firm can add to a product, the more successful it will be.

<h2>wages</h2>
<p>The price of <small>LABOUR</small>. In theory, wages ought to change so that the <small>SUPPLY</small> and <small>DEMAND</small> in the labour market are always in <small>EQUILIBRIUM</small>. In practice, wages are often sticky, especially in a downward direction: when demand for labour falls, wages do not fall. In this situation, the fall in demand results in higher involuntary <small>UNEMPLOYMENT</small>. Trade <small>UNIONS</small> may use collective bargaining to keep wages above the market-clearing rate. Furthermore, many <small>GOVERNMENTS</small> impose a <small>MINIMUM WAGE</small> that employers must pay.</p><p><small>FIRMS</small> may choose to pay above the equilibrium wage to increase the <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> of workers. Such so-called <small>EFFICIENCY</small> wages may make workers less likely to join another firm, thus cutting the employer’s hiring and training costs. They may encourage workers to do a better job. They may also attract a higher quality of worker than wages at the market-clearing rate; better workers may have a higher <small>RESERVATION WAGE</small> (the lowest wage for which they are willing to work) than the market-clearing equilibrium.</p><p>In recent years, employers have tried to reduce wage stickiness by increasing the proportion of pay that is linked to the performance of their firm. Thus if falling demand reduces the employer’s <small>PROFIT</small>, the pay of its employees falls automatically, so it does not have to lay off as many workers as it otherwise would. Performance-related wages can also reduce <small>AGENCY COSTS</small> by giving hired hands a stronger incentive to do a good job.</p>

<h2>wealth effect</h2>
<p>As people get wealthier, they consume more. This wealth effect has important consequences for <small>MONETARY POLICY</small>. When there is an <small>INTEREST-RATE</small> increase, future <small>INCOME</small> from <small>ASSETS</small> such as <small>SHARES</small> must be discounted at a higher rate than before. As a result their owners feel poorer and spend less. A cut in interest rates has the opposite effect. Economists disagree on the wealth <small>ELASTICITY</small> of <small>CONSUMPTION</small>: how much consumer spending would rise if wealth increased by, say, 1%. Different consumers may have different wealth elasticity. If most of the increase in wealth goes to poorer people, this may have a different wealth effect than if most of it went to people who are already wealthy. The source of the wealth increase may also matter. If share prices rise or interest rates fall, consumers may be slow to spend out of their increased wealth if they think the increase may be temporary. However, if they think a sharp rise in share <small>PRICES</small> is permanent and the stockmarket then tumbles, the result may be that consumption falls by enough to cause a <small>RECESSION</small>. The wealth effect of rising, or falling, <small>HOUSE PRICES</small> is particularly uncertain.</p>

<h2>wealth tax</h2>
<p>In most countries, the majority of wealth is concentrated in a fairly small number of hands. This makes a wealth tax appealing to politicians, as it should allow substantial amounts of revenue to be raised from comparatively few people, allowing the <small>TAX BURDEN</small> on the majority of the population to be kept down. It also appeals because it promotes meritocracy by making it harder to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth. A wealth tax reduces the disparities in wealth rather than <small>INCOME</small> that are the biggest determinant of how the scales are weighted for succeeding generations. What could be better than a tax that produces lots of <small>MONEY</small> for the <small>GOVERNMENT</small> and strikes most voters as being extremely fair?</p><p>Alas, as critics point out, wealth taxes may cause <small>INEFFICIENCY</small> by discouraging wealth-creating economic activities. Moreover, the revenue collected may prove disappointing. The wealthiest people are often the most skilled at <small>TAX AVOIDANCE</small>, not least because they can afford good tax accountants. Despite the enormous concentration of wealth in a small part of the population, on average across the <small>OECD</small> wealth taxes account for less than 2% of total tax revenue.</p><p>A wealth tax can achieve <small>HORIZONTAL EQUITY</small> and <small>VERTICAL EQUITY</small> (so that people of similar means pay the same and those with more pay more) in ways that <small>INCOME TAX</small> cannot. For instance, neither a poor person nor a rich person with no income would pay income tax, and only the rich person would pay the wealth tax.</p><p>Wealth taxes come in two main forms. <small>CAPITAL</small> transfer taxes are levied when wealth changes hands, either at death (inheritance tax) or through donation (gift tax). Annual wealth taxes are levied each year as a fraction of the taxpayer’s net worth. Some people regard <small>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</small> as a wealth tax, but in reality it is a tax on the income earned on capital, rather than a wealth tax on the capital itself.</p>

<p>A controversial concept, often used by politicians to justify imposing a tax on <small>PROFIT</small> that in theory is earned unexpectedly, through circumstances beyond the control of the company concerned, and is thus deemed undeserved and ripe for the taking by the tax authorities. As the profits were neither expected nor a result of the efforts of the firm, taxing them should not harm the firm’s incentives to maximise future profits. The problem comes when greedy politicians start claiming that profits are windfalls when in fact they are deserved and expected. Then taxing them sends a signal to <small>FIRMS</small> that they should not try too hard to make profits, as if they do too well they will not get to keep the profits anyway.

Its advice has often been guided by economic fashion, which led it to support a centrally planned brand of <small>DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS</small> in the 1960s and 1970s, before switching to <small>PRIVATISATION</small> and <small>STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT</small> in the 1980s, and then to promoting democracy and economic <small>TRANSPARENCY</small>, and attacking <small>CRONY CAPITALISM</small>, in the late 1990s. Until recently, it has generally supported big, high-profile projects rather than more economically useful smaller schemes. It has often failed to ensure that its loans have been spent on the intended project. Its willingness to pump money into struggling countries creates a potential <small>MORAL HAZARD</small>, in which politicians may have little incentive to govern well because they believe that, if they do a bad job, the World Bank will come to the rescue. The increase in private-sector lending to and <small>INVESTMENT</small> in emerging markets has led to growing discussion of whether the World Bank is any longer needed.</p>

<h2>World Trade Organisation</h2>
<p><i>Bête noire</i> of anti-<small>GLOBALISATION</small> protesters. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is the governing body of international trade, setting and enforcing the rules of trade and punishing offenders. Established during the Uruguay Round of talks under the <small>GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</small> (GATT), it opened for business in 1995 with a membership of 132 countries (rising to 153 by 2009, representing 95% of world trade). Countries used to break GATT rules with impunity. They seem to be finding it harder to do so under the WTO. Even so, protesters complain that it does not promote <small>FAIR TRADE</small>, but it does promote the interests of rich countries over poorer ones. Supporters of <small>FREE TRADE</small>, including <i>The Economist,</i> reckon that all countries are better off as part of a well-regulated international trading system, and that the WTO is the most likely source of the good <small>REGULATION</small> that is needed. Moreover, the WTO is unusually democratic for a multilateral organisation, with every member country, however small, having an equal vote. Even so, the failure to achieve significant new multilateral trade deals under the “Doha round” that started in 2001 raised questions about how long the WTO could survive.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<a name='name.731'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>x-efficiency</h2>
<p>Producing <small>OUTPUT</small> at the minimum possible cost. This is not enough to ensure the best sort of economic <small>EFFICIENCY</small>, which maximises society’s total consumer plus producer surplus, because the quantity of output produced may not be ideal. For instance, a <small>MONOPOLY</small> can be an x-efficient producer, but to maximise its <small>PROFIT</small> it may produce a different quantity of output than there would be in a surplus-maximising market with <small>PERFECT COMPETITION</small>.</p>

<h3>Y</h3>

<a name='name.733'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>yield</h2>
<p>The annual <small>INCOME</small> from a <small>SECURITY</small>, expressed as a percentage of the current market price of the security. The yield on a <small>SHARE</small> is its <small>DIVIDEND</small> divided by its <small>PRICE</small>. A <small>BOND</small> yield is also known as its <small>INTEREST RATE</small>: the annual coupon divided by the market price.</p>

<a name='name.734'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>yield curve</h2>
<p>Shorthand for comparisons of the <small>INTEREST RATE</small> on <small>GOVERNMENT BONDS</small> of different maturity. If investors think it is riskier to buy a bond with 15 years until it matures than a bond with five years of life, they will demand a higher interest rate (<small>YIELD</small>) on the longer-dated bond. If so, the yield curve will slope upwards from left (the shorter maturities) to right. It is normal for the yield curve to be positive (upward-sloping, left to right) simply because investors normally demand compensation for the added <small>RISK</small> of holding longer-term <small>SECURITIES</small>. Historically, a downward-sloping (or inverted) yield curve has been an indicator of <small>RECESSION</small> on the horizon, or, at least, that investors expect the <small>CENTRAL BANK</small> to cut short-term interest rates in the near future. A flat yield curve means that investors are indifferent to maturity risk, but this is unusual. When the yield curve as a whole moves higher, it means that investors are more worried that <small>INFLATION</small> will rise for the foreseeable future and therefore that higher interest rates will be needed. When the whole curve moves lower, it means that investors have a rosier inflationary outlook.</p><p>Even if the direction (up or down) of a yield curve is unchanged, useful <small>INFORMATION</small> can be gleaned from changes in the spreads between yields on bonds of different maturities and on different sorts of bonds with the same maturity (such as government bonds versus corporate bonds, or thinly traded bonds versus highly liquid bonds).</p>

<a name='name.735'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>yield gap</h2>
<p>A way of comparing the performance of <small>BONDS</small> and <small>SHARES</small>. The gap is defined as the <small>AVERAGE YIELD</small> on shares minus the average yield on <small>BONDS</small>. Because shares are usually riskier investments than bonds, you might expect them to have a higher yield. In practice, the yield gap is often negative, with bonds yielding more than equities. This is not because investors regard equities as safer than bonds (see <a href="#name.189"><small>EQUITY RISK PREMIUM</small></a>). Rather, it is that they expect most of the benefit from buying shares to come from an increase in their <small>PRICE</small> (<small>CAPITAL</small> appreciation) rather than from <small>DIVIDEND</small> payments. Bond investors usually expect more of their gains to come from coupon payments. They also worry that <small>INFLATION</small> will erode the value of future coupons in <small>REAL TERMS</small>, making them value current payments more highly than those due in years to come. Moreover, the usefulness of the dividend yield as a guide to the performance of shares has declined since the early 1990s, as increasingly companies have chosen to return cash to shareholders by buying back their own shares rather than paying out bigger dividends.</p>

<a name='name.737'>&nbsp;</a>
<h2>zero-sum game</h2>
<p>When the gains made by winners in an economic transaction equal the losses suffered by the losers. It is identified as a special case in <small>GAME THEORY</small>. Most economic transactions are in some sense positive-sum games. But in popular discussion of economic issues, there are often examples of a mistaken zero-sum mentality, such as “<small>PROFIT</small> comes at the expense of <small>WAGES</small>”, “higher <small>PRODUCTIVITY</small> means fewer jobs”, and “<small>IMPORTS</small> mean fewer jobs here”.</p>
