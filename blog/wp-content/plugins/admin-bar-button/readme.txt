Hide the WordPress admin bar until you need it.

== Description ==

Admin Bar Button is a plugin that will create a simple button to replace the WordPress admin bar on the front end.  Clicking the button (or hovering over it) will then show the WordPress admin bar.
When using this plugin, the full height of the page is used by your site, which is particularly handy if you have fixed headers.
Please see the [Screenshots tab](http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-bar-button/screenshots/ "Admin Bar Button &raquo; Screenshots") to see how the Admin Bar Button looks.

After activating the plugin, you can change how the Admin Bar Button looks and works by visiting the **Settings** page (*Settings &raquo; Admin Bar Button*).
However, **no user interaction is required** by the plugin; if you wish, you can simply install and activate Admin Bar Button and it'll work right away.

This plugin has been tested with the **Twenty Sixteen**, **Twenty Fifteen**, and **Twenty Fourteen** themes that are shipped with WordPress 4.5.
Should you find a theme with which it does not work, please open a new topic on the [Support tab](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/admin-bar-button "Admin Bar Button &raquo; Support").
